Name: Ability Rip
Level: 6
School: Necromancy
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 5 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Description:
You can rob a creature of one of its inherent
aptitudes and give that capability to an ally. Choose
one ability score. One creature of your choice
within range makes a saving throw with that ability
score. On a failure, the target has disadvantage on
checks and saving throws with the chosen ability
score. In addition, the target has disadvantage on
attack rolls using the chosen ability score, and deals
only half damage with such attacks if they are
weapon attacks.
When you cast this spell, choose another willing
creature within 30 feet. For the duration, that
creature gains advantage on all ability checks and
saving throws with the ability score you chose. In
addition, that creature gains 25 temporary hit
points.
At the end of each of the first target’s turns, it can
make a saving throw against the spell. It makes the
saving throw with the ability score you chose, but
the disadvantage inflicted by this spell does not
affect saving throws against it. On a successful save,
the spell ends.
“A poorly named spell. ‘Rip’ implies one
tears it away forever, but in truth, one
only borrows the ability for a brief
while. Pity.”

has these temporary hit points, its wearer has
resistance to all damage except psychic damage.
Each time the wearer takes damage that is not
psychic damage, the same amount of damage is

are depleted, if the armor is doffed, or if the spell is
cast again on the same suit of armor. You can also

A burst of energy radiates from you in a 30-foot
radius, dispelling shadowy foes and magical
darkness alike. Creatures of your choice within 30

vulnerability to radiant damage have disadvantage
on this saving throw.
If the spell’s area overlaps with an area of

other spell ends. Multiple magical darkness spells
can be abolished in this way.

Name: Absorption Ward
Level: 9
School: Abjuration

Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M (incense made from rare
Duration: 1 hour
Description:
This spell creates an arcane ward that surrounds
and protects you, harmlessly absorbing the energy
of spells that target you to fuel your own casting.
For the duration, you can use the ward as a reaction
to absorb a spell that is targeting only you and
which does not have an area of effect. The absorbed
spell's effect is canceled, and the spell's energy—not
the spell itself—is stored in the ward.
Once the ward absorbs a spell, you can use the
captured spell energy, which has the same level as
the spell when it was cast. The ward can absorb a
number of spell levels equal to half your level + your
spellcasting ability modifier. Once the ward absorbs
that number of levels of spell energy, it can't absorb
more. If you are targeted by a spell that the ward
can't store, the ward has no effect on that spell. You
always know how much spell energy your ward has
absorbed and how many spell levels are currently
stored within it.
You can convert levels of spell energy stored in
your ward to cast spells you have prepared or know,
creating new spell slots from the stored energy
rather than using slots of your own. You can create
spell slots only of a level equal to or lower than your
own highest-level spell slots, up to a maximum of
5th level. You use the stored levels of spell energy in
place of your own spell slots, but otherwise cast the
spell as normal. For example, you can use 3 levels of
spells stored in the ward as a 3rd-level spell slot.
Any spell levels remaining in the ward when the
spell ends are lost.
“I carried a
rod of absorption for many years, but lost it
recently during an ambush on Avernus. The ambushers paid
the price, but since that time I instead prepare this spell, which
grants what is essentially the same effect.”

points for each Hit Die spent. In addition, the

target recovers from that poison or disease.

“The aegis spells were first researched and
perfected by swordmages, warriors combining
spellcasting and prowess with a blade.
Swordmages were never common, but their
numbers grew after the elves reclaimed ruined
Myth Drannor for a time and began teaching
the swordmage’s art there. However, since that
returned center of elvendom was again laid low
by the fall of the City of Shade, few new
swordmages have been trained. Of course,
eldritch knights and elven bladesingers aren’t
too common either, but now it is their use of
swordmage techniques in their own fighting
arts that keeps this unique practice of magic
from falling back into obscurity.”

increases by 5 feet, and you have advantage on all
rolls to make or escape a grapple.
Before the spell ends, you can give yourself
advantage on one melee weapon attack
roll. On a hit, that attack deals an extra
5d4 damage of the same type as the
attack.
For the spell's duration, you also
suffer disadvantage on Charisma

Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous
Description:
If you have at least 2 hit points when you cast this
spell, you can transfer any number of your own hit
points to a willing creature you touch. Each hit
point you transfer deals one damage to you and
heals your target for one hit point. You cannot give
the target more hit points than their normal

Name: Amanuensis
Level: cantrip

Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 30 feet
Components: V, S, M (any kind of blank paper)
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
Description:
You choose any nonmagical writing you can see
within range and it is magically copied onto blank
paper you are holding. This spell copies 250 words
per minute and creates a perfect duplicate of the
original. It does not translate the text or make it
clearer.
Illustrations or magical writings (such as the text
of a spellbook, a spell scroll, or a glyph of warding)
are not copied at all by this spell. If the original text
contains both normal writing and magical writing
or illustrations (such as a letter with a glyph of
warding or a drawing in one corner), only the
normal text is copied.
You must provide blank paper in some form for
the spell to copy the text onto. If a blank sheet is
filled with copied text, you must cast the spell again
with a new blank sheet of paper to continue copying
more text.

Description:
blood of a black dragon and squid ink, which is
consumed by the spell)
You shake the glass orb as the noxious mixture
inside starts to bubble and smoke. You hurl the orb
at a point you can see within range. When the orb
reaches that point it shatters, releasing a sickening
form of ooze, a black pudding (your DM has
statistics for this creature). The black pudding turns
into a disgusting puddle of sticky tar when it’s
reduced to 0 hit points or the spell ends.
The ooze is friendly to you. Roll initiative for the
ooze, which has its own turns. The pudding follows
your verbal commands (this does not require an
action) to the best of its ability. If you don’t give the
pudding any commands it will move up to 20 feet
towards the nearest creature that isn’t you and
attack.
Amplify Sound

=== SPELL START ===
Name: Amplify Sound
Level: 1

Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 300 feet
Components: S
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
Description:
This spell greatly increases the volume of all sound
in a 15-foot radius sphere centered on a creature or
object of your choice within range. If an unwilling
creature is targeted by this spell, it must make a
Wisdom saving throw; on a failed save, the spell
successfully targets the creature. If the save is
successful, the spell fails.
Once the spell takes effect, a creature outside of
the spell’s area listening to sounds coming from
within the area has advantage on Wisdom
(Perception) checks to discern sounds within the
area. This amplifying effect isn’t noticeable by
creatures within the affected area. The spell has no
effect when targeting a creature or object in an area
affected by the silence spell or another effect that
quiets all sound.

Name: Analyze Contraption

Range: Special
Components: V, S, M (a special consecrated book
Duration: Instantaneous
Description:
For the duration, you gain advantage on
Intelligence (Investigation) checks to figure out how
a device, trap, or mechanism works. If you are
successful on your Investigation check when
analyzing one of these devices, you gain advantage
on any ability checks used to disarm or operate the
object’s mechanisms for the duration.
Analyze Dweomer
8th-level divination (ritual)
sapphire set in a golden hoop worth at least 1000
gp)
Upon casting this spell, you can identify the magic
affecting all creatures and objects within range. For
magic items or other magic-imbued objects, you
learn their properties and how to use them, whether
they require attunement to use, and how many
charges they have (if any). You also learn whether
any spells are affecting the item and what they are.
If the item was created by a spell, you learn which
spell created it.
For creatures within range, you learn what spells,
if any, are currently affecting them.
Analyze Portal
2nd-level divination (ritual)
You can see the outline of any magic portal within
range. If you study a portal for 1 round, you can
learn one of the following things:
 Any special key or command word required to
activate the portal
 Any specific circumstance to activate the portal
(a time of day for instance)
 Whether the portal is one-way or two-way
 Whether the portal is functioning correctly or
not
 A glimpse of where the portal leads. The
glimpse lasts for 1 second, and you can see about
20 feet beyond the portal
For every round you focus on the portal, you
learn one more of the listed pieces of information.
Anathema
9th-lvel enchantment (ritual)
or scroll inscribed with the target’s name, detailing
the crimes for which the target is being condemned
and requiring 10,000 gp worth of special metallic
inks and rare mineral dusts to inscribe, which is
consumed in the casting of the spell)
You can permanently exclude a creature from the
benefits of your faith. The chosen creature suffers
the following effects:
 It can no longer cast any cleric, druid, paladin,
or ranger spells gained from the worship of your
deity.
 It can no longer use the Channel Divinity
feature if it is derived from the worship of your
deity.
 It cannot benefit from any of your faith’s
services, such as spellcasting provided by a
temple of your faith, or naming, marrying, or
burial services.
 If it dies, its soul is barred from entry into your
deity’s plane, just as if it had never declared
allegiance to your deity.
If you target a higher-level spellcaster than yourself
with this spell, the spell fails. A creature targeted
with this spell is instantly aware of all of its effects,
and that you are the caster. You can pronounce an
anathema effect upon any creature, even if it is on a
different plane. You cannot pronounce an anathema
against someone who is already dead. Some deities
do not allow an anathema to be pronounced against
the innocent or against their chosen, while others
grant their most powerful servants free use of this
most terrible of divine curses.
The anathema spell marks the subject as accursed
to others of your faith. If they are aware that a
creature is anathema, members of your faith feel
instinctively that they will displease their deity if
they speak to that creature, look at it, or even
acknowledge its existence. Clerics, paladins, druids,
and rangers of your faith automatically detect an
anathema effect simply by looking at the subject.
The effect is permanent until lifted, either by you
or another member of your faith of higher level who
can cast this spell. This spell is unaffected by dispel
magic or counterspell, and it can be neither copied
nor undone by a wish spell.
In campaigns featuring less traditional faiths
(such as worship of whole pantheons or sub-groups
of gods, gods with multiple aspects, a non-personal
sacred philosophy, etc.), the DM determines the
effects of this spell relative to such beliefs and
explains them when you acquire this spell.

Components: V, S, M (a sprig of nightshade)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Description:
You fix your magically empowered gaze upon one
creature you can see within range, forcing it to
make a Wisdom saving throw. If it succeeds, the
spell has no effect. On a failure, it gains resistance
to all nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing and
slashing damage until the spell ends. However, for
the same duration, its movement rate is reduced by
half, it has disadvantage on all Dexterity saves for
the duration, and it can’t use reactions or bonus
actions until the spell ends. During the target’s turn
it can only take one action, and it cannot move
unless that action is one that includes movement
(such as the Dash action). Also, the target cannot
cast spells for the duration. A creature affected by
this spell can repeat the Wisdom saving throw at
the end of each of its turns, ending the spell on a
success.
“Hearty minions of dubious intellect can
often benefit from this spell if their
enemies are close at hand.”

This spell cancels any magical darkness it touches
if the darkness was created by a spell of equal level

Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour
Description:
You can borrow some of the senses of a beast you
touch. During each of your turns you can use a
bonus action to see what the beast sees and hear
what it hears until the start of your next turn,
gaining the benefits of any special senses that beast
may possess. During this time, you are deaf and
blind with regard to your own senses. If the beast
moves more than 1 mile away from you, the spell
ends.
This spell only affects beasts with an Intelligence
score of 3 or less. It can also affect creatures that are
not beasts, but which are familiars (per the find
familiar spell), provided they have an Intelligence of
3 or less. You don’t gain any control over the beast
or any communication with it other than seeing and
hearing through its senses.
If you cast this spell on a creature that is tied to
another intelligent creature by a class feature or
spell (such as a wizard’s familiar or a ranger’s
animal companion), then the intelligent creature to
whom the target of this spell is tied can make a
Wisdom saving throw when you cast this spell. If
that save succeeds, the spell fails. Whether the roll
succeeds or fails, the intelligent creature tied to the
beast gains no special awareness of this spell or its
effects.
Animate Blood
=== SPELL END ===

=== SPELL START ===
Name: Animate Blood
Level: 6
School: Necromancy
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self
Components: V, S, M (a drop of blood)
Duration: 1 hour
Description:
You deal yourself 1 slashing or piercing damage to
yourself to shed some blood, which you animate
into a tiny humanlike construct called a bloodling.
Bloodlings look like tiny humanoids made out of
dark red wax. Bloodlings are tiny, they have a speed
of 40 feet, an AC 18, 5 hp, and darkvision out to 60
feet. They are ineffective in combat but have +10 to
Dexterity (stealth) checks. They are too weak to
carry anything that weighs more than 5 pounds.
As long as the bloodling is within 120 feet you can
use an action to look through the bloodling’s eyes
and give it telepathic commands. You can specify a
general action such as “climb that” or “open that
book,” or you can take complete control of the
bloodling. The bloodling will take whatever actions
you command it to and nothing else.
When you cast a spell with a range of touch, the
bloodling can deliver the spell as if it had been the
caster. The bloodling must be within 120 feet of you,
and it must use its reaction to deliver the spell when
you cast it. If the spell requires an attack roll, you
use your attack modifier for the roll. Whether or
not the spell is successful, when you have a
bloodling deliver a spell in this way, your animate
blood spell ends and the bloodling is destroyed.

Description:
You send gathered necrotic energy cascading into
the ground around you, and seconds later corpses
within the area start to twitch and drag themselves
to their feet. You choose a number of corpses within
range equal to your spellcasting ability modifier and
animate them, as if with the animate dead spell.
Treat these animated corpses as zombies, with
the following exceptions. The zombies follow your
commands to the best of their ability but are not
intelligent and take things very literally. Each
zombie’s initiative is the same as yours, but its turn
does not take place until yours ends. If you do not
issue a new command to the zombie, it will
continue to follow any previous orders if possible,
otherwise it takes the dodge action. Undead
animated by this spell cannot be turned. When
reduced to 0 hit points or after the spell ends, each
zombie turns back into a lifeless corpse.

This spell grants you the ability to cast any one spell
of your choice from the wizard spell list, provided it
is a 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th level spell. As part of the
action used to cast this spell, you must read the
spell you intend to cast directly from a scroll or a
wizard’s spellbook, or the spell fails (reading from a
spell scroll in this way does not use the spell scroll).
Once you cast anyspell, the spell you chose and
read can be cast any time until the end of your next
turn, using the required casting time and
components. (Therefore, spells that take longer
than 1 round to cast are usually not suitable choices
this spell.) To cast the chosen spell, you must still

much on a successful one. This spell fouls rivers,
destroys forests and devastates towns and castles.
Thousands of innocent lives could be lost.
Casting this spell is an unquestionably evil act.
Other gods take notice, and often warn their
followers or send servants to deal with you directly.
Channeling the essence of entropy takes a direct toll
on the caster as well: when you cast this spell, you

0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to
your normal form.
 You can’t cast spells, and your ability to speak or

the capabilities of a wolf. Transforming doesn’t
break your concentration on a spell you’ve
already cast, however, or prevent you from

“Few spells ever inspire anything in me that
would be akin to fear. Yet awaken construct is
one of these, for a simple reason: I cannot

“At first I wondered why Khelben included this
spell, as he had always strongly disliked its
creator—the same Oeridian wizard famous for
the many hand-themed spells he developed,
which were later consolidated into the single
spell Bigby’s hand. Khelben often said that
Bigby ‘comes up with one good gimmick, and
beats it to death with a rock.’
“I asked him why he copied this spell into so
many of his grimoires, given this acrimony.
Khelben said he enjoyed ‘the novelty of Bigby
finally having one spell he didn’t base on
appendages.’”

“My understanding was that Khelben’s true rivalry with my
former apprentice Bigby began when they both competed for the
love of the same woman.”

whispers menacingly, filling your foes' minds with
despair. Choose any number of creatures you can

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Description:
1 sp)
You temporarily become a creature of shadow,
flickering in and out of a demiplane on the borders
of the Shadowfell as your weapon ripples with dark
magic. Until the spell ends, you have resistance to
necrotic damage, and you inflict 3d4 additional
necrotic damage whenever you hit a creature with a
melee weapon attack.
For the duration, you roll a d20 at the end of each
of your turns. On a roll of 11 or higher, you vanish
from your current plane of existence and appear in
a shadowy reflection of it, which lies somewhere on
the planar boundary between your current location
and the Shadowfell. (If you are already in the
Shadowfell when you cast this spell, the spell fails
and the casting is wasted.) At the start of you next
turn, and when the spell ends if you are in the
shadowy reflection, you return to an unoccupied
space of your choice that you can see within 10 feet
of the space you vanished from. If no unoccupied
space is available within that range, you appear in
the nearest unoccupied space (chosen at random if
more than one space is equally near). You can
dismiss this spell as an action.
While in the shadowy reflection, you can see and
hear the plane you originated from, but everything
is lightly obscured, and you can't see anything more
than 30 feet away. You are not truly in the
Shadowfell nor in your previous location during
that time, but somewhere in between the planes.
Whenever you are in the shadowy reflection, only
other creatures with resistance or immunity to
necrotic damage can see you or affect you, or be
affected by you.

Once you cast this spell, your speed is reduced to 0
until the start of your next turn. However, as part of
the action used to cast this spell, you can choose
any number of creatures within 5 feet of you and
make one melee weapon attack against each one,

While this spell is active, if you have a weapon in
each hand, until the start of your next turn, when a

Before the beginning of your next turn, if the
target is hit with an attack, it takes an additional 1d4
necrotic damage, and the spell ends. When this

to your spellcasting ability modifier plus the
amount of necrotic damage the creature took.
The necrotic damage increases by an extra 1d4
when you reach 5th level (2d4), 11th level (3d4), and
17th level (4d4).
“The creation of many cursing spells is
often attributed to the Vistani of the
benighted realm known as Barovia, or to
the Gur culture of Faerûn's own Western
Heartlands. However, this usually arises
from a prejudiced attempt to paint entire
human ethnicities as somehow innately
villainous. Those who know these
cultures well can attest that they are no
worthier of general mistrust than any
other human group.”

“The
blurred step cantrip was developed in imitation of a
psionic power, taught in an intriguing tome known as the
Talaric Codex. This ancient document now exists only in
fragments, but it posits the theory that psionic powers become
more common on any world in direct proportion to how much of
a threat invading aberrations from the Far Realm pose to that
plane.
“Of course, that is a difficult theory to prove or disprove.
What few can deny is that the psychic warriors who mastered
the
blurred step, known as battleminds, were relentless in
hunting down descendants of the Far Realm such as illithids
and aboleths. This particular power made it very difficult for
their quarry to escape.”

the bladelings, a race hailing from the plane of
Acheron. They have skin of a dull metallic hue,

Guide). The effects of the madness are immediate
and last for 24 hours. If you rolled the same results

duration of its madness to make an Intelligence
saving throw with advantage, contracting the same

while it is within 5 feet of you, it has disadvantage
on the attack.

by this spell. Both damage rolls increase by 1d8 at
11th level and 17th level.

mark is not a true magical effect, but is
rather a product of intimidation,

1st-level transmutation (ritual)
container that can hold a draught of water)

substances, focused meditation, and magic to
transform the water in a container you have on your

dose can be applied to one weapon, up to three
pieces of ammunition, or up to three separate
portions of food or drink. Once applied, the poison
retains potency until someone must roll a saving
throw against it, or for 1 minute, after which point it

poisoned food or drink, it must make a Constitution
save or be poisoned for 1 minute and take 1d8
poison damage, or 2d8 if the poison is ingested).
Creatures that succeed on their save take half

Duration: Concentration, up to 24 hours
Description:
one black onyx stone worth 250 gp)
You raise one corpse of a Medium or Small
humanoid as a revenant under your temporary
influence. (The DM has game statistics for
revenants).
Once raised, the revenant is friendly to you and
your companions for the duration. It obeys any
verbal commands that you issue to it. The revenant
is under your control for 24 hours, after which time
it stops obeying any command you have given it.
When you cast this spell, you must choose one
unfriendly creature within 1 mile of you on which
you wish to seek revenge, and against whom the
revenant also swears vengeance (though only for
the duration). If you do not choose a target for
vengeance, the revenant ceases to be under your
control.
If you don't issue any commands to the revenant,
it attacks the subject of its sworn vengeance,
moving toward that creature if it can, and defends
itself from hostile creatures. If you cast this spell
while you already have a revenant under your
control from a prior casting of this spell, the
previous spell ends and the existing revenant leaves
your service as described above.
The revenant will not seek revenge against you
for animating it with this spell. Once this spell ends,
however, if you wronged it during its life, or if you
stirred its vengeance against you by any of the
deeds you committed or forced it to commit during
its service to you, it may make you a target for its
vengeance.
If the revenant has vengeance in its heart towards
another creature, it will seek revenge against it once
your control ends. If the revenant does not burn
with the need for vengeance, it becomes a dead
corpse once more.
Once a corpse has been the subject of this spell, it
cannot be transformed into a revenant again by this
spell for 100 years.

creature ye just killed into a revenant!”

Dead Man’s Tell
1st-level divination (ritual)
which must be flexible in some way)
You imbue a body part taken from a criminal’s
corpse—such as a hand, finger or head—with
divinatory powers that cause it to react. Choose one
of the categories of things it can detect and react to
below. When something that falls within the chosen
category or selected subcategories comes within 30
feet of the body part that has become the dead
man’s tell item, it activates. You can choose one of
the following categories of things to activate the
dead man’s tell item:
 Alignment. Choose one of the following
alignments: good, evil, lawful, or chaotic. The
dead man’s tell item activates when it is within
30 feet of a creature that has such an alignment.
 Consecration/Desecration. The dead man’s
tell item activates when it is within 30 feet of a
place or object that has been magically
consecrated or desecrated (as with the hallow
spell).
 Creature. Select one or more types of creatures
from the following list: aberrations, beasts,
constructs, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends,
giants, monstrosities, oozes, plants, or undead.
You can also choose one or more races of
humanoids (such as humans or goblins). You
can choose as many or as few of these types as
you like. The dead man’s tell item activates
when it is within 30 feet of one of the chosen
creature types.
 Disease. The dead man’s tell item activates
when it is within 30 feet of an object or creature
that carries a disease with which it can infect
other creatures.
 Magic. Choose magic items, spellcasting,
scrying attempts, or general magical effects. The
dead man’s tell item activates when it is within
30 feet of one of the chosen effects.
 Poison. The dead man’s tell item activates when
it is within 30 feet of poison or poisonous
creatures,
 Secret Door. The dead man’s tell item activates
when it is within 30 feet of a secret door.
 Trap. The dead man’s tell item activates when it
is within 30 feet of a hidden trap or disguised pit
or snare.
The first time the dead man’s tell item detects one
or more of the chosen category or subcategories of
subjects within 30 feet, it activates. When activated,
the item violently spasms for one round; a hand
clenches, a finger jerks, jaws chatter and the like.
The dead man’s tell item does not indicate the
power or location of the subject it has detected,
merely its presence within 30 feet at the time of its
activation. After being activated, the spell ends, and
the body part rapidly decays and dessicates
(meaning the same body part cannot be used for
this spell again once it has been activated).
A creature is not detected by the dead man’s tell
item if it is separated from it by 1 foot of stone, 1
inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet
of wood of dirt, or if it is protected by an effect that
prevents divination (such as a nondetection spell).
The same spellcaster cannot have multiple dead
man’s tell items affected with this spell at once.
When you cast the dead man’s tell spell again, any
previous castings of this spell end immediately.

You touch a creature, and it must immediately
make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, one
of its limbs turns into a mindless, hairy spider. On
the target's next turn, the spider twists around and
starts to devour its host. The target then takes 1d6
piercing damage at the start of each of its turns.
Dispel magic can only halt the spell and save the
limb if it is cast before the end of your next turn
after death spider is cast. Otherwise, the spider limb
must be hacked off (15 AC, 40 hp, vulnerable to
slashing damage), which kills the spider. If the
spider is not stopped, it will continue to inflict
damage on its host, consuming it when it reaches 0
hp, and then growing into a giant spider over the
next 24 hours.

Death Talisman
3rd-level necromancy (ritual)
You link your life force to a small item. A knife,
ring, or amulet is typical, but any item can be
chosen. While you remain healthy, the item
remains in perfect shape, never taking and wear or
tear. If it takes damage, it regains hit points
whenever you do, and in the same amount (so, if
you regain 8 hit points, the item also regains 8 hit
points), up to its normal maximum.
If you are killed or suffer the incapacitated,
paralyzed, petrified, stunned, or unconscious
conditions, the talisman becomes rusted and dull.
Once the condition is removed the talisman will
regain its luster. Damaging the item does not harm
you. These effects persist even if you and the item
are not on the same plane. This spell ends if you
cast it again.
“I knew an arcane archer who cast this
spell upon his bow, so as to ensure his

When you cast this spell, an aura of decay
surrounds you. For the duration, whenever a hostile
creature within range takes damage, it must make a
Constitution saving throw. On a failed saving throw,
it suffers a festering wound. This wound inflicts 5
necrotic damage on the creature at the start of each
of its turns.
A creature suffering from a festering wound can
make a new Constitution saving throw at the end of
each of its turns. A successful saving throw stops
the ongoing necrotic damage from that wound and
causes the creature to be immune to the effects of
this spell for 1 minute. A creature can suffer from
only one festering wound at a time.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the amount of
necrotic damage increases by 5 for each slot level

You alter the appearance of an undead creature
with the touch of your hand, masking its undead
nature. You can make the creature appear as it did
in life, or give it the appearance of another race.
However, you can’t change the creature’s general
body type, but you could, for example, make a
zombie or a wight look like a half-elf dressed in fine
clothing. In addition, you can alter its height by one
foot, making it appear taller or shorter, and you can
make it look fat, thin, or anything in between. You
can add small distinctive features to the illusion,
such as a mole on the creature’s face, or a braided
beard. However, the spell doesn’t change the smell,
sound, or tactile features of the undead.
Another creature interacting with the disguised
undead can use an action to make an Intelligence

detect the disguise. The spell masks the disguised
creature from divination spells that detect undead.
To such a divination spell, the creature appears as

spell within the area must make a Constitution
saving throw against your spell save DC, or the spell
fails. Likewise, a spellcaster in the affected area that

must make a Charisma saving throw against your
spellcasting DC whenever it tries to cast a spell with
verbal components, to speak a command word to
activate an item, or to read a scroll, for the spell’s
duration. On a failed save, the creature utters
gibberish instead of the required component,
command word, or scroll wording, and its action is
wasted without producing the desired effect.
In addition, if a creature fails its Wisdom saving
throw, it has disadvantage on all Charisma ability
checks when interacting with other creatures as it
speaks gibberish mixed with its more intelligible
words. The creature can attempt a new saving
throw at the end of each of its turns, and on a

A levitation field surrounds the feet of a creature
you touch. For the duration, the creature hovers
slightly above the ground, leaving no trace of its
passage. The creature’s movement speed and
footing are unaffected by uneven ground, snow, ice,
or similar terrain. However, if the recipient takes

choice from the Tools table found in Chapter 5 of

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Description:
You surround yourself with a thick black shell that
shimmers with dark magic. Until the spell ends, you
gain a +2 bonus to Armor Class and Constitution
saving throws, and whenever a creature ends its
turn within 5 feet of you, it must make a Wisdom
saving throw unless it is immune to the fightened
condition. On a failure, you can push the creature
up to 15 feet away from you, and it is frightened of
you until the end of its next turn. On a success, you

Description:
reduce a creature within 60 feet to 0 hit points with
a weapon attack
You offer an opponent mercy in exchange for its
cooperation. Choose one creature within range that
you have just reduced to 0 hit points with a weapon
attack. You instead reduce that creature to 1 hit
point and immediately command its surrender. It
must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure,
the creature is frightened of you, but rather than
fleeing, the frightened creature stays where it is and
does not move unless you tell it to.
For the duration, the creature (that failed its save)
will not attack you, and it fearfully obeys any
instructions it can hear and understand that will
not directly harm it (for example, it will not
knowingly drink poison or walk off a cliff).
While affected, the creature will not deliberately
say anything to you that it believes to be a lie,
though it can simply remain silent if you do not ask
any direct questions.
Whenever you or one of your allies attempt to
harm the creature, or if you give it instructions that
would harm it or force it to make a saving throw
against another effect, it repeats its Wisdom saving
throw against this spell, ending the spell on a
success. You always know if a creature has
succeeded or failed on a saving throw against this
spell. When the spell’s effect ends, a creature that
never succeeded on any saving throws against this
spell is unaware it was magically influenced,
believing its fear of you was merely natural.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the duration is
increased to 1 hour. If you cast this spell using a
spell slot of 6th level or higher, the duration is
increased to 8 hours.

disguises your cunning readiness to capitalize on
their next move. As part of the action used to cast
this spell, you must make a melee attack with a
weapon against one creature within the spell's
range, otherwise the spell fails. On a hit, the target
suffers the attack's normal effects and takes an
additional 1d10 psychic damage, and until the start
of your next turn, you and the target have
advantage on attack rolls against each other, but
disadvantage on attack rolls against all other
creatures.
In addition, the next time the target attacks you
before the start of your next turn, it provokes
opportunity attacks from you and any other allies of
yours within 5 feet of it.

psychic damage to the target, and you can push the
target up to 5 feet away from you. In addition, the
next time the target makes an attack roll against
you or a creature friendly to you before the end of
its next turn, it takes psychic damage equal to your

You speak five words of a forgotten language of
terrible evil, striking pain in the mind of your target
as the world seems to darken around you. Choose
one target within range. The target takes 10d6
necrotic damage, and you must make a Wisdom
saving throw against your own spellcasting DC. You
take 5d6 necrotic damage on a failed saving throw
or half as much on a successful one. Whether you
succeed or fail, you are lightly obscured by darkness
until the start of your net turn.
The decision to speak the forbidden tongue this
spell requires should not be made lightly.
Besides the immediate danger, it also makes the
caster known to certain eldritch beings whose
notice is best avoided.”

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour
Description:
You call forth the spirit of warrior
who shared your zealous faith in
life and returns now to harry your
foes. The spirit appears in an
unoccupied space you choose
within range and lasts for the
duration or until you cast this
spell again. Creatures of your
choice within 5 feet of the spirit
take a -2 penalty to Armor Class,
and you and creatures and
friendly to you treat the spirit as
an ally for the purposes of traits,
spells, and class features (such as
a rogue's sneak attack). Creatures
hostile to you cannot move
through the spirit's space. When a
creature leaves a space within 5
feet of the spirit, you can use your
reaction to make a melee spell
attack against that creature. On a
hit, the target takes psychic
damage equal to 1d10 + your
spellcasting ability modifier. On a
miss, the target still takes psychic damage equal to
your spellcasting ability modifier.
As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the
warrior up to 30 feet to any unoccupied space.
The spirit shares your race and wears armor of a
past age. Clerics of deities who are associated with a
particular symbol or weapon (such as the black
hand of Bane or the flaming sword of Tempus)
usually conjure a dreadful warrior bearing that
symbol or weapon.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 4th level of or higher, the damage
increases by 1d10 for every two slot levels above 3rd.

spirit ventures into the world. Your spirit is invisible
and has a fly speed of 100’. You can move through
creatures and objects as if they are difficult terrain.
Your spirit cannot be paralyzed, petrified, grappled,
or restrained. You can see and hear as if you were
standing in the same location as your spirit. Your
spirit cannot attack or cast spells; it can just
observe. Creatures and spells that can detect
invisible or ethereal creatures can see your spirit.
When the spell ends, your spirit returns to your
body, and you wake up. If something attacks your
body while your spirit is absent, the spell ends.

your reaction to cast a spell with a casting time of 1
reaction during another creature's turn, you can
cast one more spell of 5th-level or lower that has a
casting time of 1 reaction before the end of that
creature's turn, even though your reaction has
already been used (this is an exception to the rule
that you can only cast one spell of 1st-level or higher
per turn). Spells cast in this way still use spell slots
normally.
In addition, for the duration of this spell, you gain
a +2 bonus on Intelligence (Arcana) checks, and on
all ability checks for your spellcasting ability that do
not already include your proficiency bonus.
“I once encountered a moderately
accomplished wizard with the duel ward
spell in his grimoire, yet he did not have
counterspell inscribed with it. I noted
that without the ability to prepare
counterspell, duel ward was all but

‘but one day soon, I will learn that spell
as well.’ And sure enough, he soon did—I

School: Transmutation
Casting Time: 10 minutes
Range: 10 feet
Components: V, S, M (a feather, and varies)
Duration: Instantaneous
Description:
A glowing feather quill appears in the air. You can
make the quill copy any writing, script, or runes
that you can see within range onto another suitable
surface that you can see within range. The original
writing remains intact after the duplicate is made.
This spell will make an exact copy of magical
writing without error, such as that from a scroll,
glyph, or a spell from a spell book.
Only a feather is needed as the material
component to copy nonmagical writing from one
source onto another. However, the spellcaster will
need a piece of parchment, a book page, or another
suitable object to duplicate spell scrolls in addition
to the necessary spell components, which are
consumed by the spell in the process. A glyph,
runes, or writing can be copied onto stone, wood, or
another suitable surface, but might not be mobile or
easily carried in many circumstances.
This spell can only duplicate 1st level spell scrolls
(see exception below). In addition, you can’t use a
spell focus to substitute for the components when
copying scrolls.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using
a higher-level spell slot than 4th level, you can copy
a spell scroll one level higher for every two slot
levels above 4th. For example, you could copy a 2nd
level spell scroll with a 6th level spell slot, or a 3rd
level spell scroll with an 8th level slot.

poison damage on a failed save, or half as much
damage on a successful one. If this reduces its hit
points to 0, it dies.
This poison cannot be detected by non-magical
means. Victims of this spell are left with a residue of
dust around their mouths.

With one stern, commanding word, you gesture to a
point on the ground within range, and the indicated
spot erupts in a shower of rock, dirt, and fire. Each
creature in a 20-foot radius sphere centered on that
point takes 5d6 fire damage and must make a
Dexterity saving throw. A target that fails the saving
throw is knocked prone and takes additional
bludgeoning damage equal to the fire damage. The
fire also ignites flammable objects in the area that
aren't being worn or carried.
After the spell ends, the area of the spell becomes
difficult terrain until it is cleared. Each 5-foot-
square portion of the area requires at least 1 minute
to clear by hand.
Earth-based or fire-based elemental creatures do

duration of the spell, the creature has resistance to
damage from creatures or objects made of any kind
of earth (including stone, dust, soil, clay, or
elemental earth), and from earth-based spells and
magical effects. This includes falling rocks, falling
damage from impacting against any kind of earth,
attacks by earth-based creatures (such as clay or
stone golems, gargoyles, earth elementals). Acid
damage and damage from metal objects or creatures
are not considered earth-based for purposes of this

perceptible wisps of shadow which amplify doubts
and fears. Choose a point within range. Each

Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 30 feet
Components: V
Duration: 1 round
Description:
As part of the action used to cast this spell, you
must make an unarmed strike or weapon attack
against one creature within range. On a hit, the
target suffers the attack's normal effects, and if the
target is concentrating on a spell when this attack
hits, the attack deals extra thunder damage equal to
your spellcasting ability modifier, which creates a
loud noise that can be heard up to 100 feet away. In
addition, if this attack causes the target to make a
Constitution saving throw to maintain
concentration on a spell, that saving throw is made
with disadvantage.
This spell's damage increases when you reach
higher levels. At 5th level, the melee attack deals an
extra 1d6 thunder damage to the target (whether or
not it is concentrating on a spell). This extra
damage increases to 2d6 at 11th level and 3d6 at 17th

You select a creature within range, and nine small
silvery orbs spring into being, hovering around the
creature and granting it strong magical protection.
As an action on your turn, you can transfer the orbs
(and their protection) to another recipient within
range.
When a spell forces the protected creature to
make a saving throw, or when the creature is
targeted by a spell attack, it can expend one of the
orbs to nullify the spell's effect on it. The protected
creature no longer needs to make a saving throw, or
the spell attack is absorbed. Afterwards, the orb that
blocked the attack fades away.
This spell only protects the creature you chose
with the orbs hovering around it. Other targets
caught in a spell's area are affected normally.

You teleport yourself up to 30 feet to an unoccupied
space that you can see. You can bring along objects
as long as their weight doesn't exceed what you can
carry.
If you wish, you can also take one creature with
you when you cast this spell, provided that creature
is within 5 feet of you, it is Medium or smaller, and
it is not carrying gear in excess of its carrying
capacity.
When you take a creature with you, each of you
is teleported to an unoccupied space of your choice
within 30 feet. Your new space and that of the
creature you take with you must be within 5 feet of
each other. If either of you would arrive in a place
already occupied by an object or a creature, the
spell fails to teleport either of you.
If the other creature is not willing to be
teleported, it must roll a Charisma saving throw. On
a success, it is not teleported. A creature has
advantage on this saving throw if it can see you,
unless you are in combat with it and it has not yet
taken a turn.
When you use this spell to teleport another
creature, a loud popping sound emanates from that
creature's location when you first cast the spell,
followed by another loud popping sound that
emanates from the creature's new location when it
arrives. Both times, the sound is audible out to 100

Description:
A moment of battlefield success grants you a
magical epiphany, allowing you to place a combat
enchantment on your weapon. As part of the action
used to cast this spell, you must make a melee
attack with a weapon against one creature within
the spell's range, otherwise the spell fails. On a hit,
the target suffers the attack's normal effects, and
you draw chronomantic magic energy from the
target's place in time to enchant your weapon. For
the duration, the speed of the target you hit is
reduced by half, you have advantage on melee spell
attacks against the target, and you can use the
melee weapon you attacked with as a spellcasting
focus for any spell you cast. Whether you hit or
miss, until the spell ends, the weapon gains a +1
bonus to its attack and damage rolls, unless it is a
magic weapon that already has a bonus to those
rolls.
At Higher Levels. When you use a spell slot of

Elemental Blade
=== SPELL END ===

=== SPELL START ===
Name: Elemental Blade
Level: 2
School: Evocation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M (a plum blossom)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Description:
When you cast this spell, a blade of elemental
energy appears in the hand of a willing creature you
touch. You choose one of the following damage
types when you cast this spell: acid, cold, fire,
lightning, or poison. The elemental blade is the size
and shape of a normal shortsword, but is virtually
weightless. If the wielder lets go of the blade, it
disappears, but until the spell ends, you can evoke it
for the creature again as a bonus action.
The blade sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius
and dim light for an additional 10 feet, and the
wielder can use its action to make a melee attack
with the blade, rolling the attack as if it were
attacking with a regular shortsword. On a hit, the
target takes 2d4 plus your spellcasting ability
modifier damage of the type chosen when this spell
was first cast. Since the blade is immaterial, the
wielder’s Strength or Dexterity modifiers do not
apply to the damage, nor does any extra damage
from special abilities the wielder may possess (such
as sneak attack).
A creature who takes damage from this spell suffers
an additional effect depending on the type of
damage inflicted, as follows:
 Acid. The creature suffers disadvantage on the
next Constitution saving throw it makes before
the start of its next turn (this includes a saving
throw to maintain concentration on a spell
which may be caused by this spell’s damage).
 Cold. Until the end of the creature’s next turn,
its speed is reduced by half and it cannot take
reactions.
 Fire. The creature must immediately choose to
either fall prone to extinguish flames on its body
or be ignited, taking 1d4 fire damage at the end
of each of its turns until it or another creature
within 5 feet takes an action to extinguish the
flames. Creatures wearing metal armor are
immune to this effect.
 Lightning. The creature can’t take reactions
until the start of its next turn and it takes an
extra 1d4 lightning damage if it is wearing metal
armor.
 Poison. The creature is poisoned until the end
of its next turn.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using
a 4th level or higher spell slot, the damage on a hit
increases by ld4 for every two slot levels above 2nd.

from a plane other than where the spell is cast)
When you cast this spell, it transforms your body
and all the gear you are carrying into a new form,
composed of your choice of one of the following
elements: air, earth, fire, or water. You retain your
previous size and statistics, except as noted below,
but until the spell ends, your creature type becomes
elemental, and you gain the following benefits:
 You are attuned to the environments where this
element completely surrounds you, breathing
and existing in such places comfortably.
 You are immune to poison damage and the
poisoned condition, and to the paralyzed,
stunned, and unconscious conditions.
 You gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing,
and slashing damage from non-magical
weapons.
In addition, you gain the following special abilities
depending on the elemental type you chose:
Air. You can fly at your normal speed. Creatures
have disadvantage on their attack rolls against you
while they are flying or hovering.
Earth. You gain a +1 bonus on attack rolls against
foes that are touching the ground and advantage on
any ability check you make to shove a creature. No
matter what armor you wear, your Armor Class
cannot be lower than 13 + your Dexterity modifier.
Fire. You are immune to fire. Any creature that
grapples you, or is within 5 feet of you when it hits
you with an attack roll, takes 1d6 fire damage. When
you hit with an unarmed strike, you inflict an extra
1d6 fire damage.
Water. You can swim at your normal speed. You
gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls if you
and your opponent are both touching water. You
can use your action to put any nonmagical fire
within 5 feet of you, or to put out any magical fire
within 5 feet of you as if casting dispel magic as a
7th-level spell.
Elemental Burst
=== SPELL END ===

=== SPELL START ===
Name: Elemental Burst
Level: 1
School: Evocation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 30 feet
Components: V, S, M (varies, see description)
Duration: Instantaneous
Description:
You release the magical energy from one of the
elements in an explosive burst. The material
component of this spell depends on the element:
burning incense for air, soft clay for earth, sulphur
and phosphorus for fire, water and sand for water,
or any kind of vegetable matter for wood.
When you cast this spell, you choose a point
within range that contains one of the following five
elements of your choice: air, earth (which includes
soil, metal, or stone), fire, water, or wood. That
material releases its elemental energy. Each creature
within a 15-foot cone emanating from that point
must make a saving throw. The victim takes 2d6
damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on
a successful one.
The type of saving throw required and damage
inflicted depend on the element, as determined by
the following table:
In addition to taking damage, each creature that
fails its saving throw suffers an additional effect,
depending on the element type. These effects are
detailed below, along with descriptions of each
element’s exact effect:
Air. There is a sudden flash of light and peal of
thunder as a gust of wind whips up out of nowhere,
heavy with static electricity that shocks those
nearby. Creatures that fail their save are knocked
prone. Objects that aren’t being worn or carried
become electrified, inflicting 1d6 lightning damage
on the next person who touches them within the
next minute.
Earth. Clumps of metal and rock spray out,
oozing a corrosive substance. Creatures who fail
their save are pushed back 10 feet away from the
point at the center of the effect, as are objects
weighing less than 100 lbs. that aren’t being worn or
carried.
Fire. The fire shoots out glowing sparks. It ignites
flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn
or carried, and creatures who fail their save take an
additional 1d6 damage at the beginning of their next
turn.
Water. Icy water pushes out in a freezing wave
that crashes into those nearby. Creatures who fail
their save reduce their speed by half until the end of
their next turn, and objects weighing less than 100
pounds that aren’t being worn or carried are pushed
back 15 feet away from the point at the center of the
effect.
Wood. The element throws off sharp slivers of
the same material as itself, infused with a poisonous
sap. Creatures who fail their save cannot take
reactions until the end of their next turn. Against
objects, this effect inflicts piercing damage instead
of poison.
The explosive noise of this spell can be heard up
to 100 feet away. The spell does not noticeably affect
the structure of any object that is the source of the
elemental effect, unless it is an object that is not
being worn or carried. If that is the case, the object
suffers the same 2d6 damage as a creature that
failed its saving throw.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using
a 2nd level or higher spell slot, the damage
increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.
“This is one of many extremely useful
spells that originated among the
spellcasters of the continent of Kara-
Tur, where sages identify five elements
instead of four. Unfortunately, the
mages of that land are far better than
those of Faerûn at keeping their secrets...
So good, in fact, that I know the ways of
spellcasters on distant planes better
than I know those native to the continent
that adjoins my own! To this day, it be
unclear to me whether the creator was a
member of the mystic order known as the
wu-jen, or one of the divinely inspired
sorcerers called the shugenja.”

Description:
The target of this spell becomes very physically
beautiful, with a subtle glow surrounding it in
shadows, and tiny motes of light clinging to it in
sunlight. The target gains advantage on all
Charisma checks until the spelle ends.
“This effect is very similar to that of spells such
as charm person, but Elonia Starre—that skilled
illusionist of Raven’s Bluff, as well-known for
her prowess as a businesswoman and
beautician as for her magic—cleverly crafted a
spell that locates the enchantment in the caster,
rather than in those the caster seeks to charm.
As a result, this spell bypasses many natural
resistances and immunities, and does not
violate the sanctity of any creature’s mind.”

Embalming Touch
2nd-level necromancy (ritual)
You preserve one corpse against the ravages of time.

Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 minute
Description:
This spell incites and enrages animals, making them
hostile and vicious. Roll 6d10; the total is how many
hit points of creatures this spell can affect. Eligible
beasts within 30 feet of a point you choose within
range are affected in ascending order of their
current hit points (ignoring unconscious creatures,
non-beasts, or beasts with an Intelligence score of 4
or higher, who are unaffected).
Starting with the creature that has the lowest
current hit points, each creature affected by this
spell enters a terrible rage for the duration. Subtract
each creatures’ hit points from the total before
moving on to the creature with the next lowest hit
points. A creature’s hit points must be equal to or
less than the remaining total for that creature to be
affected.
A beast that is magically bound to a master or
trained only to attack on order is allowed a Wisdom
saving throw against this effect; other beasts are
not. Creatures who succeed on their saving throws
are still deducted from the total number of hit
points of creatures you can affect.
At the beginning of its turn, an affected creature
must make a melee attack against a creature within
reach. If a beast affected by this spell has no
creatures within reach, it will move towards the
nearest creature and attack. If it cannot do so for
some reason, the beast attacks an object within
range, which may be the ground or a wall.
The first two attacks by beasts enraged by this
spell are made with advantage.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, roll an additional
2d10 for each slot level above 1st. When you cast it
with a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can also
affect abominations, celestials, fey, and fiends that
have assumed an animal form (such as familiars).

Description:
When you cast this spell, it creates a spherical
storm with hurricane force winds that whip
violently around you in a 40-foot radius sphere
centered on you. However, within a 10-foot radius
sphere also centered on you, these winds are
relatively calm, merely a strong breeze.
Because of the winds, creatures within 40 feet of
you cannot make ranged attack rolls, nor can they
be the targets of ranged attacks. Certain large
projectiles, such as thrown or catapulted boulders,
can be used to attack despite the winds, but even
attacks with such weapons are made at
disadvantage.
Any creature that moves into the area of the
violent winds or starts its turn there must make a
Strength saving throw. If they fail, they suffer one of
the following effects, depending on their size and
whether they are flying.
 Medium and smaller creatures are moved 1d4 x
10 feet in a random direction, knocked prone,
and take 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage for
every 10 feet this effect moves them.
 Medium flying creatures are pushed back 1d6 x
10 feet.
 Large creatures are knocked prone.
 Large flying creatures are pushed 1d6 x 5 feet.
 Huge creatures make no progress through the
winds.
 Huge flying creatures are pushed 1d4 x 5 feet.
You can move at half your movement speed while
concentrating on the storm, and it moves with you.
However, if your movement causes the storm’s
winds to cross into a space occupied by another
creature, the creature must make a Strength saving
throw to avoid the spell’s effects.

20 feet in diameter. If you choose an object, that
object must remain in its place; if the object is
moved more than 20 feet from where you cast this
spell, the spell ends without being triggered.
You decide what triggers the trap when you cast
the spell. For fang traps placed on a surface, most
typical triggers include touching or standing on the
trapped surface, removing another object covering
the surface, or approaching within a certain
distance of the surface area. For fang traps inscribed
within an object, the most common triggers include
opening that object, approaching within a certain
distance of the object, or manipulating the object in
a pre-described way. Once a fang trap is triggered,
this spell ends.
You can further refine the trigger so the spell
activates only under certain circumstances or
according to physical characteristics (such as height
or weight), creature kind (for example, the ward
could be set to affect aberrations or drow), or
according to whether or not the creature has
immunity to poison damage or the poisoned
condition. Unlike a glyph of warding, it can’t be
made to activate on the basis of alignment. You can
also set conditions for creatures that don’t trigger
the fang trap, such as those who say a certain
password. You are unable to trigger the fang trap
yourself.
Any creature that sees you cast this spell knows
the exact area affected, and immediately makes an
Intelligence (Arcana) check against your spell save
DC, gaining advantage on that check. If the creature
succeeds, it also knows what triggers the trap.
Otherwise, the fang trap’s presence is almost
undetectable and requires a successful Intelligence
(Investigation) check against your spell save DC to
be noticed.
When the fang trap discharges, the object or
surface grows huge fangs that immobilize the
creature who triggered it. The creature is restrained
until the beginning of its next turn. At the
beginning of its next turn, it must make a
Constitution saving throw. If it succeeds, it is no
longer restrained. If it fails, it takes 2d8 piercing
damage, 2d8 poison damage, and 2d8 psychic
damage, and remains restrained for 1 minute.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the psychic
damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above
4th.

You draw on magic of the Feywild to quickly
teleport in order to punish an enemy who ignores
you. When you use your reaction to cast this spell,
you can teleport up to 10 feet to any unoccupied
space where the triggering creature would be within

weapon attack against the triggering creature. The

The damage of attacks you make with this spell
increases when you reach higher levels. At 5th level,
the melee attack deals an extra 1d4 radiant damage
to the target. This extra radiant damage increases to
2d4 at 11th level and 3d4 at 17th level. Whenever you
add this radiant damage to the damage of your
weapon attack, the maximum amount of damage
the attack can inflict is equal to the amount of
radiant damage + your spellcasting ability modifier.
“Magic of the Feywild is notoriously untrustworthy, but the
eladrin who created this defensive spell knew their craft. It
efficiently draws energy from their home plane and enables
consistent, limited teleportation in battle, while requiring no
more than a neophyte’s level of magical power.”

You touch your target and run your hands across
its skin, causing strips of flesh to peel away from its
body. Once this effect has started, only you or dispel
magic can stop it. When you first cast this spell, the
target must make a Constitution saving throw. A
creature who fails its saving throw takes 2d6
slashing damage, and its Charisma score is reduced
by 1. If the save is successful, the creature takes half
the damage, and its Charisma is unaffected.
On each of your turns for the spell’s duration,
you can use a bonus action to further mutilate your
target, and the effects increase each time you do so,
as follows:
First bonus action. The target must make a
Constitution saving throw. If it fails, it takes 4d6
slashing damage, and its Charisma score is reduced
by 1d4. If it succeeds, it takes half as much slashing
damage, and its Charisma is unaffected.
Second bonus action. The target must make a
Constitution saving throw. If it fails, it takes 6d6
slashing damage, and its Charisma score is reduced
by 2d4. If it succeeds, it takes half as much slashing
damage, and its Charisma is unaffected.
Third bonus action. The target must make a
Constitution saving throw. If it fails, it takes 8d6
slashing damage, and its Charisma score is reduced
by 2d4. If it succeeds, it takes half as much slashing
damage, and its Charisma is unaffected. Half of the
reduction in Charisma from failing this last saving
throw is permanent.
If a target’s hit points are reduced to 0 by this
spell, the target immediately dies as the flesh is
ripped away from its bones. The target’s Charisma
cannot drop below 1.
The slashing damage can be healed normally. The
reduction to Charisma can be healed by the
regenerate spell, by the wish spell, or by resting for
48 hours after the hit point damage has been
healed, except for any permanent reduction, which
cannot be healed by anything short of a wish.

frustrations, depending on how ye view
it—is that no matter how many centuries
of intense study ye devote, some mysteries
yet beckon.
“For me, I think the relationship of the
mystical force known as ki to magic shall
ever be such. Like a bird that flits away
whenever ye come close, whenever I think
the answer is within my grasp, it vanishes
in the face of some new wrinkle or
contradiction.
“In certain nations of Kara-Tur, where
an advanced study of ki is made, a battle
cry like the one this cantrip creates is
often called a kiai, and is considered an
achievement of martial skill, rather than
true magic. Perhaps this cantrip was
created to emulate such displays?"

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Description:
As part of the action used to cast this spell, you
must make a melee attack with a weapon against a
creature within range, otherwise the spell fails. On a
miss, the spell ends. On a hit, the target suffers the
attack's normal effects, and the air shimmers
around you as an illusory duplicate of you appears
in an unoccupied space of your choice within 5 feet
of the target. If no such space exists, the spell fails.
Until the spell ends, the duplicate persists,
appearing to be a living, breathing, active version of
you. If the target ends its turn more than 60 feet
away from the duplicate, or if you end your turn
more than 60 feet away from the duplicate, the spell
ends. The duplicate mimics your actions to a
degree, but no matter where you are, it seeks to
remain close to the target.
If the target ends its turn more than 5 feet away
from the duplicate, the duplicate moves up to 60
feet to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the
target. If no such space exists, the duplicate moves
to the unoccupied space closest to the target.
While the duplicate is within 5 feet of the target,
you can make melee attacks against the target as if
it were within 5 feet of you, just as if you were
attacking from the space the duplicate is occupying.
If you hit the target with a melee attack roll while it
is within 5 feet of
the duplicate,
the attack inflicts
additional
psychic damage
equal to 1d6 +
your spellcasting
ability modifier.
While you are
within 5 feet of
your duplicate,
whenever an
attack roll is
made against
you, you can use
your reaction to
roll a d20. If you
roll an 11 or
higher on the
die, the attack
targets the
duplicate instead
of you.
The duplicate’s
AC equals your
spellcasting DC. If an attack hits a duplicate, the
duplicate is destroyed. A duplicate can be destroyed
only by an attack that hits it. It ignores all other
damage and effects. If the duplicate is destroyed,
the spell ends.

You summon the strength and horrific majesty of a
terrifying princess of the Nine Hells to wreak havoc
upon your enemies. As part of the action used to
cast this spell, you can move up to 30 feet. For each
5 feet you move, you can choose one creature
within 5 feet that you haven’t yet attacked as a part
of this spell, and make a melee spell attack against
that creature. On a hit, the target takes 8d6 necrotic
damage, and you push it 5 feet away from you.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 8th level or higher, the number of feet
you move as part of this spell is increased by 10 feet
for each slot level above 7th.
“This spell is, of course, named for the
archdevil Glasya, duchess of the Sixth, a
Princess of the Nine Hells, the daughter
of Asmodeus, and—like all her kind—a
terrible host. It is said she first granted
this spell to a warlock who served her via
an infernal pact. Since that time, it has
been adapted for the use of all warlocks,
whether their pact is merely reckless
(such as taking on one of the Summer Fey
monarchs as a patron) or self-
destructively foolish (such as bartering
for power with one of the mad entities of
the Far Realm).
“Despite its widespread use, most
warlocks still prefer to avoid this spell
for its diabolical associations—those
warlocks who have a pact with her being
notable exceptions.”

This spell permanently reinforces the strength and
durability of materials. Paper is much harder to
tear, wood is more durable, and glass is harder to
break.
You can touch and affect up to 50 cubic feet of
material each time you cast this spell. The material
becomes resilient if it was fragile, and its AC is
increased by 4. If a material is already resilient, it
doubles in hit points.
For example, if you touch a resilient section of
wooden wall that has 50 hit points, its AC would
improve from 15 to 19, and it would have 100 hit
points.

Description:
Make a melee spell attack against a
creature within 5 feet of you. On a
hit, the target takes 12d10 cold
damage. If the creature is killed
by this spell, it is petrified as
solid ice; if it is broken
while petrified this way,
the creature thaws to its
original state but suffers
whatever trauma or loss
of limbs that occurred
while it was frozen.
At Higher Levels.
When you cast this
spell using a spell slot of
8th level or higher, the
cold damage increases by
1d10 for every slot level
above 7th.
Heart of
Stone
8th-level necromancy (ritual)
(an exquisitely carved
stone heart made of jade, obsidian,
or gold-veined marble worth at least 5,000 gp)
When this spell is cast, your heart is replaced with
an ornately crafted stone heart. For the spell’s
duration, your living heart is stored in a special
alchemical solution at a hidden location, which you
have either prepared and chosen previously, or
which you choose during the casting of this spell
from among locations you have been to in the last
24 hours.
The stone heart grants you resistance to cold, fire,
and lightning damage, as well as resistance to
damage from bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing
weapons.
However, the stone heart also has the following
disadvantages:
 You can only gain a maximum of 1 hit
point per hit die when you heal naturally.
 You instantly die if your living
heart is damaged or destroyed.
 A creature that can see the location
of your heart or is close enough to
hear it beating can find it, but only
if they are actively searching for it.
The DC for ability checks to find
your heart is equal to your
spellcasting DC.
In addition, the heart of stone
can be dispelled, which transfers
your living heart back to your
body, and sends your stone heart
to your living heart's previous
hiding place. If you enter an anti-
magic field, your stone heart and
living heart temporarily switch
places, and then switch back again
after you leave the affected area.

shoulder, and it sheds dim light in a 20-foot radius.
The first time that a spell that targets you either
forces you to make a saving throw or targets you
with a spell attack, roll 1d4 + 5. If the number rolled
equals or exceeds the level of the spell, that spell
fails to affect you, and is turned back upon its
caster. If that spell required a saving throw, its
caster is now the one who must make the saving
throw against your spellcasting DC; if it was
targeting you with a spell attack, the caster is now
the target of that spell attack using your spell attack
bonus.
For the spell’s duration, each additional time a
spell that targets you either forces you to make a
saving throw or targets you with a spell attack,
repeat the process as above but subtract the level of
any spells previously turned from the result’s total.
If the total still equals or exceeds the level of the
spell, it is turned back on its caster as described
above. If the total is greater than 1 but less than the
level of the spell targeting you, then the holy star
remains, and you are affected by the targeting spell
as normal. However, if the total is reduced to 0 or
below, you are affected by the targeting spell as
normal and this spell immediately ends.
While the holy star remains, you can use your
action on each of your turns to launch a fire bolt (as

it can act normally.

1,500 gp, which is consumed in the casting)
You counter an opponent's spell before it is even
cast, without knowing what spell you are
countering. When you cast this spell, the target
loses the ability to cast the highest-level spell it
knows (or has prepared, if it prepares spells) for the
duration. If the creature knows (or has prepared)
multiple spells of that level, the DM randomly
determines one of those spells. Until the spell ends,
the target cannot cast that spell by any means.
In addition, if the target uses spell slots to cast
spells, it loses one spell slot instantly when you cast
this spell. The lost spell slot is of the highest level
for which the creature currently has slots. After this
spell ends, the spell slot is regained.
If the target has 9th-level spell slots, or the spell it
would lose the ability to cast is 9th-level, make an
ability check using your spellcasting ability. The DC
equals 10 + the spell’s level. On a success, this spell
works normally. On a failure, the target can make
an Intelligence saving throw to negate the effects of
this spell entirely.
This spell has no effect on creatures that cannot
cast spells.
“Khelben Arunsun, the first Blackstaff of Waterdeep, created
many spells, yet only a handful bear his name Now deceased,
Khelben was one of the most powerful wizards of Faerûn, or
any other world for that matter.
“A shocking number of his plane’s powerful mages perished
in its past century of magical chaos, Khelben among them.
Given his power and influence, it is hard for me to credit the
small number of spell’s bearing his name to humility.
“I note that neither Khelben’s close friend Elminster nor the
love of his life Laeral have commented on this matter here. Nor
did either leave a note on
Alamanther’s return, a spell
created by Alamanther of Aglarond, who was once a consort of
the Simbul, the Witch-Queen of Aglarond, before being slain
in battle with the Red Wizards of Thay.
“As the Simbul was Laeral’s sister, and Elminster’s lover,
this is another situation where both of my fellow commentators
must have personal insights that could be of great scholarly
interest. I cannot fathom the reason for their silence.”

Laeral's Crowning Touch

You magically inscribe a glowing symbol of Mystra,
goddess of magic, on a creature, cursing it with that
goddess's fury. The target must make a Wisdom
saving throw. Creatures that cast spells as a bard,
sorcerer, warlock, or wizard (including arcane
tricksters and eldritch knights) make this saving
throw at disadvantage. On a failure, until the spell
ends, the target has disadvantage on all Intelligence,
Wisdom, and Charisma checks, all spell attack rolls,
and all saving throws against spells. For the same
duration, all saving throws against spells cast by the
target are made at advantage, and the symbol you
inscribed on the target sheds dim light in a 5-foot
radius around it.
While a target is under the effects of this spell,
each time it casts a spell of 1st-level or higher, it
must make a Constitution saving throw. On a
failure, it takes damage equal to twice the spell's
level. Whenever a creature with hair takes this
damage, streaks of silver appear in its hair. If this
damage reduces it to 0 hit points, the target's hair
becomes completely silver.
The inscribed symbol of Mystra appears drawn in
silver on each palm (or on the chest and forehead of
beings lacking palms).
This spell cannot be dispelled by any other spell
except for wish, but it can be countered by
counterspell. When this spell ends, all of its effects
end as well, except for any changes to the target's
hair, which remain permanently as if they were the
target's natural hair color.
“Our goddess Mystra inspired me to research
this spell, intended only for use against beings
who misuse arcane magic, which is granted by
Mystra via the Weave. The Lady of Mysteries
does not look kindly on mages who hurl deadly
magic at every spellcaster who insults them,
nor those who use the Art to deceive or exert
baleful influence over others.
“Mystra has been known to shorten the
effects on the truly repentant and the
undeserving, if they pray to her for forgiveness
and obtain the willing spiritual guidance of a
cleric of Mystra.”

Range: touch
Components: V, S, M (a stoppered bottle)
Duration: 1 hour
Description:
You fill the bottle with water, and you enchant it to
become crystal clear. Anyone who drinks the water
during the duration is treated as if they were the
target of a lesser restoration. The side effect is what
gives the spell its name. Anyone that drinks the
potion must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 15)
or find everything hysterically funny. The character
becomes prone and incapacitated for one round,
laughing so loudly it is audible out to 50 feet.

Components: V, S (a piece of ammunition)
Duration: Instantaneous
Description:
You touch a piece of ammunition and instantly
make a weapon attack with it, just as if you were
attacking with a weapon that is normally used to
fire that type of ammunition. If multiple weapons
use that type of ammunition, you choose which of
those weapons this attack emulates. This attack is
made exactly as if you were using the weapon
emulated. The cantrip does not confer any other
benefits beyond those stated above (such as weapon
proficiency).
At Higher Levels. This spell's damage increases
when you reach higher levels. At 5th level, if the
attack hits, it deals an extra 1d4 force damage to the
target. This extra damage increases to 2d4 at 11th

Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 90 feet
Components: V, S, M (a bottle carved of obsidian)
Duration: Concentration, 1 minute
Description:
Choose a point you can see on the ground within
range. A fountain of liquid hot magma erupts in a
20-foot sphere centered on that point. For the
duration, the area of the spell (including all
portions of that area, above the ground or beneath
it) becomes difficult terrain, and the lava ignites
flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn
or carried.
A creature takes 3d6 bludgeoning damage and
3d6 fire damage when it enters the spell’s area for
the first time on a turn or starts its turn there.
After the spell ends, the area of the spell remains
difficult terrain until it is cleared. Each 5-foot-
square portion of the area requires at least 1 minute
to clear by hand.
Firenewts or earth-based or fire-based elemental
creatures (such as gargoyles or salamanders) do not
take damage from this spell. Instead, such a
creature is healed, regaining hit points equal to half
the fire damage inflicted. Only firenewts or
creatures of the elemental type can benefit from
this effect.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the bludgeoning
damage and fire damage each increase by 1d6 for
each level above 4th.
Lava Missile

Name: Lava Missile
Level: 2
School: Conjuration

Range: 90 Feet
Components: V, S, M (any object made of glass)
Duration: Instantaneous
Description:
You conjure handfuls of liquid-hot stone from the
elemental planes and hurl them at foes with
unerring accuracy. You create four lava missiles,
each of which hits a target of your choice that you
can see within range. Make a ranged spell attack. If
you hit a lava missile deals 1d6 fire damage and 1d6
bludgeoning damage to its target. The darts all
strike simultaneously, and you can direct them to
hit one creature or several. The darts can also target
objects that are not being worn or carried, and
ignites them if they are flammable.
If a lava missile strikes a firenewt or an earth-
based or fire-based elemental creature (such as a
gargoyle or salamander), it does not inflict
damage on the creature. Instead, that creature is
healed, regaining 1d4 hit points for each lava missile
that hits. Only firenewts or creatures of the
elemental type can benefit from this effect.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the spell creates
one more dart for each slot level above 2nd.

You conjure a wave of burning lava that rises up and
showers an area within range. The affected area is a
30-foot cone originating from a point you choose
within range. Each creature in that area must make
a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a creature
takes 3d6 bludgeoning damage and 3d6 fire
damage, and its speed is reduced by half until the
end of its next turn.
The area of the spell becomes difficult terrain,
and the lava ignites flammable objects in the area
that aren't being worn or carried. The difficult
terrain cannot be cleared for 1 minute, after which
the lava cools. Each 5-foot-square portion of the
area requires at least 1 minute to clear by hand.
Firenewts or
earth-based or fire-
based elemental
creatures (such as
gargoyles or
salamanders) do
not take damage

=== SPELL START ===
Name: Leading Strike
Level: cantrip
School: Enchantment
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 5 feet
Components: V, M (a weapon)
Duration: Instantaneous
Description:
As part of the action used to cast this spell, you
must make a melee attack with a weapon against a
creature within range, otherwise the spell fails. On a
hit, the target suffers the attack's normal effects,
and your enchanted strike shows an ally of your
choice within 5 feet of either you or the target how
to hit your foe where it hurts. That ally has
advantage on the next attack roll it makes against
the target before the start of your next turn. If that
attack hits, it inflicts an extra 1d6 radiant damage
and the spell ends.
This spell's damage increases when you reach
higher levels. At 5th level, your melee attack deals
an extra 1d6 radiant damage to the target, and the
extra radiant damage from an ally’s strike increases
to 2d6. Both damage rolls increase by 1d6 at 11th

=== SPELL START ===
Name: Leomund’s Trap
Level: 2
School: Illusion
Casting Time: 1 minute
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M (a piece of iron pyrite)
Duration: Instantaneous
Description:
This spell is cast on a device, such as a chest or door
lock. To a creature trained in thieves’ tools, the
object appears to be trapped with a complex
mechanism that would be difficult to disarm. The
main purpose of the spell is to deter would-be
thieves.
A creature trained in thieves’ tools and proficient
with the Investigation skill can spend an action to
make an Intelligence (Investigation) check with
disadvantage against your spellcasting DC. On a
successful check, the creature detects the ruse, and
can bypass the illusion to deal with the real device.
However, if the check is failed, all attempts to
disable the device fail, even though the “trap”
somehow doesn’t activate.
Lesser Acupuncture
=== SPELL END ===

=== SPELL START ===
Name: Lesser Acupuncture
Level: cantrip
School: Necromancy
Casting Time: 1 minute
Range: Touch
Components: S, M (acupuncturist’s needles)
Duration: Instantaneous
Description:
Inserting needles into precise centers of ki in the
body, you energize a creature’s natural healing
abilities. The creature may spend 1 Hit Die, and it it
can roll 1d4 and add the result to any Constitution
saving throws it makes before the end of its next
turn. Once a creature benefits from this cantrip, it
cannot benefit from it again until it finishes a short
or long rest.
As you gain levels, the number of Hit Dice the
affected creature can spend increases. When you
reach 5th level, the creature can spend up to 2 Hit
Dice, at 11th level it can spend up to 3, and at 17th
level it can spend up to 4. This spell has no effect on
undead or constructs.
Lesser Chainfire

Name: Lesser Chainfire
Level: 5
School: Enchantment
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: S
Duration: 1 minute
Description:
A column of magical fire and light descends on your
enemy, then spreads out to not only burn other foes
physically, but burn away their ties to the ally you
targeted. Make a ranged spell attack against one
creature within range. On a hit, the target takes 3d8
radiant damage.
Whether the attack hits or misses, a column of
psychic fire consumes it and the creatures around it.
Each creature of your choice in a 10-foot-radius, 40-
foot-high cylinder centered on the target (including
the target) must make a Wisdom saving throw. A
creature takes 2d6 fire damage and 2d6 psychic
damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on
a successful one.
In addition, each creature besides the target who
fails the Wisdom saving throw becomes indifferent
towards the target and forgets the target ever
existed, as if its memories were altered by a modify
memory spell. This effect lasts for 1 minute. During
that time, the creatures take no action to cooperate
with the target and make no special effort to keep it
from harm. If it is in a position of authority, affected
creatures do not obey its orders. When the effect
ends, all affected creatures regain their normal
memories.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the psychic
damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above
5th.
“There is said to exist a greater chainfire
spell, which can erase all memory of the
target from existence. If this spell did
once exist, it is now apparently
forgotten.”
—Elminster
“Heartened to see that my dear friend
Elminster chose not to make a joke here,
instead letting the irony speak for itself.
Perhaps, after a thousand years of life, even
archmages such as ourselves can still grow and
mature. Perhaps…”

Name: Lesser Fabricate
Level: 2
School: Transmutation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 50 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour
Description:
You convert raw materials into products of the same
material. For example, you could fabricate an oar
from a wooden limb, or a shirt from a clump of
wool.
Choose raw materials that you can see within
range. You can fabricate a Medium or smaller object
(contained within a 5-foot cube, or eight connected
2.5 -foot cubes), given sufficient quantity of raw
material. If you are working with metal, stone or
another mineral substance, however, the fabricated
object can be no larger than Small (contained
within a single 2.5-foot cube). The quality of objects
created by this spell is commensurate with the
quality of the raw materials.
Creatures or magic items can’t be created by this
spell. You also can’t use it to create items that
require a high degree of craftmanship, such as
jewelry, weapons, glass, or armor, unless you have
proficiency with the type of artisan’s tools used to
craft such objects.
Lesser Guardian Seal
4th-level abjuration (ritual)
You target a closable object (a door, window, box
etc.) and name one creature type. Any creature of
that type cannot open that object. The creature also
cannot damage the object, nor attempt to pick or
break the lock. If another creature tries to break the
lock or damage the object, the object also becomes
resistant to all damage and the DC to break the
object increases by 10. Casting knock on the object
suppresses lesser guardian seal for 1 minute.

The person touched is immune to nonmagical metal
for the duration of the spell. Metal items pass
through you, and cause no harm. You can also walk
through metal barriers, such as gates or bars.
Magical metal objects affect you normally, as do
spells. Secondary effects delivered by metal items
affect you normally, such as a poisoned weapon
attack.
If the spell expires while metal is inside you, the
object is shunted out of your body or you are
pushed away from it to the nearest unoccupied
space; as a result, you and the object both take 1d6
bludgeoning damage.
Since you pass through metal objects, your
unarmed attacks ignore metal armor while you are
under the effects of this spell. This does not change
the Armor Class of a creature wearing metal armor,
but it grants you advantage on unarmed attack rolls
against such creatures.

Waiting for just the right moment, you transform
the water someone is drinking into deadly poison.
The quantity of water does not matter, just that the
target drinks more than a sip. It can also be a
beverage that is partially water (such as wine, beer,
or juice).
The creature who drinks makes a Constitution
saving throw. On a failure, the creature is poisoned
for the duration, and they take 4d8 poison damage.
If the creature fails the saving throw by 5 or more,
its Constitution score is reduced by 1d4. On a
success, the creature can choose to spit the water
out and take no damage, or continue to swallow it
and take half damage. If the creature failed its save,
at the start of each of the creature's turns before the
spell ends, it must succeed on a Constitution saving
throw or take 4d8 poison damage. On a successful
save, the spell ends.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can affect one
additional creature who is drinking at the same
time, and the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot
level above 4th.

in this spell description
You call to mind a long-forgotten memory that
helps you resist a condition that would dominate or
impede you. This memory may even come from
some kind of previous incarnation rather than your
current lifetime. You spend a Hit Die, but do not
regain any hit points. Instead, you prevent yourself
from suffering one of following conditions that
would otherwise afflict you: blinded, deafened,
paralyzed, poisoned, or restrained.
Once you cast this spell, until the end of your
next turn, your speed is halved and you cannot take
reactions. You must have at least one Hit Die when
you cast this spell, otherwise, the spell fails.
“The spell
liberating memory is highly useful, and under
the right circumstances it can be quite enlightening as well. It
was created by members of the Transcendent Order, also called
the Ciphers, a faction native to the Outer Planar
settlements,,particularly Sigil. They teach that the path to
enlightenment comes from knowing your body and learning to
listen to what existence is telling you to do instead of what your
mind is saying.
“This emphasis on trusting instinct over intellect and seeking
all answers from within may work for some spellcasters, but for
wizards, relying on logic and learning remains the most
advisable strategy.”

enchanted armor that protects you in a time of
need. This can be your choice of any kind of light
armor. If you are proficient with medium armor,
you can choose any kind of light or medium armor
with which you are proficienct. You instantly don
this armor as part of casting this spell. The armor is
magical, and in addition to the normal properties of
the type of armor you chose, it grants you a +1
magical bonus to Armor Class. Wielding a shield
does not interfere with this spell, but it ends if you
attempt to don other armor.

or higher, the armor can be your choice of any kind
of heavy armor with which you are proficient, as
well as light or medium. When you cast this spell
using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the armor
magical bonus increases to +2, and you can
concentrate on the spell for up to 8 hours.

vortex that forms in a water source you can see
within range. If the water source isn’t at least the

must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed
save, the creature is sucked into the vortex’s
swirling waters.

throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d6
bludgeoning damage, and it is sucked 10 feet closer
to the vortex’s center. On a successful save, the
creature doesn’t take damage, and isn’t sucked
closer to the vortex’s center. In addition, the

its speed, unless it has a swimming speed, in which
case it can use this full movement. On a failed
check, the creature doesn’t make any progress.

center, must make a Strength saving throw. On a
failed save, the creature takes 2d6 bludgeoning
damage and it is sucked 10 feet below the water’s
surface. A creature that reaches the vortex’s bottom,
60 feet below the surface, is ejected a further 20 feet
from below the vortex’s center.

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

You cause a grasping, clawed arm of living molten
earth like that of a magmin to erupt from the
ground as grasp your enemy. Choose a Medium or
smaller creature within range. The target takes 2d6
fire damage, has its speed reduced by half until the

saving throw. If it fails, it takes additional
bludgeoning damage equal to the fire damage
and becomes restrained. Creatures with
resistance or immunity to fire damage have
advantage on the saving throw.
While restrained by this spell, the target takes
1d6 fire damage at the start of each of its turns. A
creature restrained by the grasping claw or one that
can touch the creature can use its action to make a
Strength check against your spell save DC. On a
success, the target is freed.

spell, all flammable objects in its space that aren’t
being worn or carried are ignited.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using

Magnetism
=== SPELL END ===

=== SPELL START ===
Name: Magnetism
Level: 3
School: Transmutation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: S, M (a lodestone)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Description:
This spell allows you to draw iron or steel objects to
yourself by projecting a magnetic ray. Choose one
object within range that is nonmagical and made of
ferrous metal. This object must weigh less than 40
lbs. If the object isn’t being worn or carried, it
immediately flies into your space, where you can
either catch it with your hand (requiring no action)
or let it fall at your feet.
Using an action each round, you can target one
object you can see within range of the spell with
this effect.
If an object you target with this spell is being held
or carried by a creature, that creature must roll a
Strength saving throw. On a failure, the creature
drops the object, and it flies to your space, where
you either catch it with your hand or let it fall at
your feet. If the object is being worn by a creature
(like a helm or a chain shirt), the creature makes
the same Strength saving throw but has advantage
on the roll. On a failure, the creature is pulled up to
60 feet towards you if it is Medium-size or smaller.
If the item is secured in some way (such as being
chained to a wall or tied down with a rope), but not
being held or worn, you make an ability check to
break the restraint, as if you were making a Strength
check to break or burst whatever is securing it with
your own hands. Instead of making a Strength
check, you make a check with your spellcasting
ability score (adding your proficiency bonus). If the
check succeeds, you free the item and it flies to your
space as described above.
You can also attempt to move a metal creature
that weighs less than your limit for this spell (such
as a Tiny construct). The creature makes a Strength
saving throw with advantage against this effect. If
the save fails, you can move the creature toward you
just as you would any other metal object.
Until this spell ends, your ability to carry, lift,
push, or drag any objects you have moved to your
space with this spell is calculated as if you had a
Strength score of 20 (giving you a carrying capacity
of 300 pounds and allowing you to push, lift, or drag
up to 600 pounds, if you are Small or Medium
sized), unless your Strength if higher.
If you move during the spell’s duration, you can
choose any object that you moved to your space
with this spell which you are not carrying, lifting,
pushing, dragging, or wearing to either move with
you as you go (levitating just above the level of your
feet) or remain in the square you moved it to.
Once you move an object to your space with this
spell, you have advantage on saving throws and
opposed rolls against dropping it, and creatures
seeking to move the item from your space have
disadvantage on rolls to do so. When the spell ends,
if you are holding, wearing, or carrying an object
that is too heavy for you, it falls softly to the
ground, landing harmlessly at your feet.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the weight limit of
objects you can move with this spell increases by 10
pounds for each slot level above 3rd. When you cast
this spell using a spell slot of 5th or 6th level, you
can choose up to two objects within range each
time you use your action for this spell, instead of
just one. If the spell slot is 7th level or higher, you
can choose up to three objects instead.
Major Telekinetic Weapon

=== SPELL START ===
Name: Major Telekinetic Weapon
Level: 2
School: Conjuration
Casting Time: 1 bonus action
Range: Self
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Description:
You summon a simple or martial weapon weighing
no more than 20 lbs that normally costs no more
than 75 gp. It appears in your free hand, ready to be
wielded, and lasts for the duration. It is a magical
weapon made of your psychic energies. If you let go
of the weapon, it disappears, but you can evoke the
weapon again as a bonus action.
You can use your spellcasting ability instead of
Strength or Dexterity for the attack rolls of melee
attacks using this weapon. On a hit, it deals force
damage equal to 2d6 + your spellcasting ability
modifier, instead of the normal damage for a
weapon of that type. If the weapon normally has the
ammunition property, this version does not have
that property, but you must go through the physical
motions of loading it normally as part of the spell
(thus, a weapon with the loading property retains
that property as a telekinetic weapon). Attacking
with a weapon that normally has the ammunition
property creates temporary magical ammunition
that you use normally as part of the attack, but that
ammunition ceases to exist after the attack hits or
misses and any damage is inflicted.
Though it is no more delicate than a common
version of that weapon, your telekinetic weapon
manifests as a semi-transparent solid the same color
as your eyes. This weapon has the simplest possible
geometric shape it can have while still functioning
as the chosen type of weapon. At the end of the
spell's duration, it dissipates harmlessly.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 4th level or higher, it gains a magical
+1 bonus to attack rolls, and inflicts an additional
1d6 force damage on a hit. When you use a spell slot
of 6th level or higher, the magical bonus to attack
and damage rolls increases to +2, and the additional
force damage increases to 2d6 (for a total of 4d6 +
your spellcasting ability modifier).

You surround yourself with a glossy nimbus of
energy that looks like a gelatinous layer of thick,
dirty water to observers, but does not hinder you in
the least. For the duration of the spell, you gain the
following benefits:
 Oozes with an Intelligence of 3 or lower will not
attack you unless you attack them or force them
to make a saving throw.
 You are immune to poison damage.
 You are immune to the paralyed, poisoned,

 You are immune to any spell or effect that
would alter your form.
 Magic can’t put you to sleep.
 When an attack that hits you is a critical hit or
sneak attack, you gain resistance to its damage
“This spell began as a special gift given by Ghaunadaur, the
god of oozes, slime, and abominations, to his clerics. He is
sometimes known as the Elder Eye, though his relationship to
the Elder Elemental Eye is unclear. Originally a member of
the drow pantheon, the Elder Eye was touched by the Far
Realm and chose to leave the Inner Planes and strike off on his
own.
“Since that time, his only known allies have been two beings
now believed dead, the mold god Moander and the archomental
Bwimb, Baron of Ooze. Ghaunadaur’s enemies, however, are
many, including all the gods of elves and all the other gods of
the Underdark.
“Some say that Lolth spurned Ghaunadaur's romantic
interests, driving him to fit of fury in which he made his
greatest worshipers mad or mindless. If such an event did occur,
it was fortuitous, since in ancient times some slimes and oozes
possessed great intelligence. If this were still the case, today they
would pose a dire threat.”

You sprout thousands of small thorns. The thorns
drain the blood and warmth from others, digging
into them after a few seconds of contact. A creature
that you grapple or is grappled by you takes 1d6
piercing damage at the start of your turn. On your
turn you may use an action to make a melee attack
against the creature. If you hit, you inflict 1d6 plus
your Strength modifier piercing damage.
At Higher Levels. You can cast this spell using a

Mark of the Unfaithful
7th-level enchantment (ritual)
with the target’s name and especially consecrated
for this purpose, detailing the crimes (real or
imagined) for which the subject is being
condemned)
You permanently place a mark upon a character or
creature that identifies it as an enemy of your faith.
The chosen creature suffers the following effects:
 Any member of your faith feels innately hostile
towards the chosen creature, giving it
disadvantage on Charisma (Deception,
Performance, or Persuasion) checks against
members of your faith. This hostility might not
induce the viewer to attack, but the creature
will instinctively distrust or disbelieve anything
the marked one says.
 Members of your faith have advantage on
Wisdom checks against the chosen creature.
 The marked creature cannot benefit from any of
your faith’s services, such as spellcasting
provided by a temple of your faith, or naming,
marrying, or burial services.
You can place the mark of the unfaithful upon
any creature, even if it is on a different plane. You
cannot cast this spell on someone who is already
dead. Clerics, druids, paladins, and rangers of your
faith automatically detect this effect simply by
looking at the subject.
The effect is permanent until lifted, either by you
or another member of your faith of high enough
level to cast this spell. This spell is unaffected by
dispel magic or counterspell, though it can be
copied or undone using a wish.
Mark of the Vigilante
1st-level enchantment (ritual)
You adopt the persona of a vengeful agent of justice,
taking on a distinctive fighting style
that promises punishment to
those who seek to harm your
allies. For the duration, when
you hit a creature with a
weapon attack, you can mark
the creature until the end of
your next turn. This effect
ends early if someone else
marks the creature. While it is
within 5 feet of you, a creature
marked by you has
disadvantage on any attack roll
that doesn't target you and cannot
make opportunity attacks against
you.
In addition, until the spell
ends, you can use a bonus
action on each of your
turns to force one
creature within 10 feet
of you to roll a Wisdom
saving throw. It has
advantage on the
saving throw if you
do not currently
have a creature marked,
and it automatically succeeds if it is a construct or
undead. On a failure, a creature takes 1d6 psychic
damage and becomes frightened of you until the
end of your next turn.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 3rd or 4th level, you can concentrate
on the spell for up to 8 hours. With a slot that's 5th
level or higher, you can concentrate for up to 24
hours.
Maskstone
2nd-level illusion (ritual)
You mask a stone door to appear to be a
seamless part of a wall. If the wall is made of
a material that is not stone, then the door

Any attempt to discover the door is made
with disadvantage. Even detect magic
does not reveal the illusion.

information about the area as if you were there until

be examined in memory as if they were in front of
you and holding still. When you examine the area in
this way, you can only perceive the area as it was

changed since then.

damage is determined by the item's rarity, as
follows:
Artifacts take no damage from this spell. Most

You manifest a simple melee weapon or a short
sword, made of pure psionic energy. It appears in
your free hand, ready to be wielded, and lasts for
the duration. If you let go of the weapon, if you
dismiss it (no action required), or if you are
incapacitated, your telekinetic weapon disappears

of your next turn.
You can use your spellcasting ability instead of
Strength or Dexterity for the attack and damage
rolls of melee attacks using this weapon, and it
inflicts force damage instead of the normal damage
for a weapon of that type.
As part of the action of casting this spell, you can
make one melee attack with the weapon against a
creature within 5 feet of you. If you do so, for that
first attack only, the weapon inflicts an extra 1d4
force damage. After that, you attack with the
weapon normally.
Though it is no more delicate than a common
version of the weapon you have created, your minor
telekinetic weapon manifests as a semi-transparent
solid the same color as your eyes. This weapon has
the simplest possible geometric shape it can have
while still functioning as the chosen type of
weapon, and creatures who see it know it is a
magical effect you have created. At the end of the
spell's duration, the weapon dissipates harmlessly.
This spell's damage increases when you reach
higher levels. At 5th level, the extra force damage
you inflict when you make an attack with the
weapon as part of the action of casting this spell
increases by 1d4. This damage roll increases by an
additional 1d4 at 11th level and 17th level.

Description:
Select a non-humanoid target that you can see
within range. The target must make a Wisdom
saving throw. If it fails the save, the target is
charmed and under your mental control (as if under
the effects of the dominate monster spell).
Unlike the dominate monster spell, this effect
doesn’t grant the monster a saving throw whenever
it takes damage. However, if you give the creature
an order that is suicidal, self-destructive, or against
its very nature (such as ordering a celestial to
murder innocents), it can make another saving
throw with disadvantage to resist the order. If the
creature makes its saving throw, though it doesn’t
obey that particular order, it is still your thrall.
However, all future saving throws made to resist
that order are made with advantage.
If you maintain your concentration for
the full duration, the effect is

“Not only do the vast majority of mages lack the level of

“Of all the multiverse’s practitioners of the Art,
even among the ranks of the archmages, few
can match Mordenkainen in his meticulous
creativity when researching spells, his breadth
and precision in planar knowledge, or his sheer

—Laeral Silverhand
“I have considered Mordenkainen a friend
for centuries. For a time, we enjoyed
regular meetings, joined by a third wizard
from a distant plane (a black-robed elf
who was mentored by the most
terrifyingly ambitious archmage even I
ever heard of), and I eagerly looked
forward to our exchanges of arcane

You unleash deadly explosive power, like the effects
of the retributive strike created by breaking a staff
of power or staff of the magi. The spell converts any
unexpended spell slots you have into a blast of
magical energy, releasing your arcane power in an
explosion that expands to fill a sphere with a 30-foot

when you cast the spell.
In addition, each creature in the sphere’s radius

of damage based on how far it is from the blast’s
point of origin, as described below. On a successful
saving throw, a creature takes half damage.
All creatures within 10 feet of you when the blast
occurs take force damage equal to 8 × the number
of unexpended spell slots you had when you cast
this spell. Likewise, creatures between 11 and 20 feet
away from you take force damage equal to 6 × the
number of unexpended spell slots you had when
you cast this spell. Finally, creatures between 21 and
30 feet away from you take force damage equal to 4

when you cast this spell.

Mycontil cast this spell to defeat the

=== SPELL START ===
Name: Obedient Avalanche
Level: 9
School: Conjuration
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 300 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous
Description:
You summon an avalanche of snow out of a rift in
mid-air, burying your foes in icy graves. Choose a
point within range. The ground within a 60-foot
sphere centered on that point is covered in snow
and becomes difficult terrain for 1 hour. In addition,
all creatures within a 40-foot radius sphere centered
on the sam epoint must make a Dexterity saving
throw. The effects of the saving throw depend on a
creature's distance from the center of the effect.
A creature within a 20-foot radius sphere from
the point you chose who fails its saving throw takes
10d12 cold damage and 10d12 bludgeoning damage,
and it is buried in the snow (with effects as
described below), or it takes half damage and isn’t
buried on a successful save.
A creature outside of the 20-foot radius sphere,
but within 40 feet of its center, who fails its saving
throw takes 5d12 cold and 5d12 bludgeoning
damage, is pushed 20 feet away from the center
point, and falls prone. On a successful saving throw,
the creature takes half as much damage and is
pushed only 10 feet from the center point. Any
creature that fails its saving throw by 5 or more is
also buried in the snow.
A creature buried in the snow is restrained, and it
is surrounded by snow that provides full cover. On
its turn, a buried creature can use its action to make
a Strength check against your spell save DC. On a
success, it frees itself. Other creatures within 5-feet
of a buried creature can attemt to dig it out, but
freeing one buried creature requires one or more
others to use a total of ten actions digging. This can
be one creature using ten actions, five creatures
using two actions each, or some other combination
that equals a total of ten actions, over however
many rounds this requires.
Structures and inanimate objects in the area
suffer the same effects as creatures, which often
causes small trees to be uprooted and structures to
collapse. Even after the snow melts, rubble and
other detritus are left behind. All flames in the area
are extinguished, whether they are magical or not.

points of creatures this spell can affect. Creatures
within 20 feet of a point you choose within range

Subtract each creature's hit points from the total
before moving on to the creature with the next
lowest hit points. A creature's hit points must be
equal to or less than the remaining total for that
creature to be affected.
Starting with the creature that has the lowest
current hit points, each creature affected by this
spell has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability
checks until the spell ends. Each creature can
attempt to resist, but only at the risk of making its
agony even worse. Each creature affected by the
spell can choose whether to make a Constitution
saving throw to try to resist the spell’s effect at the
end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself
with a success. However, if the creature fails the
saving throw, it takes 3d6 psychic damage. A

Pocket Cave

=== SPELL START ===
Name: Pocket Cave
Level: 5
School: Conjuration
Casting Time: 1 minute
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M (a black piece of cloth
Duration: 8 hours
Description:
shaped like an arched doorway)
You conjure an extradimensional cave that has a
single entrance on the plane from which the spell
was cast. You can only cast this spell on a surface
made of rock or some form of earth within range.
The entry point looks like a dark cave entrance that
is 5 feet wide and 10 feet high. Only those you
designate can enter the cave, and all other creatures
and objects are barred from passing through. Spells
and other magical effects can’t extend through the
entry portal or be cast through it. The entry portal is
shut and made invisible behind you when you
enter. You can open it again from your side at will.
You can choose the shape of the cave inside. You
can form it into a hemispherical dome or a sphere
with a radius of up to 30 feet. It takes the form of a
dark, wet cavern. This area contains enough oxygen
to sustain as many creatures as can fit in the area
for the duration of the spell. Edible fungus grows
along the walls, and condensation drips down one
wall into a pool of fresh, clean water that never
seems to run dry. External conditions such as
weather do not affect the pleasant atmosphere of
the cave, and nothing except the designated
creatures can pass through the portal in either
direction. Until the spell ends, you can command
the interior to become dimly lit or dark.
At the end of the spell’s duration, all within the
pocket cave return to the spot where they entered
or else to the nearest open space, if that spot is
occupied.
“Most sources state that the orc god
Gruumsh was the first to grant his
clerics this spell, which seems oddly
inventive for the one-eyed one. However,
some sages believe that another orc
pantheon deity granted it first, and
Gruumsh’s shamans demanded credit be
given to their god instead. That seems
much more plausible.”

Pool of Deeds
4th-level divination (ritual)
You enchant a body of water of any size and name a
creature. This can be a living or dead individual.
The creature you name, or their corpse, does not
have to be physically present. The most important
events of that creature’s life will play out in the
water. The whole event will take about an hour.
You can also choose to view a specific story from
the target’s life. You must have general knowledge
of the story, but you don’t need to know specifics. If
you name a creature that does not want to have its
life events displayed, it can make a Charisma saving
throw to resist the spell. On a success, the pool
shows a series of random images.
“Another mysterious spell. The events it
depicts always seem to be momentous, but how
it determines which events matter enough to be
shown is unclear. This spell’s judgement
doesn’t seem to parallel that of the caster or the
target.”

shards hostile to your enemies. As
part of the action used to cast this
spell, you must make a ranged
weapon attack, otherwise, the spell
ends. If the attack hits, the target takes
an additional 2d10 piercing damage. Hit

Premonitory Vision
4th-level divination (ritual)
finish a short or long rest
You perceive a series of images that show you future
events. You ask a single question concerning a
specific goal, event, or activity to occur within seven
days. The DM offers a truthful reply. The reply
might be a short phrase, an explanation of your own
emotional reaction, or a description of a single
image you saw.
The spell doesn’t consider any possible
circumstances that might change the outcome, such
as the casting of additional spells, or the loss or gain
of a companion.
After you cast this spell, unless you treat yourself
with a special calming tincture that uses 25 gold
pieces worth of ingredients, you have disadvantage
on Wisdom, Dexterity, and Intelligence checks, and
on Constitution saving throws to maintain
concentration for 10 minutes.
If you cast the spell two or more times before
finishing your next long rest, you receive
increasingly confusing visions that muddle your
mind. For each casting after the first, the duration
of the negative effects for not imbibing a calming
tincture increase by an additional (cumulative) 10
minutes, and there is a cumulative 25* chance that
the information you perceive is random and
possibly unrelated to the question you asked. The
DM makes this roll in secret.

Duration: Until discharged
Description:
While casting this spell, you designate one creature
as the caller and tell it a command word that is used
to activate the wormhole. The caller may discharge
the spell by repeating the command word and
creating the wormhole. Communication and travel
are possible through the wormhole, which has
infinite range and can cross dimensional
boundaries.
Once the caller says the command word, the
caster hears a voice alerting that someone is calling.
The door knocker raises five feet off the ground. By
grasping the door knocker, the caster can open a
portal to the caller. The caster and the caller can
speak through the portal and the caster can look
around without stepping through. Spells can be cast
through the wormhole. The caster can also go
through the wormhole and join the caller. The
caster may collapse the wormhole at will. However,
the wormhole will only last 1 minute per spellcaster
level before collapsing, whether the caster wishes it
or not. If the wormhole remains open, anyone can

table to determine what color the ray is, and what
the secondary effect is:
Probe Thoughts
6th-level divination (ritual)
Your target must make a Wisdom saving throw. If it
fails, its mind opens itself to you. You gain access to
all of its memories and knowledge, even things the
target has buried deep in its subconscious. You may
learn the answer to one question per round. Your
question and the answer are conveyed
telepathically, and you do not need to speak the
same language. Creatures with an Intelligence less
than 3 may only answer in mental pictures.
The target is not aware of the probe unless you
wish it to be. If the target resists the probe
successfully, they know that someone has tried to
cast a spell on them, but not what the spell was nor
who cast it.

Your force of will teleports an object a short
distance away. You teleport one object you are
holding to an unoccupied space within range.
Alternatively, you can teleport the object to a
willing creature within range.
You can either cause the object to land at the
creature’s feet, or you can give the creature the
option to grasp it with a free hand, which requires
the creature to make a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check
with a DC of 11. If the creature succeeds, it is
instantly holding the object. If the check fails, the
object falls to its feet.
This cantrip can only teleport objects that weigh
25 pounds or less. In addition, it cannot affect
objects that you are not already holding when you
cast the spell.
Projected Magnification
2nd-level illusion (ritual)
Choose a 5 foot square within the range. That
square is recreated within 10 feet of you. The image
is purely visual, with no sound of smell. The image
is an obvious illusion, and creatures can see through
it. The spell creates a snapshot of the 5 foot area you
chose when you cast the spell, but nothing in the
area moves or changes. The area appears exactly as
it does at the time of the spell, and you do gain any
special means of vision. For instance, if the area is
covered in darkness, either natural or magical, then
so is the snapshot.

Description:
This spell functions the same as silent image, except
that the image remains invisible until triggered. You
decide what triggers the image when you cast the
spell, but the trigger must be audible, tactile,
olfactory, or visual. The most typical triggers
include touching an object that had the spell cast
upon it, stepping within 10 feet of the point where
the spell was cast, or speaking a certain phrase.
Once triggered, the image appears at the point
where you cast the spell and lasts for 10 minutes,
after which time the spell ends. You can pre-
program the image to move around once activated,
in a similar manner to silent image.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using
an 8th level spell slot you can add sound to the

You cast your mind's eye forward a split second,
predicting the best moment for a telling blow. As
part of the action used to cast this spell, you must
make a melee weapon attack against a creature
within range, otherwise the spell fails. You can use
your spellcasting ability instead of Strength for the
attack and damage bonus for this attack. If the
attack hits, it inflicts an additional 2d6 damage of
the weapon’s type, and the next attack roll made
against the target before the end of your next turn is
made with advantage.

You do not know what image the creature saw
unless you can read its thoughts by other means

Components: V
Duration: 1 round
Description:
As part of the action used to cast this spell, you
must make an unarmed strike or melee weapon
attack against one creature within the spell's range,
otherwise the spell fails. On a hit, the target suffers
the attack's normal effects. In addition, a black web
of necrotic energy radiates across its skin from
where it was struck until the start of your next turn.
If the target willingly takes a reaction before then, it
immediately takes 1d8 necrotic damage, and the
spell ends.
This spell's damage increases when you reach
higher levels. At 5th level, the melee attack deals an
extra 1d8 necrotic damage to the target, and the
damage the target suffers for taking a reaction
increases to 2d8. Both damage rolls increase by 1d8
at 11th level and 17th level.

Description:
You strike a blow fueled by the fury of the earth,
channeling volcanic energy into the very ground
beneath your feet.
As part of the action used to cast this spell, make
a melee weapon attack against a creature within

sphere centered on you becomes difficult terrain
until it is cleared. All creatures besides you within
the affected area must roll a Strength saving throw.
A creature takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage and 2d6
fire damage and is knocked prone on a failed save. If
the saving throw is successful, the creature takes
half the damage, and isn’t knocked prone. Molten
lava ignites flammable objects in the area that aren't
worn or carried.
The spell’s area remains difficult terrain until it is
cleared. Each 5-foot-square portion of the area
requires at least 1 minute to clear by hand.

elemental creatures (such as gargoyles or
salamanders) do not take damage from this spell.

one creature within the spell's range, otherwise the
spell fails. On a hit, the target suffers the attack's
normal effects and takes an additional 1d10 cold
damage, as its blood turns to leaden ice and its
limbs grow heavy. Until the end of your next turn,
the target's speed is halved, it takes a -2 penalty to
AC and Dexterity saving throws, and it can't use
reactions. On the target’s next turn, it can use either
an action or a bonus action, not both. Regardless of
the creature's abilities or magic items, it can't make
more than one melee or ranged attack during its
turn.

stand. The spell ends early if you are incapacitated,
restrained, or otherwise unable to move.
“The name of the moon elf swordmage and
bladesinger Quivaelyn Mondior is often left off
these spells, and some indicate that he is not
their true inventor, but rather merely recreated
effects that had been practiced in old Myth
Drannor. Quivaelyn is also well-known for
rediscovering lost elven traditions of battle
magic not long before the Time of Troubles
and for his later service as one of the most
trusted armathors (bodyguards) of Lady
Ilsevele Miritar, the seventh Coronal of the
rebuilt realm of Cormanthyr. He is known to
have survived the new Myth Drannor’s fall,
entering the service of a Cormyrean noble
family for a time, but seems to vanish from
history a few years after.
“In any case, his devoted scholarship has
preserved many swordmage spells that would
otherwise have been lost.”
—Laeral Silverhand
“Rumors say that Quivaelyn designed this
spell to emulate the ki-based movement
powers of his close ally, the monk Ang Si
Zhao of T’u Lung.
“Other rumors, from his late career,
say he fell in love with a human woman
and settled down to raise a family, either
in the rebuilt port of Ylraphon or
somewhere on the Sword Coast. “

to reactivate this effect, causing the triggering

its turn within 5 feet of you until the start of your
next turn to take 1d8 force damage.
“I believe this spell to be a recent creation,
crafted by Ariella Kulmina, a Windsoul genasi
swordmage from Airspur, though I know
Elminster’s scholarly opinion differs. He
concludes that Ariella discovered it in the
spellbook of the moon elf Josidiah Starym, a
famed bladesinger of old Myth Drannor.
“Wherever it originated, it is now a favorite
of those who combine blade and spell in battle,
in frequent use by spellcasting warriors of both
elven and genasi ancestry, as well as among the
githyanki gish.”
—Laeral Silverhand
“If this is not the spell Starym was
researching with an apprentice when he
and I crossed paths in Cormanthor in the
3rd Century, then by an unlikely
coincidence Kulmina researched a nearly
identical dweomer of her own over a
millennium later.”

Description:
Choose up to six creatures you can see within range.
Those creatures must make a Wisdom saving throw.
If they succeed the spell has no effect on that
creature. If they fail, the DM must provide you with
a one-word summary of the emotional state of each
creature, such as "happy," "confused," "afraid," or
"violent." You receive no information from this spell
about creatures that are not living (such as
constructs or undead) or from creatures which are
immune to psychic damage.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the number of
creatures whose mood you can read with this spell
is increased by two for each slot level above 1st.
“The practical value of knowing a possible
oppoenent’s emotional state cannot be
overestimated, especially when entering into
delicate negotiations or investigating the
commission of a crime. Certain casters may not
wish to spend their energies on it, but I can
attest that early use of read moods has oft saved
me the casting of many a meteor swarm spell
later on.”
—Laeral Silverhand
Read Object
6th-level divination (ritual)
You can concentrate on an object you are touching,
reading psychic impressions left on it by recent
events. At the end of the time you spend casting
this spell, you learn of any events within the past 24
hours that occurred within 30 feet of the object. You
see, hear, and smell those events from the object’s
point of view, as if you had been there at the time.
You also see a mental image of the last creature
that handled the object, also from the object’s
perspective, no matter how long ago the object was
last held. The only information you receive about
the creature is its appearance at that time
(including a sense of its size), whether it was alone
(although you can’t see any other creatures that
might have been there), and a one or two-word
description from the DM describing that creature’s
emotional state the last time it touched the object
(such as “Enraged”, “Extremely Agitated”, “Relaxed”,
“Satisfied”, “Utterly Emotionless”, etc.). If the
creature was not capable of emotion, or if its mental
state was too alien for you to understand, the DM
will tell you that instead.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 7th level or higher, if the object has
been handled by multiple creatures within the last
week, you get the same information about each
creature who handled it during that time the same
way you would normally receive about the last
creature who handled it.

All unattended objects weighing 50 pounds or less
in the extended area are pulled 20 feet closer toward
the maelstrom’s center, and then sucked into the

Components: V, S

Description:
With a whispered word and a piercing
gaze, you momentarily project an
impulse into your enemy's
mind, channeling its hostility towards you into a
sudden reflexive attack against another of your foes.
Choose one humanoid creature you can see within
range that can also see and hear you. The target
must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become
charmed by you until the start of its next turn. A
creature has advantage on this saving throw if it is
not currently in combat, or if it has witnessed
another creature fail its saving throw against your
casting of this spell within the past minute.
When you charm a target with this spell, any
other creatures who can see or hear you know you
have magically influenced the target, and you can
immediately choose one of two effects:
 You can force the charmed target to walk up to
15 feet, and you choose its movement. It will not
move into difficult terrain or through the spaces
of other creatures, and its movement only
provokes opportunity attacks from other
creatures hostile to you. After the creature
moves, the spell ends.
 You can make a melee spell attack against
another creature within 5 feet of the charmed
target. The charmed target delivers this melee
spell attack, as if it had cast the spell. On a hit,
the attack inflicts 1d6 psychic damage. Whether
the attack hits or misses, the spell ends.
When the spell ends, the creature realizes that
you used magic to control it and becomes hostile
toward you. It likely seeks to attack you or your
allies, but will not do so if doing so would be
disadvantageous for it or its friends. The creature
might also seek retribution in other ways (at the
DM’s discretion), depending on the situation.
The spell's damage increases by 1d6 when you
reach 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level
(4d6).
“Arguably the most powerful cantrip in battle. Not only
excellent for quickly establishing tactical controil, but also
invaluable for the fear and uncertainty it sows in the enemy’s
ranks.”

“On this point, I find myself in agreement
with the pitiful Mordenkainen. A rare
occasion, that.

a spell requiring an attack roll that you have not
cast since the last time you rolled initiative.
“This spell was first researched in the outer-
planar city of Sigil, by members of a faction
known as the Society of Sensation. Not all
casters are as eager for new experiences as the
creators of this spell, especially after a thousand
years or more of life, but the magic is potent
enough that it always achieves its practical
effect, regardless of the user’s state of mind.”

Sensory Caress
1st-level divination (ritual)
In a moment of quiet reflection, you touch a
creature and can take its pain or anguish onto
yourself, temporarily suppressing one condition
afflicting it. The condition can be blinded,
deafened, paralyzed, or poisoned. When you
suppress the condition, the creature is no longer
afflicted with it, but you immediately suffer the
same condition yourself for duration, even if you
would normally be immune to it. At the end of your
next turn, you can make a Constitution saving
throw against your own spellcasting DC. If you
succeed, the condition ends early for you, but it
remains suppressed for the original creature until
the spell ends. If you fail, you can make the saving
throw again at the end of each of your turns until

Giant poisonous snakes created by this spell

the ammunition, immediately after that creature’s

any verbal commands issued by the creature
controlling them (no action required by you). If that

“This spell is often associated with the cleric Serten, a close
friend of Tenser who died in battle some years ago. In fact, a
legendary archmage, also called Serten, created the spell long
before the famed cleric was born. Adding to the confusion was
the fact that the cleric Serten possessed a magic ring which
granted him the benefits of this spell.
“Tenser spent years blaming me for the cleric’s death.
Whether he ever forgave me or saw sense, I don’t know, but I
bear no responsibility for the man’s fate. The truth is, the cleric
Serten was a fool—a brave, kindly, helpful fool, but a fool
nonetheless—and he was undone by his own reckless yearning
for adventure.”

Servant Army
5th-level conjuration (ritual)
which many lengths of knotted thread are attached)
You create a number of invisible, mindless,
shapeless forces that perform simple tasks at your
command. Roll 3d4 to determine how many
servants you create. Each servant obeys any verbal
commands that you issue (no action required by
you). However, if you don't issue any commands, a
servant does nothing as it awaits your next
command.
Once you give a command, each servant performs
its task to the best of its ability until its task is
completed. It then waits for your next command.
Your servants can run and fetch things, open
unstuck doors, and hold chairs as well as clean and
mend. A servant can also be used for common
laborious tasks, if you carefully direct it. The
servants are no better or faster at tasks than a basic
or unskilled commoner would be.
The servants can serve food or wine at a banquet,
help dig earthworks, row a ship, act as porters, fold
clothes, or assist in a farmer’s fields. Each servant
can perform only one activity at a time, but it
repeats the same activity continuously if told to do
so. This allows you to command one servant to
perform a repetitive task and then turn your
attention elsewhere if you remain within range.
Servants can open only normal doors, drawers, lids,
and so forth. They have an effective Strength score
of 2 (so they can carry 30 pounds, and push, drag, or
lift 60 pounds). They can trigger traps and such, but
they can exert only 60 pounds of force, and that is
not enough to activate certain pressure plates and
other devices. A servant’s speed is 15 feet.
The servants cannot attack in any way, and are
never allowed to make an attack roll. The servants
have an Armor Class of 10 and 6 hit points. The
servants cannot be killed, but they dissipate after
taking 6 points of damage. (They do not make
saving throws). If you attempt to send a servant
beyond the spell’s range (measured from your
current position), that servant ceases to exist.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 6th level or higher, you create 1d4
additional servants for every slot level above 5th.
When you cast it using a spell slot of 7th level or
higher, the spell’s duration increases to 8 hours.
“On the eve of a naval battle, a wu-jen conjurer
of Koryo once inflicted great fear and chaos
upon a Kozakuran port with the servant army
spell. Making herself unseen with other tricks,
she would stand on the docks, magically
distract sailors on watch, have the invisible
servants she’d conjured board a ship and sail it
fifty feet or so from shore, then move to
another berth and repeat the same trick.
“Mages of Kara-Tur invented this spell, and
their region’s history records many creative
uses of it. The subtlety I often find so lacking in
the spellcasters of Faerûn seems to be much less
rare in the nations of that eastern continent.”

Shifting Paths
8th-level illusion (ritual)
This spell hides a path or road that you choose,
while also creating an illusory path that starts at a
point you choose within range. The illusory path
continues in a direction you choose for up to a
number of miles equal to 2 × your spellcasting
ability modifier. This illusory path avoids obstacles,
and does not provide bridges, stairs, ladders, ramps,
or other methods to travel through impassable
terrain. The path will not cross cliffs or rivers more
than four feet deep.
A creature following the original path must make
a Wisdom saving throw when it comes to the start
of the illusory path. On a failed save, the creature
follows the illusory path as if it were the real one. If
the path moves through difficult terrain, the
creature believes the path slopes and twists to
justify its reduction in speed.
On a successful save, the creature sees both
paths, but the illusory path appears shadowy.

Description:
from any destroyed undead creature)
You shroud yourself in necrotic energy, temporarily
gaining the traits of undeath. Your appearance does
not change except for a very slight pallor, but your
creature type changes to undead for the duration of
the spell.
Nonintelligent undead creatures perceive you as
one of their kind, ignoring you. Intelligent undead
do not immediately recognize you as alive, but may
question whether you are undead. Any ability check
made to determine that you are not truly undead is
made with disadvantage, and you have advantage
on all Charisma checks to convince others of your
undead nature.
If an undead creature does target you directly
with an attack or a harmful spell, that creature must
make a Wisdom saving throw (an undead needn't
make the save when it includes you in an area
effect, such as the explosion or fireball). On a failed
saving throw, the creature must choose a new target
or forfeit targeting someone else, potentially
wasting the attack or spell. A creature automatically
succeeds on this saving throw if it has made a
successful saving throw against this effect within
the last 24 hours or it has seen you target an undead
creature with an attack or other harmful effect
within the last 24 hours.
Because you are undead, if a spell or other effect
states that it does not affect undead, then it does
not affect you for the spell’s duration. Conversely,
effects that do affect undead (such as the Turn
Undead class feature) affect you as such.

Three fiery orbs appear and hover above you for the

a failed save, the target takes 2d6 fire damage, and
the mote detonates. The target and each creature
within 10-feet of the burst must make a Dexterity
saving throw. On a failed save a creature takes 5d6
fire damage, or half as much on a successful one.
Targets within 45 feet of the caster have
disadvantage on the initial saving throw.
If a target makes the initial Dexterity saving

You use several pieces of ancient amber to create a

you choose a command word. When the command
word is spoken, all three spells take effect

You charge ammunition with energy that makes it
anathema to a creature. Choose one creature type
while casting; while casting you can fire the arrow
or bolt,or give it to an ally to fire on their turn. If
the arrow or bolt hits, and the creature struck is the
creature type named during the spell casting, the
creature must make a Constitution saving throw. A
creature with more than 50 hit points automatically
succeeds. On a failure, it does. On a success, the
arrow deals an extra 8d6 necrotic damage. This
extra damage ignores resistance and immunity.
Sleep of Horror
3rd-level necromancy (ritual)
A target you choose within range must make an
Intelligence saving throw. If it fails the save, its next
sleep is wracked with terrifying nightmares, and

that, every time it finishes a long rest, it must make
the Intelligence saving throw again. If it fails, it
gains no benefit from the long rest. If it succeeds,
the spell ends. The spell continues until the target
makes its Intelligence saving throw, or until it dies.

Snow Boots
1st-level transmutation (ritual)

saving throws, Charisma checks, and Charisma

greater restoration or heal spell must choose to
affect either the Wisdom or Charisma of the target

damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above

Description:
You marshal psychic energies to move with speed
and acrobatic grace. When you cast this spell, you

action on your turn, you can expend a speed point,
granting yourself all of the following benefits until
the end of that turn:
 Your speed increases by 10 feet.

surfaces and upside down along ceilings, while
leaving your hands free.

brittle terrain, such as dust, silt, mud, snow, or
thin ice. This effect does not allow you to move
over liquid surfaces.
 If you move at least 20 feet straight toward a
creature and then hit it with a melee weapon
attack on the same turn, that attack inflicts an
additional 1d4 damage.
At the end of the turn, the benefits fade entirely
until you spend another speed point. If these
benefits end while you are still on a vertical surface,
or anywhere else where you would normally fall or
sink, you immediately fall or begin to sink unless
you have some other means to remain there.
This spell ends when its duration expires, when
you cast this spell again, or when you have spent all
your speed points. When the spell ends, any unspent
speed points are lost.
At Higher Levels. If you cast this spell with a
spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the extra damage
you inflict with melee weapon attacks against
opponents when you move 20 feet increases by 1d4
for each slot level above 1st. In addition, if you cast
this spell with a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you
gain one additional speed point for every two slot
levels above 1st.
“The sorcerer who first created this
spell seems to have adapted it from
certain psionic disciplines practiced by

disintegrated creature)
You conjure a 5-foot diameter featureless black
sphere of nothingness that disintegrates almost
anything it touches. The sphere appears in an
unoccupied space of your choice within range and
lasts for the duration.
Any creature that ends its turn within 5 feet of
the sphere must make a Dexterity saving throw. The
target takes 12d6 + 60 force damage on a failed save,
or half as much on a success. If this damage reduces
the target to 0 hit points, it is disintegrated, as if by
the disintegrate spell. A disintegrated creature and
everything it is wearing and carrying, except magic
items, are reduced to a pile of fine gray dust. The
creature can be restored to life only by means of a
true resurrection or a wish spell.
As an action, you can move the sphere up to 30
feet. When you move the sphere, it flies, and you
can move it any direction you wish. If you ram the
sphere into a creature, that creature must make the
saving throw against the sphere’s damage. If you
ram the sphere into a Medium or smaller object
that is not being held or carried, that object is
disintegrated. If you ram this sphere into a Huge or
larger object, it disintegrates the 5-foot cube area of
that object it strikes. If you ram the sphere into a
creation of magical force (such as the wall created
by a wall of force spell), it has the same effect on
that magical force that it would have on an object of
the same size. Magic items are not affected by this
spell.
Whenever you ram the sphere into a creature or
object, it uses up 10 feet of movement for every 5
feet it moves through the space occupied by that
creature or object. No object or creature can be
affected by the sphere more than once in the same
turn.

type. Anyone, including you that casts a spell using
a different damage type within the light must make
a Wisdom saving throw. If they succeed the spell

the light. The light automatically dispels magical

Static Shock

=== SPELL START ===
Name: Static Shock
Level: cantrip
School: Abjuration
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 15 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 round
Description:
Make a ranged spell attack against a creature within
range. If the attack hits, the creature takes 1d4
lightning damage and it is charged with crackling
arcane energy until the spell ends. If the target
makes an attack roll before the end of its next turn,
it takes force damage equal to your spellcasting
ability modifier. If the attack hits, the damage the
attack inflicts is reduced by an amount equal to the
force damage dealt by this spell. Either way, the
spell ends after the attack is resolved.
At 5th level, the lightning damage from the
ranged spell attack increases by 1d4, and the force
damage dealt to a target who attacks equals 1d4 +
your spellcasting ability modifier. Both damages
increase by 1d4 at 11th and 17th level.
”Two artificers—both gnomes, one hailing from the city of
Korranberg on the world of Eberron, the other from the island
of Lantan off the Sword Coast of Abeir-Toril, neither aware
of the other’s existence—each claim to be the inventors of this
cantrip.
“One might be lying, or it could be a rare case of parallel
invention, but my own suspicion is that each is taking credit for
a spell that came to their world from a third, as yet unknown
source.”

Components: V, S

Description:
You slow an opponent while making yourself faster.
Make a melee spell attack against the target. On a
hit, the target takes 1d4 psychic damage, and its
speed is reduced by 10 feet until the start of your
next turn. Until the start of your next turn, you add
a number of feet to your own speed equal to the
number of feet by which you reduced the target’s
speed.
At Higher Levels. This spell’s damage increases
by 1d4 when you reach 5th level (2d4), 11th level
(3d4), and 17th level (4d4). In addition, the speed
you steal increases by 5 feet as well when you reach
5th level (15 feet), 11th level (20 feet), and 17th level
(25 feet).
“Some consider spells relating to certain
powerful, mysterious forces such as time,
gravity, true names, momentum, and the
underlying energies contained within all
matter—to be the most difficult to master.
Different sages across the Multiverse know
these varied fields of spellcasting by many
names—chronomancy, Cataclysm magic,
dunamancy, chaos magic, velocimancy,
allomancy, cryptomancy, or simply the magic
of Forces— but there are few worlds in which
they are well-understood.
“Then, of course, there are spells like steal
speed, which manipulate these phenomena in
an extraordinarily sophisticated way, and yet
do so by means that can be taught to the
beginning apprentice. I attribute the research
and creation of such spells to a level of genius
that no one can be taught—like being a musical
prodigy, it is a miraculous talent one must be
born with.”
—Laeral Silverhand
“On the point of such ‘talent’ only being innate, I must
respectfully disagree with the lady. Should we give up the study
of wizardry and leave the most sophisticated forms of magic to
mere
sorcerers, then? I think not.”

This spell links any two buildings made of stone
that can be any distance apart but are both on the
same plane of existence. Each temple area must
have a stone platform large enough for one creature
to stand upon, which is used as a teleportation pad.
Before the spell is cast, each platform must be
prepared by crushing 2,000 gold pieces worth of
gemstones and performing a 10-minute ritual.
To complete the spell, you must perform another
10-minute ritual using the remaining 1,000 gold
pieces worth of crushed gemstones. During the final
ritual, a command word is chosen that will be used
to travel back and forth between the teleportation
pads. When the command word is spoken, one
person may be transported with up to 100 pounds of
gear.
Teleportation using this spell is infallible and
cannot be blocked by magical barriers or wards
against teleportation. If the destination pad is

When casting this spell, you point in a direction and

action on each of your turns, you can change the
direction of the cone up, down, or sideways by 10
feet.
The vortex whirls around any creature caught in
its area, blasting it with fist-sized balls of force, and
jolting it with small lightning strikes. The creature
takes 5d4 bludgeoning damage from the wind
buffets, and 2d4 lightning damage. A successful
Dexterity saving throw halves the bludgeoning
damage, but not the lightning damage.
In addition, a spellcaster caught in the cone must
make a successful Constitution saving throw when
casting a spell with somatic components. Though it
is against your normal spellcasting DC, this saving
throw is the equivalent of a roll to maintain
concentration on a spell, and special benefits or
other effects the creatures has on such Constitution
saving throws apply.
Storm of Elemental Fury

=== SPELL START ===
Name: Storm of Elemental Fury
Level: 7
School: Conjuration
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 300 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: 4 rounds
Description:
A furious storm erupts in a 40-foot radius, 100-foot-
high cylinder centered on a point you choose within
range. When you cast this spell, and again at the
beginning of each of your turns until the spell ends,
the storm produces one of the following effects,
starting with the first, and then progressing down
the list.
1st turn. The storm buffets the area with a raging
windstorm. No creature within the area can make
ranged attacks or be the target of a ranged attack. A
Small or smaller creature caught in the storm’s area
must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed
save, the creature is swept up, thrown 2d6 × 10 feet
in a random direction, and takes 1d6 bludgeoning
damage per ten feet thrown. A Medium creature
must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be
knocked prone. A Large or larger creature must
succeed on a Strength saving throw or its speed
drops to 0.
A Large flying creature that fails its saving throw
is blown 1d6 × 5 feet in a random direction, Medium
f lying creatures are blown 1d6 × 10 feet, and Small
flying creatures are blown 2d6 × 10 feet away.
For the spell's duration, any creature must make a
Constitution saving throw the first time it tries to
cast a spell inside the area. If it fails, it cannot cast
spells within the area until the spell ends. A
creature that failed its saving throw can make
another Constitution saving throw at the beginning
of each of its turns. If it succeeds, it can cast spells
normally again.
2nd turn. Rocks fall from the sky, pummelling
creatures caught in the storm’s area. Each creature
caught in the area takes 5d6 bludgeoning damage
(no save).
3rd turn. Heavy rain pours into the area,
automatically extinguishing unprotected flames,
and extinguishing protected flames 50% of the time.
Visibility within the area is reduced to 5 feet, and
the entire area of the spell becomes difficult terrain.
4th turn. Gouts of flame rain down from the sky
into the storm’s area. Any creature caught within
the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a
failed save, a creature takes 14d6 fire damage, or
half as much if successful.
“The Kingdom of Aundair’s First Warlord and
Royal Minister of Magic, Adal ir'Wynarn, is
desperate to acquire a cataclysmic spell of
just this type. He yearns to rain down death
upon the forces of Thrane which occupy
aundair’s lost capital city, Thaliost.”
“Providing this spell would purchase great
influence over Adal, and through him over all
of the wizards of Aundair. The fact that
casting it requires a higher level of mastery
than he possesses would, of course, not be our
problem. If anything, a greater need for
arcane empowerment would only encourage
him to indebt himself to us more.”

shield that blocks acid, cold, fire, lightning, and
thunder damage. The shield attracts all elemental
discharges and neutralizes them, granting all
creatures within a 30-foot radius from its center
immunity to the listed damage types. However, the
shield's immunity is limited. If the shield reduces
damage a creature would take to 0, the spell ends if
it is not the first time that the shield has reduced
damage that particular creature would have taken
to 0 since this spell was cast.

winds surrounds you. The swirling winds nullify any
lightning effects that contact the barrier. In
addition, ranged attacks through the barrier are
impossible. A creature that tries to pass through the
barrier must succeed on a Strength saving throw;
otherwise it takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage from
the high winds, and it makes no progress. A
creature can make more than one attempt to cross
the barrier on its turn, but it receives one level of
exhaustion for each unsuccessful attempt beyond
the first.
Once the storm tower appears, it is stationary for

Sustain Fire
1st-level transmutation (ritual)
Choose a fire within range. For the duration, the fire
consumes no fuel or oxygen. Even if the fire is
plunged into something that would normally
extinguish a fire (water, sand, or an enemy) the fire
continues to burn. An object removed from the fire
consumes fuel as normal and will go out if all the
fuelor oxygen is consumed.
Sustaining Meditation
3rd-level abjuration (ritual)
You enter a heightened state of consciousness in
which you have complete awareness and control of
your body’s natural processes. Until this spell ends,
you are able to heal yourself for a limited number of
hit points. You gain a pool of 20 hit points worth of
self-healing. As a bonus action on your turn, you
can draw self-healing from the pool to restore a
number of hit points to yourself, up to the
maximum amount remaining in your pool.
Once all the self-healing of the pool is expended,
it does not replenish unless you cast the spell again.
When this spell ends, any unused healing in the
pool is lost.
Alternatively, if you have at least 5 hit points
remaining in your self-healing pool, you can use a
bonus action to neutralize one poison affecting you,
or to cure yourself of one disease or one of the
following conditions: blinded, deafened, paralyzed,
or poisoned. When you do this, the spell ends
immediately.
In addition, for the duration of this spell, you
don’t need to eat or sleep (though you still need to
finish a long rest to prepare spells or regain any
abilities that require a long rest) and whenever you
hold your breath, you can do so for five times as
long as normal. If you have at least 1 hit point
remaining in your self-healing pool, you have
advantage on saving throws against poison and
resistance to poison damage.
This spell ends when you finish a long rest, or
when you cast it again.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the pool of self-
healing it confers is increased by 5 hit points for
each slot level above 3rd.

You share another creature's pain, taking part of its

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Description:
For the duration, you can turn another spell you
cast into healing energy. Instead of its normal
effect, the spell you cast is held until you touch
another creature before the duration expires; the
creature you touch regains 1d10 hit points per level
of the spell slot used to cast the triggering spell,
and then this spell ends.
For example, you could cast this spell, and while
you maintain concentration, you could cast mind
blank using an 8th-level spell slot, and before the
duration expires, you could touch a creature and
cause it to regain 8d10 hit points.
“This spell is often known as The Simbul’s
Synostodweomer, after its creator, the Simbul,
known as the Witch-Queen of Aglarond, my
dearly departed sister.
“At first, I was surprised that Elminster had not
made this note, but he may yet find the pain of
my sister’s passing too acute for such a
comment.
“Those familiar with my own history will no
doubt mark places in this grimoire where I too
have chosen to remain silent.
“Yet writing about this spell gives me joy, not
sorrow, in remembering my sister, who was the
greatest spellcaster of us all—arguably the
greatest who ever lived. So much of her
instinctive grasp of magic is displayed here, her
cleverness and efficiency, that casting it almost
feels like having her by my side once more.
“The decades since the Time of Troubles have
piled up loss upon loss upon loss, more than
any prior century I can remember. Even for the
most powerful, in our hearts we all remain
shackled by time’s cruelties.”

against a creature within your reach. On a hit, you
choose one special or racial trait which you know
the creature possesses (such as one you have seen it
use) and remove it from the creature until the spell

trait from an aboleth or a water genasi, that
creature would no longer be able to breathe both air
and water.
When you cast this spell, you choose a second
target, which must be another willing creature
within 30 feet. Until the spell ends, that creature
gains the racial or special trait you removed from
the first target.
However, the Ability Score Increase racial trait,
Legendary Resistance, Innate Spellcasting, or
Spellcasting traits are not affected by this spell, nor
are any other traits that are either not listed under
the traits section of the stat block or not listed
among the traits it receives for being a member of a
certain race. You could not, for example, remove an
action or legendary action with this spell, nor could
you remove its Armor Class or Passive Perception.
The DM may also rule that certain traits are too
intrinsic to the nature of a creature to be removed,
such as the Water Form trait of a water elemental.
However, if a creature has no traits you can affect
with this spell, the DM will inform you before you
use an action to cast the spell.
At the end of each of the first target’s turns, it can
make a Constitution saving throw against the spell.
On a success, the spell ends.

You manipulate what was once an ode to fate,

fortune. Choose one target within range to make a
Charisma saving throw. On a failure, the target
takes 3d6 psychic damage and has disadvantage on
the next attack roll it makes before the end of its
next turn. On a success, the target takes half

on its saving throw, you can choose one ally within
60 feet to gain advantage on the next attack roll it

terrible word that will blast your foe’s soul into
oblivion and reduce its body to ashes. Choose one

saving throw or immediately die. A target with
more than 150 hit points automatically succeeds on
this saving throw. A creature slain by this effect
cannnot be brought back to life by any means,
including wish or true resurrection.
Speaking this word takes a toll on the spellcaster
as well. You must make a Constitution saving
throw, using the same DC as the target. If you fail,
you are slain outright, and cannnot be brought back
to life by any means, including wish or true
resurrection. On a success, you immediately die, but

In the split-second a creature lets its guard down
after it makes a successful attack, you batter your
way into its mind. The creature that inflicted the
triggering damage must make a Wisdom saving
throw. It takes 4d10 psychic damage on a failed
save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
On a failed save, until the spell ends, you also gain
all of the following benefits against the target:
 As long as you and the target are on the same
plane, you always know its location, and if you
share a language you can communicate with it
telepathically.
 The target can't become hidden from you, and if
it's invisible, it gains no benefits from this
condition against you.
 The target provokes opportunity attacks from
you even if it takes the Disengage action before
leaving your reach.
 While you are on the same plane as the target,
you always know its surface thoughts what is
most on its mind in that moment and as your
action on each turn until the spell ends, you can
attempt to probe deeper into the creature's
mind, as if with the detect thoughts spell.
If you or the target are knocked unconscious or
killed, the spell ends early.

damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above

“A loathesome, treacherous spell, named for its loathesome and
treacherous creator.”
—Mordenkainen
Greetings, my patron,
In sending this uniquely fascinating grimoire via
caravel to Martira Bay (from whence I trust our
mutual associate has conveyed it to you, my patron), I
had not intended to include any notes of my own in
its already crowded pages. However, in perusing the
spells within, I came across this spell, which I had
only previously seen named as your creation.
However, as recorded here, its name does not
attribute my patron at all. Rather, it is entitled Vecna’s
final command, seemingly referencing the powerful
undead archmage who briefly ruled the domain of
Cavitius, prior to the conflagration that consumed
the (aptly named) cluster of Burning Peaks. I write,
for scholarship’s sake, to seek a clarification, given my
patron’s obvious direct knowledge of the matter.
In any case, I remain grateful for my patron’s faith
in my researches. Please expect my next larger volume
soon, detailing my travels in the Nocturnal Sea, as
well as narrating how I found this spellbook in the
Library of Neverwere Manor, on the isle of Liffe, an
ordeal which I was fortunate to survive.
Regards,
S—
I return this spellbook, having my own
existing copy, cleansed of the distracting
scribbles of lesser minds.
Have a care what notes you make in such
tomes, especially with mention of your patron’s
name. These writings reach more eyes than you
know. It is not a sort of recklessness to be
tolerated twice.
As for my spell named falsely, do not concern
yourself with the subject again. Nor with Vecna.
—A

these notes are interesting. Most
interesting. And very, very useful.”

leap from your mouth to land in each space.
Until the spell ends, on each of your turns, you

Giant poisonous snakes created by this spell are
considered fiends. They are immune to fire damage

If you have six or more summoned snakes present

snakes gains temporary hit points equal to the hit

required by you), and they obey any commands that
you issue to them. If you don't issue any commands

throw. On a failure, it is charmed by you until the
spell ends or until you or your companions do
anything harmful to it. A creature charmed by this
spell regards you as a friendly acquaintance, and it
feels the need to tell others you should be treated as
a friend. It is also compelled to touch any other
creatures it sees that are hostile to you.
When one of the initial targets becomes
charmed by this spell, the next two creatures it
touches before the spell ends must make the same
Wisdom saving throw, becoming charmed on a
failure and suffering the same effects.
A creature who is charmed after being
touched by one or more of the initial
targets only forces the next creature it
touches to make the Wisdom saving
throw, instead of the next two
creatures.
Creatures who become charmed
by this spell after being touched by
a creature that was not one of the

Description:
which shatters when the spell is cast)
You draw molten lava up through the ground,
which erupts to fill a sphere with a radius of 360
feet. The entire radius (even the sky above it and
the underground beneath it) immediately becomes
difficult terrain for the duration, and each creature
within that radius must make a Dexterity saving
throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d6
bludgeoning damage and 2d6 fire damage, and its
walking speed is reduced to 0 until the start of its
next turn. On a success, a creature takes half as
much damage and suffers no other effects. A
creature with full cover is still affected, but
automatically succeeds on its saving throw. You
take no damage from this spell, and automatically
succeed on saving throws against it.
Until the spell ends, if you can see some part of
the area of the spell, you can use a bonus action on
each of your turns to force each creature in the area
to make another saving throw or suffer the above
effects. You cannot cast this spell if you are more
than 360 feet away from an area of solid ground at
least 10 feet wide, but once it is cast, it lasts for the
duration, even if you are out of range.
When a creature wearing metal armor fails its
saving throw against this effect, it takes 2d6
additional fire damage, and has disadvantage on
attack rolls and ability checks until the start of its
next turn (as if affected by the heat metal spell).
Firenewts, earth-based elemental creatures (such
as gargoyles), or fire-based elemental creatures
(such as salamanders), do not take damage from
this spell. Instead, such a creature is healed,
regaining hit points equal to half the fire damage
inflicted. Only firenewts or creatures of the
elemental type can benefit from this effect.
The volcanic eruption damages objects in the area
and ignites flammable objects that aren't being
worn or carried. Structures in contact with the
ground in the area that take fire damage from this
effect take extra bludgeoning damage equal to half
the fire damage. If a structure drops to 0 hit points,
it collapses and potentially damages nearby
creatures, as described in the earthquake spell. The
eruption can be heard up to 500 miles away.
This spell leaves its entire area a blackened ruin
incapable of supporting plant life for a full year.
After that time, however, the ground is more fertile
than it was before the spell was cast.
“A powerful planar mage of my
acquaintance, the Crowngold, late of
Ylraphon, claims that this spell not only
works perfectly well on the bottom of
the sea, but also in elemental planes
where molten earth does not flow
beneath the surface, such as the Planes
of Air and Water. In fact, she found it
useful in such places to quickly expand a
small mote of earth into a substantial
island of solid rock. But first one must
find some earth to stand on!”

Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 5 feet
Components: V, M (a slashing weapon)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Description:
As part of the action used to cast this spell, you
must make a melee attack with a weapon against
one creature within the spell's range, otherwise the
spell fails. The weapon attack ignores resistance to
slashing damage. On a hit, the target suffers the
attack's normal effects and takes an extra 6d8
slashing damage from the hit. On a miss, the spell
ends.
If the initial attack hits, the weapon retains its
enchantment for the duration. Until the spell ends,
the weapon ignores resistance to slashing damage,
and once per turn, when you hit a creature with a
weapon attack, you can use a bonus action to cause
that creature to take an extra 6d8 slashing damage
from the hit.
In addition, while this spell is active (including
during the initial attack), if you attack a creature
that has at least one head with the weapon and roll
a 20 on the attack roll, you cut off one of the
creature's heads. The creature dies if it can't survive
without the lost head. A creature is immune to this
effect if it is immune to slashing damage, doesn't
have or need a head, has legendary actions, or the
DM decides that the creature is too big for its head
to be cut off with this weapon.

Watchware
4th-level abjuration (ritual)
and powdered reagents worth at least 500 gp)
You create a mystical connection with a single
inanimate object you touch. When that object is
damaged, moved, or touched at any later time, you
are instantly aware of this fact. If another creature
physically touches the warded object, you receive a
mental image of the creature.
For purposes of divination spells (such as
scrying), you are considered to have first-hand
knowledge of the creature who triggered the effect
as if you had met.
This effect activates when the object is
disturbed for any reason, whether someone
touches it or pokes it with a pole, a cat
walks upon it, or an earthquake knocks it
over.
This spell ends as soon as the
effect is activated. Because
of its costly material
components, most
spellcasters
reserve
this
spell to protect valuable, out-of-the-way items.
This spell is considered a magical trap. It can be
detected with an Intelligence (Arcana or
Investigation) check made against your spellcasting
DC, but it can only be dispelled magically. You can
designate a password that allows another creature
to handle the object without sounding the mental
alarm if you choose.

The paper or parchment must be folded into the shape
of an animal before casting the spell. It then becomes an
animated paper animal of the kind the folded paper most
closely resembles. The creature uses the stat block of any
beast that has a challenge rating of 0. It is made of paper,
not flesh and bone, but it can do anything the real creature
can do: a paper owl can fly and attack with its talons, a
paper frog can swim without disintegrating in water,
and so forth. It follows your commands to the best of its
ability, including carrying messages to a recipient whose
location you know.
The duration increases by 24 hours at 5th level (48

School: Transmutation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self
Components: V, S
Duration: 2 hours
Description:
This spell creates a link between you and a nearby source
of arcane power, allowing you to draw on its strength to
bolster your spellcasting ability. When you cast a spell,
you can use a bonus action to draw on the link. Doing
so means you expend no spell slots to cast the spell, the
energy instead comes from the external power.
The more you draw on the link, the harder it is to
maintain. Each spell you cast in this manner decreases the
duration of the arcane parasite spell by 10 minutes per level
of the spell you cast using the link. For example, if you cast
a fireball spell using the link, you would not expend a spell
slot in the casting, but the duration of this spell would
decrease by 30 minutes. If you cast a spell using the link
and your remaining duration is equal to or less than the
spell’s level × 10 minutes, then this spell ends as soon as
that spell is cast.

the target’s race)
When cast on a dead or undead body, as you were returns
that creature to the appearance it had in life while it was
healthy and uninjured. The target must have a physical
body; the spell fails if the target is normally noncorporeal.
If as you were is cast on a corpse, its effect is identical to
that of gentle repose, except that the corpse’s appearance is
restored to that of a healthy, uninjured (albeit dead) person.
If the target is an undead creature, it also is restored to
the appearance it had in life, even if it died from disease
or from severe wounds, or centuries ago. The target
looks, smells, and sounds (if it can speak) as it did in life.
Friends and family can tell something is wrong only with
a successful Wisdom (Insight) check against your spell
save DC, and only if they have reason to be suspicious.
(Knowing that the person should be dead is sufficient
reason.) Spells and abilities that detect undead are also
fooled, but the creature remains susceptible to Turn
Undead as normal.
This spell doesn’t confer the ability to speak on undead
that normally can’t speak. The creature eats, drinks, and
breathes as a living creature does; it can mimic sleep, but it
has no more need for it than it had before.
The effect lasts for a number of hours equal to your
caster level. You can use an action to end the spell early.
Any amount of radiant or necrotic damage dealt to the
creature, or any effect that reduces its Constitution, also
ends the spell.
If this spell is cast on an undead creature that isn’t your
ally or under your control, it makes a Charisma saving
throw to resist the effect.

As an action, the target can make a bite attack using
either Strength or Dexterity (Melee Weapon Attack: range
5 ft., one creature; Hit: 2d6 piercing damage), and the
creature must make a successful DC 14 Constitution

You alert a number of creatures that you are familiar with,
up to your spellcasting ability modifier (minimum of 1), of
your intent to communicate with them through spiritual
projection. The invitation can extend any distance and
even cross to other planes of existence. Once notified, the
creatures can choose to accept this communication at any
time during the duration of the spell.
When a creature accepts, its spirit is projected into
one of the gems used in casting the spell. The material
body it leaves behind falls unconscious and doesn't need
food or air. The creature's consciousness is present in the
room with you, and its normal form appears as an astral
projection within 5 feet of the gem its spirit occupies. You
can see and hear all the creatures who have joined in the
assembly, and they can see and hear you and each other as
if they were present (which they are, astrally). They can't
interact with anything physically.
A creature can end the spell's effect on itself voluntarily at
any time, as can you. When the effect ends or the duration
expires, a creature's spirit returns to its body and it regains
consciousness. A creature that withdraws voluntarily from
the assembly can't rejoin it even if the spell is still active. If
a gem is broken while occupied by a creature's astral self,
the spirit in the gem returns to its body and the creature
suffers two levels of exhaustion.

After spending the casting time enchanting a ruby along

with sentience. If the object has no face, a humanoid face
appears on it in an appropriate location. The awakened
object's statistics are determined by its size, as shown on
the table below. An awakened object can use an action to
make a melee weapon attack against a target within 5 feet
of it. It has free will, acts independently, and speaks one
language you know. It is initially friendly to anyone who
assisted in its creation.
An awakened object's speed is 30 feet. If it has no
apparent legs or other means of moving, it gains a flying
speed of 30 feet and it can hover. Its sight and hearing
are equivalent to a typical human's senses. Intelligence,
Wisdom, and Charisma can be adjusted up or down by the
GM to fit unusual circumstances. A beautiful statue might
awaken with increased Charisma, for example, or the
bust of a great philosopher could have surprisingly high
Wisdom.
An awakened object needs no air, food, water, or

You issue a challenge against one creature you can see

make an ability check as a bonus action. For example, you
could make a Strength (Athletics) check to climb a difficult
surface or to jump as high as possible; you could make a
Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to perform a backflip; or you
could make a Charisma (Performance) check to sing a high
note or to extemporize a clever rhyme. You can choose to
use your spellcasting ability modifier in place of the usual
ability modifier for this check, and you add your proficiency
bonus if you're proficient in the skill being used.
The charmed creature must use its next action (which

in a contest against your check. Even if the creature can't
perform the action—it may not be close enough to a wall
to climb it, or it might not have appendages suitable for
strumming a lute—it must still attempt the action to the

You seal an agreement between two or more willing

Regardless of the time of day or your location, you

traps, or hidden hazards. An enemy creature that makes a
successful Charisma saving throw resists the effect and is
not picked out by the moon’s glow.
The glow does not make invisible creatures visible, but
it does indicate an invisible creature’s general location
(somewhere within the 5-foot beam). The light continues

Candle’s insight is cast on its target as the component candle
is lit. The candle burns for up to 10 minutes unless it’s
extinguished normally or by the spell’s effect. While the
candle burns, the caster can question the spell’s target, and
the candle reveals whether the target speaks truthfully.
An intentionally misleading or partial answer causes the
flame to flicker and dim. An outright lie causes the flame to
flare and then go out, ending the spell. The candle judges
honesty, not absolute truth; the flame burns steadily
through even an outrageously false statement, as long as
the target believes it’s true.
Candle’s insight is used across society: by merchants while
negotiating deals, by inquisitors investigating heresy, and
by monarchs as they interview foreign diplomats. In some
societies, casting candle’s insight without the consent of the
spell’s target is considered a serious breach of hospitality.

Cleaning away the jam takes an action, but doing so has

The jam's flavor is determined by the material component.
The spell can affect constructs, with two limitations.
First, the target creature negates the effect with a
successful Dexterity saving throw. Second, unless the

mutilate your enemy.
As part of the action used to cast this spell, you make a
ranged weapon attack with a bow or a crossbow against

(which deals no additional damage), the target takes an
additional 1d8 slashing damage at the end of its next turn
from spinning blades that briefly sprout from the missile’s
shaft. Afterward, the projectile reverts to normal.
This spell deals more damage when you reach higher

A fused creature can use its action to make a Charisma

You summon an incorporeal undead creature that appears

summoned creature despises being bound and might
harm or impede you and your companions by any means
at its disposal other than direct attacks if the opportunity
arises. At the beginning of the creature’s turn, you can use
your reaction to verbally command it. The creature obeys
your commands for that turn, and you take 1d6 psychic

broken, the creature doesn’t disappear. Instead, you can
no longer command it, it becomes hostile to you and your

it has a chance to win the fight or to inflict meaningful
harm; otherwise it flees. You can’t dismiss the uncontrolled

You manipulate the thinking of a creature within range,

If the target tries to cast a spell with a casting time of

take effect until the creature’s next turn, and the creature
must use its action on that turn to complete the spell. If it
can’t do so, the spell is wasted. If the target interacts with
an object while taking its action, such as drawing a sword
as part of an attack, it must also roll a d20. On an 11 or
higher, it must make the interaction with the object its sole
action on that round, taking the Use An Object action. In
the example given, the target would take its action drawing
the sword with an extensive amount of flourish or drama

yourself, must make a Constitution saving throw when
the spell is cast and again at the start of each of your turns
while the spell is in effect. A creature whose saving throw
fails is restrained; a restrained creature whose saving
throw fails is paralyzed; and a paralyzed creature whose
saving throw fails is petrified and transforms into a statue

creatures recover immediately when the spell ends, but
petrification is permanent.

When you cast doom of dancing blades, you create 1d4
illusory copies of your weapon that float in the air 5 feet
from you. These images move with you, spinning, shifting,
and mimicking your attacks. When you are hit by a melee
attack but the attack roll exceeded your Armor Class by 3
or less, one illusory weapon parries the attack; you take no
damage and the illusory weapon is destroyed. When you
are hit by a melee attack that an illusory weapon can’t parry
(the attack roll exceeds your AC by 4 or more), you take
only half as much damage from the attack, and an illusory
weapon is destroyed. Spells and effects that affect an area
or don’t require an attack roll affect you normally and don’t
destroy any illusory weapons.
If you make a melee attack that scores a critical hit while
doom of dancing blades is in effect on you, all your illusory
weapons also strike the target and deal 1d8 bludgeoning,
piercing, or slashing damage (your choice) each.
The spell ends when its duration expires or when all your
illusory weapons are destroyed or expended.
An attacker must be able to see the illusory weapons to

Description:
When you cast doom of disenchantment, your armor and
shield glow with light. When a creature hits you with an
attack, the spell counters any magic that provides the attack
with a bonus to hit or to damage. For example, a +1 weapon
would still be considered magical, but it gets neither +1 to
hit nor +1 to damage on any attack against you.
The spell also suppresses other magical properties of
the attack. A sword of wounding, for example, can’t cause
ongoing wounds on you, and you recover hit points lost
to the weapon's damage normally. If the attack was a spell,
it’s affected as if you had cast counterspell, using Charisma
as your spellcasting ability. Spells with a duration of
instantaneous, however, are unaffected.

Range: Self (10-foot radius)
Components: V, S, M (a vial of poison)
Duration: Instantaneous
Description:
You drink a dose of venom or other poison and spread
the effect to other living things around you. If the poison
normally allows a saving throw, your save automatically
fails. You suffer the effect of the poison normally before
spreading the poison to all other living creatures within
10 feet of you. Instead of making the usual saving throw
against the poison, each creature around you makes
a Constitution saving throw against the spell. On a
successful save, a target suffers no damage or other effect
from the poison and is immune to further castings of doom
of serpent coils for 24 hours. On a failed save, a target doesn't
suffer the poison’s usual effect; instead, it takes 4d6 poison
damage and is poisoned. While poisoned in this way, a
creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its
turns. On a subsequent failed save, it takes 4d6 poison
damage and is still poisoned. On a subsequent successful
save, it is no longer poisoned and is immune to further
castings of doom of serpent coils for 24 hours.
Multiple castings of this spell have no additional effect
on creatures that are already poisoned by it. The effect can
be ended by protection from poison or comparable magic.

addition to the normal effect of the attack. If the foe is
using a nonmagical shield, it breaks into pieces. If the
foe doesn’t use a shield, its nonmagical armor takes a -2

Description:
The ground within 30 feet of a point you designate turns
into filthy and slippery muck. This spell affects sand, earth,
mud, and ice, but not stone, wood, or other material. For
the duration, the ground in the affected area is difficult
terrain. A creature in the area when you cast the spell must
succeed on a Strength saving throw or be restrained by
the mud until the spell ends. A restrained creature can
free itself by using an action to make a successful Strength
saving throw. A creature that frees itself or that enters
the area after the spell was cast is affected by the difficult
terrain but doesn’t become restrained.
Each round, a restrained creature sinks deeper into the
muck. A Medium or smaller creature that is restrained
for 3 rounds becomes submerged at the end of its third
turn. A Large creature becomes submerged after 4 rounds.
Submerged creatures begin suffocating if they aren’t
holding their breath. A creature that is still submerged
when the spell ends is sealed beneath the newly solidified
ground. The creature can escape only if someone else digs
it out or it has a burrowing speed.

Range: 120 feet
Components: V, S, M (dust from a stone quarry)
Duration: 1 minute
Description:
You create a ripple of dark energy that destroys everything
it touches. A 10-foot-radius, 10-foot-deep, cylindrical
extradimensional hole appears on a horizontal surface of
sufficient size. Since it extends into another dimension,
the pit has no weight and does not otherwise displace the
original underlying material. You can create the pit in the
deck of a ship as easily as in a dungeon floor or the ground
of a forest.
The pit’s radius expands by 10 feet at the start of your
turn each round for the duration. Any creature standing
in the original conjured space, or on a space taken up by
the pit as it grows, must succeed on a Dexterity saving
throw to avoid falling in. Any creature adjacent to the pit
when it expands must likewise succeed on a Dexterity
saving throw to avoid falling in. Creatures subjected to
a successful pushing effect (such as by a spell like gust of
wind) may not make this saving throw. Creatures that fall
into the pit take falling damage as normal.
The walls of the pit are slick and slimy, requiring a DC
15 Strength (Athletics) check to climb. Creatures and
objects that remain in the pit take 1d6 necrotic damage
at the start of each of their turns. If you fall into your own
pit, you take damage; then the spell ends and you are
incapacitated for 2 rounds. When the spell ends, the floor
of the pit rises, bringing creatures in the pit back up to the
original surface. Each creature in the pit must then make a
Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is
stunned for 2 rounds after the spell ends.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can increase the depth
of the pit by 10 feet for each slot level above 3rd.

on that surface must make a successful DC 20 Strength
(Athletics) check or immediately fall from the surface
unless it is held in place by ropes or other climbing gear. A
creature standing on an affected floor falls prone unless
it makes a successful Dexterity saving throw. Creatures
that try to climb or move through the affected area can
move no faster than half speed (this is cumulative with the
usual reduction for climbing), and any movement must
be followed by a Strength saving throw (for climbing) or a
Dexterity saving throw (for walking). On a failed save, the

Description:
You perform an ancient incantation that summons flora
from the fey realm. A creature you can see within range
is covered with small, purple buds and takes 3d8 necrotic
damage; a successful Wisdom saving throw negates the
damage but doesn’t prevent the plant growth. The buds
can be removed by the target or an ally of the target within
5 feet who uses an action to make a successful Intelligence

save DC, or by a greater restoration or blight spell. While
the buds remain, whenever the target takes damage from
a source other than this spell, one bud blossoms into a
purple and yellow flower that deals an extra 1d8 necrotic
damage to the target. Once four blossoms have formed in
this way, the buds can no longer be removed by nonmagical
means. The buds and blossoms wilt and fall away when the

If a creature affected by this spell dies, sweet-smelling

Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 8 hours
Description:
You command the earth beneath your feet to rise and
surge forward, carrying you and your companions where
you bid while rolling over enemies and obstacles in your
path. The earth rises in a 15-foot-high, 15-foot-radius
swell that can carry you and up to eight other Medium
creatures, propelling you in whatever direction you
choose at a rate of up to 90 feet per round. You use
a bonus action to direct the wave each round. Your
movement is limited to the surface of the wave to
maintain control. If you move off the wave, it continues
on the same course you directed it, then the spell ends at
the beginning of your next turn.
Natural obstacles do not impede the spell’s movement;
trees, rocks, and other natural obstacles simply rise up and
around the swell and settle back into place behind it. The
wave can travel up or down natural slopes with angles as
great as 60 degrees.
You can direct the wave to surge over man-made
obstacles and creatures in its path. The swell washes over
walls and other manufactured obstacles up to 15 feet high
and 10 feet thick with no loss of movement, dealing 6d6
bludgeoning damage to an object as it passes. Resolve this
damage against larger, rigid objects, such as walls, vehicles,
or other similar structures; smaller or malleable objects
such as unsecured ropes or cloth are simply buried by the
swell’s passing. Larger objects are subject to the damage,
but the wave cannot move over them unless the damage is
enough to destroy the object.
Creatures of Large size or smaller in the path of the wave
take 6d6 bludgeoning damage and are buried. Buried
creatures are considered restrained and must hold their
breath or begin to suffocate. A creature in the path of the
wave can make a Dexterity saving throw against your
spell save DC. On a successful save, the creature takes half
as much damage and avoids being buried. Each round,
a buried creature can use an action to make a Strength
check against your spell save DC to dig itself out.
You can cast earth wave only when standing on natural
earth or stone. The spell can be cast underground, but not
inside buildings unless they have no floor.

For the spell’s duration, the target takes 2d4 psychic

You touch a creature with a ring that has been etched
with symbols representing a particular ability (Strength,
Dexterity, and so forth). The creature must make a
successful Constitution saving throw or lose one-fifth
(rounded down) of its points from that ability score.
Those points are absorbed into the ring and stored there
for the spell’s duration. If you then use an action to touch
the ring to another creature on a later turn, the absorbed
ability score points transfer to that creature. Once the
points are transferred to another creature, you don’t need
to maintain concentration on the spell; the recipient
creature retains the transferred ability score points for the
remainder of the hour.
The spell ends if you lose concentration before the
transfer takes place, if either the target or the recipient
dies, or if either the target or the recipient is affected by
a successful dispel magic spell. When the spell ends, the
ability score points return to the original owner. Before
then, that creature can’t regain the stolen attribute points,
even with greater restoration or comparable magic.
At Higher Levels. If you cast this spell using a spell

Description:
You cause slabs of rock to burst out of the ground or other
stone surface to form a hollow, 10-foot cube within range.
A creature inside the cube when it forms must make a
successful Dexterity saving throw or be trapped inside the
stone tomb. The tomb is airtight, with enough air for a
single Medium or Small creature to breathe for 8 hours. If
more than one creature is trapped inside, divide the time
evenly between all the occupants. A Large creature counts
as four Medium creatures. If the creature is still trapped
inside when the air runs out, it begins to suffocate.
The tomb has AC 18 and 50 hit points. It is resistant to

Description:
You cause the target to radiate a harmful aura. Both the
target and every creature beginning or ending its turn
within 20 feet of the target suffer 2d6 poison damage per
round. The target can make a Constitution saving throw
each round to negate the damage and end the affliction.
Success means the target no longer takes damage from the
aura, but the aura still persists around the target for the
full duration.
Creatures affected by the aura must make a successful
Constitution saving throw each round to negate the
damage. The aura moves with the original target and is
unaffected by gust of wind and similar spells.
The aura does not detect as magical or poison, and is
invisible, odorless, and intangible (though the spell’s
presence can be detected on the original target). Protection
from poison negates the spell’s effects on targets but will
not dispel the aura. A foot of metal or stone, two inches of
lead, or a force effect such as mage armor or wall of force will
block it.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
spell slot of 6th level or higher, the aura lasts 1 minute

Creatures in the area take 5d8 piercing damage and are

A creature that starts its turn in the area and is already

Description:
You make natural terrain in a 1-mile cube difficult to
traverse. A creature in the affected area has disadvantage
on Wisdom (Survival) checks to follow tracks or travel
safely through the area, as paths through the terrain seem
to twist and turn nonsensically. The terrain itself isn’t
changed, only the perception of those inside it. A creature
that succeeds on two Wisdom (Survival) checks while in
the terrain discerns the illusion for what it is and sees the
illusory twists and turns superimposed on the terrain.
A creature that reenters the area after exiting it before
the spell ends is affected by the spell even if it previously
succeeded in traversing the terrain. A creature with
truesight can see through the illusion and is unaffected by
the spell. A creature that casts find the path automatically
succeeds in discovering a way out of the terrain.
When you cast this spell, you can designate a password.
A creature that speaks the word as it enters the area

School: Necromancy
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self
Components: V, S, M (tupilak idol)
Duration: 1 hour or until triggered
Description:
This spell functions only against an arcane or divine
spellcaster that prepares spells in advance and that has
at least one unexpended spell slot of 6th level or lower. If
you make a successful melee attack against such a creature
before the spell ends, in addition to the usual effect of that
attack, the target takes 2d4 necrotic damage and one or
more of the victim’s available spell slots are transferred to
you, to be used as your own. Roll a d6; the result equals the
total levels of the slots transferred. Spell slots of the highest
possible level are transferred before lower-level slots.
For example, if you roll a 5 and the target has at least one
5th-level spell slot available, that slot transfers to you. If the
target’s highest available spell slot is 3rd level, then you might
receive a 3rd-level slot and a 2nd-level slot, or a 3rd-level slot
and two 1st-level slots if no 2nd-level slot is available.
If the target has no available spell slots of an appropriate
level—for example, if you roll a 2 and the target has
expended all of its 1st- and 2nd-level spell slots—then grasp
of the tupilak has no effect, including causing no necrotic
damage. If a stolen spell slot is of a higher level than you’re
able to use, treat it as of the highest level you can use.
Unused stolen spell slots disappear, returning whence
they came, when you take a long rest or when the creature
you stole them from receives the benefit of remove curse,
greater restoration, or comparable magic.

You instill an irresistible sense of insecurity and terror in

On a failed save, the target has disadvantage on Dexterity
(Stealth) checks to avoid your notice and is frightened of
you while you are within its line of sight. While you are

Duration: 8 hours
Description:
When you cast this spell, choose a direction (north, south,
northeast, or the like). Each creature in a 20-foot-radius
sphere centered on a point you choose within range must
succeed on a Wisdom saving throw when you cast this spell
or be affected by it.
When an affected creature travels, it travels at a fast
pace in the opposite direction of the one you chose, as it
believes a pack of dogs or wolves follows it from the chosen
direction. When an affected creature isn’t traveling, it is
frightened of your chosen direction. The affected creature
occasionally hears howls or sees glowing eyes in the
darkness at the edge of its vision in that direction. An
affected creature will not stop at a destination, instead
pacing half-circles around the destination until the effect
ends, terrified that the pack will overcome it if it stops
moving. An affected creature can make a Wisdom saving
throw at the end of each 4-hour period, ending the effect
on itself on a success.
An affected creature moves along the safest available
route unless it has nowhere to move, such as if it arrives
at the edge of a cliff. When an affected creature can’t
safely move in the opposite direction from your chosen
direction, it cowers in place, defending itself from
hostile creatures, but otherwise takes no actions. In
such circumstances, the affected creature can repeat the
saving throw every minute, ending the effect on itself on
a success. The spell’s effect is suspended when an affected
creature is engaged in combat, enabling it to move as
necessary to face hostile creatures.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
spell slot of 6th level or higher, the duration increases by 4
hours for each slot level above 5th. If an affected creature
travels for more than 8 hours, it risks exhaustion as if on a

one clay pigeon maneuvers to block the incoming attack.
If the attack roll is less than 10 + your proficiency bonus,

Description:
You can learn information about a creature whose blood
you possess. The target must make a Wisdom saving

fail the saving throw voluntarily if it wants you to learn the
information. On a successful save, the target isn’t affected,
and you can’t use this spell against it again for 24 hours.
On a failed save, or if the blood belongs to a dead creature,
you learn the following information:
• The target’s most common name (if any).
• The target’s creature type (and subtype, if any), gender,
and which of its ability scores is highest (though not the
exact numerical score).
• The target’s current status (alive, dead, sick, wounded,
healthy, etc.).
• The circumstances of the target shedding the blood
you’re holding (bleeding wound, splatter from an
attack, how long ago it was shed, etc.).
Alternatively, you can forgo all of the above information
and instead use the blood as a beacon to track the target.
For 1 hour, as long as you are on the same plane of
existence as the creature, you know the direction and
distance to the target’s location at the time you cast
this spell. While moving toward the location, if you are

Description:
You willingly take a vow to complete a task or carry out
a service. This task or service cannot conflict with your
alignment or your sacred oath. While you serve under the
vow, for as long as the spell lasts, your hit point maximum
and current hit points increase by 10. Whenever you make
an attack roll or a saving throw, roll a d4 and add the result
to the attack roll or saving throw. These benefits apply
only when you are involved in activities that directly relate
to your avowed task, or to situations you encounter that
interfere with your ability to carry out that task (such as
random encounters while traveling).
If you willingly forsake your vow, the spell ends, and
you take 4d10 psychic damage. At the GM’s discretion,
you might suffer other penalties and need to atone for
your decision. See the “Breaking Your Oath” sidebar in
the paladin class description for more details. Failing to
complete the task does not incur any penalties as long
as you remain true to your vow, nor are you penalized if
some form of outside coercion, magical or otherwise,
leads you to forsake your vow (being charmed, for
instance, or if a villain threatens the lives of innocents if
you do not break the vow).

You write on parchment, paper, or some other
suitable writing material and imbue it with a powerful
enchantment that lasts for the duration. What is actually
written is unimportant; the enchantment laid upon the
words works on the mind of a creature that reads it,
convincing the creature that there is some importance to
the message that must be discovered. A creature that reads
the message must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw
or be compelled to continue reading and rereading the
writing, attempting to glean its meaning and importance.
During combat, a creature so enthralled can take no
actions or reactions on its turn, but can move if it chooses
or needs to do so (to remove itself from danger, for
example). A creature under the influence of the hypnotic
missive can make a new saving throw against the effects
at the beginning of its turn if in a combat situation. In
nonthreatening conditions, the creature can make a new
saving throw against the effects every hour.
Once a creature has made a successful save, it recognizes
the magical compulsion that has affected it. This does
not provide immunity from the spell, however, and if the
creature reads the words again, it must make another save
or fall under the spell’s effects once more.

On a failed save, the creature believes the object contains
a trap. If the creature then tries to disarm or otherwise
interact with the trap in order to set it off, it must make
a Dexterity check against your spell save DC. On a
successful check, the creature takes 1d10 psychic damage

AC 20 and 60 hit points, and it can be broken open with
a successful DC 25 Strength (Athletics) check. The walls
are made of stone (AC 15) and are immune to necrotic,
poison, and psychic damage. Each 5-foot-square section

With this spell, you instantly transform raw materials
into a siege engine of Large size or smaller (the GM has
information on this topic). The raw materials for the spell
don’t need to be the actual components a siege weapon is
normally built from; they just need to be manufactured
goods made of the appropriate substances (typically
including some form of finished wood and a few bits of
worked metal) and have a gold piece value of no less than
the weapon’s hit points.
For example, a mangonel has 100 hit points. Instant siege
weapon will fashion any collection of raw materials worth
at least 100 gp into a mangonel. Those materials might be
lumber and fittings salvaged from a small house, or 100 gp
worth of finished goods such as three wagons or two heavy

Description:
You create a snare on a point you can see within range.
You can leave the snare as a magical trap, or you can use
your reaction to trigger the trap when a Large or smaller
creature you can see moves within 10 feet of the snare. If
you leave the snare as a trap, a creature must succeed on an
Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom (Perception) check
against your spell save DC to find the trap.
When a Large or smaller creature moves within 5 feet of
the snare, the trap triggers. The creature must succeed on
a Dexterity saving throw or be magically pulled into the
air. The creature is restrained and hangs upside down 5
feet above the snare’s location for 1 minute. A restrained
creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of
its turns, escaping the snare on a success. Alternatively, a
creature, including the restrained target, can use its action
to make an Intelligence (Arcana) check against your spell
save DC. On a success, the restrained creature is freed, and
the snare resets itself 1 minute later. If the creature succeeds
on the check by 5 or more, the snare is destroyed instead.
This spell alerts you with a ping in your mind when the
trap is triggered if you are within 1 mile of the snare. This
ping awakens you if you are sleeping.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell

with a range of touch on your champion as if the spell had
a range of 60 feet. Your champion’s attacks are considered
magical, and you can use a bonus action on your turn to
encourage your champion, granting it advantage on its

If you become the champion of another creature, you
gain advantage on all attack rolls against creatures that
have attacked your charge within the last round. If you
are wielding a shield, and a creature within 5 feet of you
attacks your charge, you can use your reaction to impose
disadvantage on the attack roll, as if you had the Protection

any weapon, the weapon deals an extra 1d6 damage of the
same type dealt by its weapon to a hindered creature.
Tracking. A helped creature has advantage on Wisdom

Description:
Upon casting this spell, you immediately gain a sense of
your surroundings. If you are in a physical maze or any
similar structure with multiple paths and dead ends,
this spell guides you to the nearest exit, although not
necessarily along the fastest or shortest route.
In addition, while the spell is guiding you out of such a
structure, you have advantage on ability checks to avoid
being surprised and on initiative rolls.
You gain a perfect memory of all portions of the structure
you move through during the spell’s duration. If you revisit
such a portion, you recognize that you’ve been there before
and automatically notice any changes to the environment.
Also, while under the effect of this spell, you can exit any
maze spell (and its lesser and greater varieties) as an action
without needing to make an Intelligence check.

transported into a labyrinth and is under attack by savage
beasts. An affected creature must choose either to face the

You instill up to six creatures within range with the

saving throws against any spell or effect that causes the
frightened condition. When a creature protected by this

mentality and capability to do so—laugh at the creature
that caused the frightened condition. That creature must

When you cast lava stone on a piece of sling ammo, the
stone or bullet becomes intensely hot. As a bonus action,
you can launch the heated stone with a sling: the stone
increases in size and melts into a glob of lava while in
flight. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. If it
hits, the target takes 1d8 bludgeoning damage plus 6d6
fire damage. The target takes additional fire damage at the
start of each of your next three turns, starting with 4d6,
then 2d6, and then 1d6. The additional damage can be
avoided if the target or an ally within 5 feet of the target
scrapes off the lava. This is done by using an action to

While in a forest, you call a legion of rabid squirrels to
descend from the nearby trees at a point you can see
within range. The squirrels form into a swarm that uses
the statistics of a swarm of poisonous snakes, except it
has a climbing speed of 30 feet rather than a swimming
speed. The legion of squirrels is friendly to you and your
companions. Roll initiative for the legion, which has
its own turns. The legion of squirrels obeys your verbal
commands (no action required by you). If you don’t issue
any commands to the legion, it defends itself from hostile
creatures but otherwise takes no actions. If you command
it to move farther than 60 feet from you, the spell ends and
the legion disperses back into the forest. A canid, such as
a dog, wolf, fox, or worg, has disadvantage on attack rolls
against targets other than the legion of rabid squirrels
while the swarm is within 60 feet of the creature. When the

knows that you tried to manipulate it with magic. If you
successfully lie to a creature that has a friendly attitude
toward you, it must make a Charisma saving throw. On
a failed save, you can also coax the creature to reveal a

This spell doesn’t sense creatures that are dead. A creature
trying to hide its life force from you can make a Charisma

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Description:
You target a piece of metal equipment or a metal
construct. If the target is a creature wearing metal armor
or is a construct, it makes a Wisdom saving throw to
negate the effect. On a failed save, the spell causes metal to
cling to metal, making it impossible to move pieces against
each other. This effectively paralyzes a creature that is
made of metal or that is wearing metal armor with moving
pieces; for example, scale mail would lock up because the
scales must slide across each other, but a breastplate would
be unaffected. Limited movement might still be possible,
depending on how extensive the armor is, and speech is
usually not affected. Metal constructs are paralyzed. An
affected creature or construct can repeat the saving throw
at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on
a success. A grease spell dispels lock armor on everything in
its area.
At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one
additional creature for each slot level above 2nd.

reconfiguring it to give it switchbacks and curves that
make the trail loop back on itself. For the duration, the
trail makes subtle changes in its configuration and in
the surrounding environment to give the impression of
forward progression along a continuous path. A creature

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Description:
This spell causes creatures to behave unpredictably, as
they randomly experience the full gamut of emotions
of someone who has fallen head over heels in love. Each
creature in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you
choose within range must succeed on a Wisdom saving
throw when you cast this spell or be affected by it.
An affected target can’t take reactions and must roll
a d10 at the start of each of its turns to determine its
behavior for that turn.
d10 Behavior
1-3 The creature spends its turn moping like a
lovelorn teenager; it doesn’t move or take actions.
4–5 The creature bursts into tears, takes the Dash
action, and uses all its movement to run off in a
random direction. To determine the direction, roll
a d8 and assign a direction to each die face.
6 The creature uses its action to remove one item
of clothing or piece of armor. Each round spent
removing pieces of armor reduces its AC by 1.
7–8 The creature drops anything it is holding in its
hands and passionately embraces a randomly
determined creature. Treat this as a grapple
attempt which uses the Attack action.
9 The creature flies into a jealous rage and uses its
action to make a melee attack against a randomly
determined creature.
10 The creature can act and move normally.
At the end of each of its turns, an affected target can make
a Wisdom saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a
successful save.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
spell slot of 5th level or higher, the radius of the sphere
increases by 5 feet for each slot level above 4th.

driven insane for 10 minutes, per the symbol spell. On a

Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
Description:
You magnetize a large piece of metal or stone (such as a
door, a stone pillar, or a 5-foot-square section of floor) that
you touch, giving it a powerful attraction to ferrous metal.
Any iron objects within 50 feet of the target that are not
fastened down or being held or worn are pulled toward it,
moving against or up to the target and remaining there.
Any creature located between such an object and the
magnet might be struck; roll a ranged spell attack against
the target’s AC. On a hit, the target takes 2d10 damage of
the appropriate type (bludgeoning for a hammer, slashing
or piercing for a sword, and so forth).
Objects held by or in the possession of a creature are
also attracted. The creature must succeed on a Strength
saving throw to retain a grip on any held or worn objects.
On a successful save, the creature retains possession of
the object, but is dragged 5 feet closer to the magnet.
A creature can voluntarily release a metal object in its
possession and forgo a save.
Creatures garbed in mostly metal armor, or made
of metal, are also attracted to the magnet, and have
disadvantage on their saving throws to avoid being pulled
toward it. If such a creature succeeds on its saving throw,
it can move away from the magnet on its turn, but the
area within 50 feet of the magnet is considered difficult
terrain. If the creature is still in this area at the start of its
next turn, it must make another successful saving throw
to avoid being drawn toward the magnet. A creature that
comes into contact with the magnet is restrained. It can
negate this condition by using an action and succeeding
on a Strength check against your spell save DC to remove
itself from the magnet.

You summon a cylindrical sinkhole filled with burning
ash and grasping arms made of molten metal at a point on
the ground you can see within range. The sinkhole is 20
feet deep and 50 feet in diameter, and is difficult terrain.
A creature that’s in the area when the spell is cast, or that
begins its turn in the area or enters it during its turn, takes
10d6 fire damage and must make a Strength or Dexterity
(creature’s choice) saving throw. On a failed save, the
creature is restrained by the molten arms, which try to
drag it below the surface of the ash.
A creature that’s restrained by the arms at the start of
your turn must make a successful Strength saving throw
or be pulled 5 feet farther down into the ash. A creature
pulled below the surface is blinded, deafened, and can’t
breathe. To escape, a creature must use an action to make
a successful Strength or Dexterity check against your spell
save DC. On a successful check, the creature is no longer
restrained and can move through the difficult terrain of
the ash pit. It doesn’t need to make a Strength or Dexterity
saving throw this turn to not be grabbed by the arms again,
but it must make the saving throw as normal if it’s still in
the ash pit at the start of its next turn.
The diameter of the ash pit increases by 10 feet at the
start of each of your turns for the duration of the spell. The
ash pit remains after the spell ends, but the grasping arms
disappear and restrained creatures are freed automatically.
As the ash slowly cools, it deals 1d6 less fire damage for

in the animated body. You can use an action to manipulate
the body’s limbs in order to make it move, and you can
see and hear through the body’s eyes and ears, but your
own body becomes unconscious. The animated body can
neither attack nor defend itself. This spell doesn’t change
the appearance of the corpse, so further measures might
be needed if the body is to be used in a way that involves
fooling observers into believing it’s still alive. The spell
ends instantly, and your consciousness returns to your
body, if either your real body or the animated body takes
any damage.
You can’t use any of the target’s abilities except for

combat with you, it will use other attack actions to deal
damage if possible, but will continue to use its bite attack if
it has no other option.
If you are swallowed by a creature, immediately after you
take whatever damage is dealt by the creature’s digestion,

such as clairvoyance count as seeing). Once you or a willing
creature passes through, both doors shut, ending the spell.
If you or another creature does not move through the

The geyser is 5 feet in diameter and 40 feet high. Each
creature in the cylinder when it erupts or at the start of
your turn takes 10d8 fire damage, or half as much damage
if it makes a successful Dexterity saving throw.
The geyser also forms a pool of lava at its base. Initially,
the pool is the same size as the geyser, but at the start
of each of your turns for the duration, the pool’s radius
increases by 5 feet. A creature in the pool of lava (but not in
the geyser) at the start of your turn takes 5d8 fire damage.
When a creature leaves the pool of lava, its speed is
reduced by half and it has disadvantage on Dexterity
saving throws, caused by a hardening layer of lava. These
penalties last until the creature uses an action to break the
hardened stone away from itself.
If you maintain concentration on pyroclasm for a full

You magically remove strong odors from an area, person,

object of up to Large size can be affected. A room full
of garbage or carrion ceases to smell, for example, or
someone sprayed by a skunk no longer bears the odor. If
there is still material producing odors in the area, however,
the smell will return within an hour. If cast upon the area
of a stinking cloud spell, it removes the odor and the spell’s
nauseating qualities, but not the obscuring fog itself.
This spell can also be cast on a single creature of up to
Large size, except for one that already gives off a strong
odor (such as a troglodyte). For the next hour, the creature
has no scent, and it cannot be detected by Wisdom

You trace a glowing black rune in the air which streaks

absorbs the target creature, leaving only the glowing rune
hanging in the space the target occupied. The subject can
take no actions while imprisoned, nor can the subject be
targeted or affected by any means. Any spell durations or
conditions affecting the creature are postponed until the
creature is freed. A dying creature does not lose hit points
or stabilize until freed.
A creature adjacent to the rune can use a move action
to attempt to disrupt its energies; doing so allows the
imprisoned creature to make a Wisdom saving throw. On
a success, this disruption negates the imprisonment and

objects, creatures, spells, and effects that obstruct line
of sight to a range of 30 feet. Inside that distance, the
creature can choose what it perceives as opaque and what
it perceives as transparent as freely and as naturally as it
can shift its focus from nearby to distant objects.
Although the creature can see any target within 30 feet of
itself, all other requirements must still be satisfied before
casting a spell or making an attack against that target.
For example, the creature can see an enemy that has total
cover but can’t shoot that enemy with an arrow because
the cover physically prevents it. That enemy could be
targeted by a geas spell, however, because geas needs only a
visible target.

Choose a beast that you can see within range. If the beast’s
Intelligence is 4 or higher, the spell fails. The beast must
make a Wisdom saving throw; on a failed save, you remove
the shackles of domestication from the creature’s mind,
causing it to entirely forget being broken or trained.
Mounts refuse to be ridden, and other animals forget any
tricks learned and obedience taught. Other memories are
not affected, so creatures might remain drawn to those
who have treated them kindly and aggressive toward those
who have harmed them. The animal can be domesticated
again, but the trainer must start from scratch.
This spell is only partly effective against animal

Description:
You grow a large scorpion’s tail, complete with venomous
stinger. While the spell is in effect, you can use a bonus
action to make a melee attack with the stinger against an
opponent within 5 feet. On a hit, you deal 1d6 piercing
damage and 2d8 poison damage, and the target is
poisoned for 1 minute. A creature hit by your stinger attack
makes a Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, it
takes just half the poison damage and is not poisoned.

Name: STORM FORM
Level: 6
School: Transmutation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self
Components: V, S, M (a piece of wet wool)
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
Description:
You transform into a living storm cloud, becoming a
swirling mass of black clouds illuminated from within by
flickers of lightning.
While in this form, your only method of movement is a
flying speed of 60 feet. You can enter and occupy the space
of another creature. You have resistance to nonmagical
damage, immunity to lightning damage, and advantage on
Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws. If a
creature strikes you with a melee weapon attack, it takes
3d8 lightning damage. You can pass through small holes,
narrow openings, and even mere cracks, but you treat
liquids as if they were solid surfaces. You can’t fall, and you
remain hovering in the air even if stunned or otherwise
incapacitated. You cannot talk or manipulate objects in
storm cloud form, and any objects you were carrying or
holding can’t be used, dropped, or interacted with in any
way. You cannot cast spells while in this form.
As an action, you can attack an opponent up to 30 feet
away, dealing 3d8 lightning damage on a hit. You can also
use an action to bring down rain upon a 5-foot square
within your reach, drenching it and putting out any
nonmagical fires in that area.
Finally, you can use an action to expand your form to
encompass a 20-foot-radius area, unleashing the storm’s
full fury in a burst of rain, wind, lightning, and thunder.
Each creature in the area is drenched with rain, takes 3d8
lightning and 3d8 thunder damage, is deafened for 1d4
rounds, and is knocked prone. A successful Constitution
saving throw halves the damage and negates the deafened
and prone conditions. Taking this action uses up any
remaining duration of the spell, and you resume your
normal form at the end of your turn.

Description:
A powerful wind swirls from your outstretched hand
toward a point you choose within range, where it explodes
with a low roar into vortex of air. Each creature in a
20-foot-radius cylinder centered on that point must make
a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature
takes 3d8 bludgeoning damage, is pulled to the center of
the cylinder, and is thrown 50 feet upward into the air. If a
creature hits a solid obstruction when it’s thrown upward
(such as a stone ceiling), it takes bludgeoning damage as if
it had fallen 50 feet, minus the distance it traveled upward.
For example, if a creature hits the ceiling after rising only
10 feet, it takes bludgeoning damage as if it had fallen 40
feet, or 4d6 bludgeoning damage.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using

You create a storm of spectral birds, bats, or flying insects

range. The storm spreads around corners, and its area
is lightly obscured. Each creature in the storm when it
appears and each a creature that starts its turn in the storm
is affected by the storm.
As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the storm
up to 30 feet. As an action on your turn, you can change
the storm from one type to another, such as from a storm
of bats to a storm of insects.
Bats. The creature takes 4d6 necrotic damage, and its
speed is halved while within the storm as the bats cling to it
and drain its blood.
Birds. The creature takes 4d6 slashing damage, and it has
disadvantage on attack rolls while within the storm as the
birds fly in the way of the creature’s attacks.
Insects. The creature takes 4d6 poison damage, and it
must make a Constitution saving throw each time it casts a
spell while within the storm. On a failed save, the creature
fails to cast the spell, losing the action but not the spell slot.

The sun’s life-giving energy heals and sustains your body
or that of a creature you touch. For the duration, you heal
1 hit point at the start of each of your turns whenever
you are bathed in direct sunlight; 30 minutes or more of
exposure also provides a day’s normal nourishment.
In dim light, the spell’s healing is reduced to 1 hit point
per minute. Normal or magical darkness suppresses
the spell’s effect entirely. While in sunlight, the target
can ignore one level of exhaustion. (The level is only
temporarily removed.)
Undead are especially vulnerable to this spell. If a
targeted undead fails its Wisdom save, it gains the
poisoned condition and suffers radiant damage instead of
healing while in sunlight.

You touch a willing creature and choose one of the
conditions listed below that the creature is currently
subjected to. The condition’s normal effect on the target
is suspended, and the indicated effect applies instead.
This spell’s effect on the target lasts for the duration of
the original condition or until the spell ends. If this spell
ends before the original condition’s duration expires, you
become affected by the condition for as long as it lasts,

Blinded: The target gains truesight out to a range of 10

Paralyzed: The target can use one extra bonus action or

You cause three parallel lines of thick, flared obsidian

it covers a 40-foot-deep pit filled

the tree’s perspective. Trees are particularly attentive to
anything that might harm the forest and always report
such activities when questioned.
If you cast this spell on a tree that contains a creature
that can merge with trees, such as a dryad, you can freely
communicate with the merged creature for the duration
of the spell.

Description:
A golden radiance spreads out from you, providing bright
light up to 30 feet away, and dim light for an additional 30
feet. Any creatures or objects in the area of bright light that
are invisible become visible while they are within 30 feet of
you. Likewise, any magical disguises or illusions within 30
feet of you become feeble and transparent, their illusory
nature obvious. These magical effects return to full potency
if they move more than 30 feet away from you, or vice versa.
When a creature that has taken a different form—
through spells such as polymorph or shapechange, or from
inborn abilities, such as a druid’s wildshape feature—
enters the bright light, it must succeed on a Constitution
saving throw or be forced to return to its original form.
Likewise, a creature attempting to change shape within
the bright light must succeed on a Constitution saving
throw in order to do so.

Until the spell ends, undead creatures within range have

Description:
You cause a stone statue that you can see within 60 feet of
you to animate as your ally. The statue has the statistics of
a stone golem. It takes a turn immediately after your turn.
As a bonus action on your turn, you can order the golem
to move and attack, provided you’re within 60 feet of it.
Without orders from you, the statue does nothing.
Whenever the statue has 75 hit points or fewer at the
start of your turn or it is more than 60 feet from you at
the start of your turn, you must make a successful DC
16 spellcasting check or the statue goes berserk. On each
of its turns, the berserk statue attacks you or one of your
allies. If no creature is near enough to be attacked, the
statue dashes toward the nearest one instead. Once the
statue goes berserk, it remains berserk until it’s destroyed.
When the spell ends, the animated statue reverts to a
normal, mundane statue.

When you cast this spell, your face momentarily becomes
that of a demon lord, frightful enough to drive enemies
mad. Every foe that’s within 30 feet of you and that can
see you must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed
save, a creature claws savagely at its eyes, dealing piercing
damage to itself equal to 1d6 + the creature’s Strength

its next turn and blinded for 1d4 rounds. A creature that

You infuse yourself, and up to four creatures you touch,
with necromantic energy, taking on aspects of the undead.
The targets gain immunity to poison damage and the
poisoned condition for the duration of the spell, and take
on appearances similar to undead versions of themselves.
Undead that encounter a creature under the effect of this
spell must make an Intelligence saving throw against your
spell save DC. On a failed save, the undead mistakes the
target for another undead creature. Typically this means
the undead will ignore the target, especially if it is a less
intelligent one such as a skeleton or a zombie, unless it is
commanded otherwise. The response of more intelligent
undead might depend on the conditions under which the
encounter occurs, but if the target’s presence would not be
unusual, they too might likely ignore the target unless it
acts suspiciously.

Description:
You touch a willing creature and create a shimmering
shield of energy to protect it. The shield grants the target a
+5 bonus to AC and gives it resistance against nonmagical
bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage for the
duration of the spell.
In addition, the shield can reflect hostile spells back
at their casters. When the target makes a successful
saving throw against a hostile spell, the caster of the spell
immediately becomes the spell’s new target. The caster
is entitled to the appropriate saving throw against the
returned spell, if any, and is affected by the spell as if it
came from a spellcaster of the caster’s level.
2nd level transmutation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self
Components: V, S, M (a piece of a tentacle)
Duration: 5 rounds
Your jaws distend and dozens of thin, slimy tentacles
emerge from your mouth to grasp and bind your
opponents. Make a melee spell attack against a foe within
15 feet of you. On a hit, the target takes bludgeoning
damage equal to 2d6 + your Strength modifier and is
grappled (escape DC equal to your spell save DC). Until
this grapple ends, the target is restrained and it takes the
same damage at the start of each of your turns. You can
grapple only one creature at a time.
The Armor Class of the tentacles is equal to yours. If
they take slashing damage equal to 5 + your Constitution
modifier from a single attack, enough tentacles are severed
to enable a grappled creature to escape. Severed tentacles
are replaced by new ones at the start of your turn. Damage
dealt to the tentacles doesn’t affect your hit points.
While the spell is in effect, you are incapable of speech
and can’t cast spells that have verbal components.

Range: 30 feet
Components: V, S, M (100 miniature axes)

Description:
This spell creates a wall of swinging axes from the pile of
miniature axes you provide when casting the spell. The
wall fills a rectangle 10 feet wide, 10 feet high, and 20 feet
long. The wall has a base speed of 50 feet, but it can’t take
the Dash action. It can make up to four attacks per round
on your turn, using your spell attack modifier to hit and
with a reach of 10 feet. You direct the wall’s movement
and attacks as a bonus action. If you choose not to direct
it, the wall continues trying to execute the last command
you gave it. The wall can’t use reactions. Each successful
attack deals 4d6 slashing damage, and the damage is
considered magical.
The wall has AC 12 and 200 hit points, and is immune
to necrotic, poison, psychic, and piercing damage. If it is
reduced to 0 hit points or when the spell’s duration ends,
the wall disappears and the miniature axes fall to the
ground in a tidy heap.

When you cast this spell, you and up to five creatures you
can see within 20 feet of you enter a shifting landscape of
endless walls and corridors that connect to many places
throughout the world.
You can find your way to a destination within 100 miles,
as long as you know for certain that your destination exists
(though you don’t need to have seen or visited it before),
and you must make a successful DC 20 Intelligence check.
If you have the ability to retrace a path you have previously
taken without making a check (as a minotaur or a goristro
can), this check automatically succeeds. On a failed check,
you don't find your path this round, and you and your
companions each take 4d6 psychic damage as the madness
of the shifting maze exacts its toll. You must repeat the
check at the start of each of your turns until you find your
way to your destination or until you die. In either event,
the spell ends.
When the spell ends, you and those traveling with you
appear in a safe location at your destination.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a

additional creatures or travel an additional 100 miles for

Whenever a Large or smaller enemy enters that area of

Description:
You create a 30-foot-radius sphere of roiling wind that
carries the choking stench of death. The sphere is centered
on a point you choose within range. The wind blows
around corners. When a creature starts its turn in the
sphere, it takes 8d8 necrotic damage, or half as much
damage if it makes a successful Constitution saving throw.
Creatures are affected even if they hold their breath or
don’t need to breathe.
The sphere moves 10 feet away from you at the start
of each of your turns, drifting along the surface of the

You create a swirling tunnel of strong wind extending

60 feet long and 10 feet wide. The wind blows from you
toward the end of the line, which is stationary once created.
A creature in the line moving with the wind (away from
you) adds 10 feet to its speed, and ranged weapon attacks
launched with the wind don’t have disadvantage because of
long range. Creatures in the line moving against the wind
(toward you) spend 2 feet of movement for every 1 foot they
move, and ranged weapon attacks launched along the line
against the wind are made with disadvantage.
The wind tunnel immediately disperses gas or vapor, and
it extinguishes candles, torches, and similar unprotected
flames in the line. It causes protected flames, such as those
of lanterns, to dance wildly and has a 50 percent chance of
extinguishing them.

If the target does not escape your grapple, you can use
your action on each subsequent turn to deal 1d10 necrotic

This section includes nearly three dozen new options
for spellcasting types, including the expected wizards,
sorcerers, and warlocks, as well as fifteen new divine
domains, four druid circles, two bard colleges, a pair of
options for paladins and rangers, and even an arcane
fighter. Browse the possibilities and see what inspires your
next magic-slinging character!
Bard CollegeAt 3rd level, a bard gains the Bard College feature. The
following options are available to a bard, in addition to
those in the standard rules.
Bards of the College of Wyrdsingers subscribe to the wyrd,
a philosophy that centers around the phenomenon of the
same name. The wyrd is that which will be, inexorably tied
to such concepts as destiny and fate. Though some might
consider the idea of a fixed destiny fatalistic, the bards of
this college are inspired by this viewpoint. One may not
choose the manner of one’s death, but one can choose how
to meet it, and that idea is at the heart of this college. An
insect might be caught in a spider’s web. Whether it lives or
dies, its struggles ultimately shake the web in its entirety,
and it might free itself through such effort. The struggle
affects all things, however remotely connected they might
be, whereas the insect that merely accepts its death leaves
not even a ripple behind. To confront fate, to embrace the
wyrd and whatever it brings, is to have the power to shake
the world and make it take notice.
When you join the College of Wyrdsingers at 3rd level,
you are already a master of the art of bragging about your
deeds. The fact that you exaggerate is of little importance;
what matters is that boasting of your deeds makes
people listen to you. Your proficiency bonus is doubled
Class Options
when you make a Charisma (Intimidation) or Charisma
(Persuasion) check.
Also beginning at 3rd level, you can use a bonus action
to instill a sense of worth in a single ally within 60 feet
who can hear you. Your ally gains a bonus equal to your
Charisma modifier on attack rolls, damage rolls, ability
checks, and saving throws for a number of rounds equal to
your bard level. That ally cannot benefit from your Bardic
Inspiration until the duration of this feature has run its
course. You can use this feature once at 3rd level, twice
at 8th level, and three times at 15th level. You regain all
expended uses when you finish a long rest.
Additionally, you can use a bonus action to cast any
abjuration spell you know that normally takes 1 action to
cast (for example, laugh in the face of fear, described in this
book, or lesser restoration). Once you use this feature, you
must finish a long rest before you can use it again.
Starting at 6th level, if an ally of yours drops to 0 hit
points, you can use a reaction to expend one of your
uses of Bardic Inspiration. Your ally gains a number of
temporary hit points equal to the die roll and remains
conscious. If the attack that reduced the ally to 0 hit points
would have been fatal, the ally will die if they lose all
temporary hit points they currently possess, unless their
hit point total is raised to 1 or higher before that happens.
At 14th level and higher, you can use an action to sing
a song of valor that enables you to remain courageous
and fight fiercely in the face of the gravest danger. For 1
minute thereafter, you gain immunity to the frightened
condition. Any ally you affect with your Bardic Inspiration
feature also gains this immunity until they expend
the Bardic Inspiration die or the duration expires. In
addition, while this feature is in effect, you add your
Charisma modifier to your weapon damage and to the
damage of any spell you cast.
The Greenleaf College was founded by half-elves who
sought to celebrate their varied heritage. Drawing from
elven lore for inspiration and power, Greenleaf bards
strengthen their connection to nature. Through their
magic and their tales, they convey the rejuvenating
strength of the forests and rivers to their allies.
When you join the Greenleaf College at 3rd level, you gain
proficiency in Nature and two other skills of your choice.
At 3rd level, you learn to infuse your Bardic Inspiration
with a magical seed of healing energy. When a creature uses
a Bardic Inspiration die from you to increase the result of
one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, it also gains
temporary hit points equal to the number rolled on the
Bardic Inspiration die plus your Charisma modifier.
LAND’S STRIDE
Beginning at 6th level, moving through nonmagical
difficult terrain costs you no extra movement. You can also
pass through nonmagical plants without being slowed
by them and without taking damage from them if they
have thorns, spines, or a similar feature. In addition, you
have advantage on saving throws against plants that are
magically created or manipulated to impede movement,
such as those created by the entangle spell.
Starting at 14th level, you can expend one use of Bardic
Inspiration as an action to magically remove one disease
or detrimental condition affecting a creature you can see
within 60 feet. The condition can be blinded, charmed,
deafened, frightened, paralyzed, or poisoned.
Divine DomainsAt 1st level, a cleric gains the Divine Domain
feature. The following domain options are available
to a cleric, in addition to those in the standard rules.
The heady brew of fortitude, courage, and companionship
is your nectar, and you share its blessings with those who
need it.
1st comprehend languages, heroism
3rd blur, bolstering brew*
5th hypnotic pattern, mass healing word
7th confusion, resilient sphere
9th dream, modify memory
* Described in this book
When you choose this domain at 1st level, you learn the
ale-dritch blast cantrip (described in this book). You also
gain proficiency in either Insight or Medicine (your
choice), and you gain proficiency with brewer’s supplies.
Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you
make that uses those supplies.
CHANNEL DIVINITY: BLESSED BREW
Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to
transform a container of nonmagical liquid into blessed
brew; the number of doses equals 3 + your Wisdom
modifier. Any special properties the liquid previously had
are negated. Anyone who imbibes one dose of this brew
can choose one of the following benefits:
• advantage on Charisma-based checks
• a +1 bonus to Armor Class
• a +1 increase to the DC of saving throws against their
castings of enchantment spells
The benefit lasts for 1 hour, leaving behind a warm buzz
when it fades. A creature must finish a short or long rest
before it can again benefit from a dose of blessed brew.
Any blessed brew that is not consumed within an hour
turns into ordinary beer.
CHANNEL DIVINITY: BOOT AND RALLY
Starting at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity
to aid and rally your allies. All friendly creatures within
30 feet of you that are frightened, paralyzed, poisoned, or
stunned gain an immediate saving throw with advantage
to remove the condition. On a succesful save, a creature
also regains 2d6 hit points.
At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon
strikes with radiant energy. Once on each of your turns
when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can
cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 radiant damage to
the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage
increases to 2d8.
At 17th level, you gain resistance to cold, poison, and
psychic damage.
You embody the grace, strength, and resilience of felines.
Eventually, you gain the ability to take the form of a lion or
a tiger.
1st find familiar (feline only),
speak with animals
3rd animal messenger, pass without trace
5th bestow curse, nondetection
7th dimension door, locate creature
9th commune with nature, mislead
When you choose this domain at 1st level, you learn the
true strike cantrip and you gain proficiency in Acrobatics
and Stealth.
CHANNEL DIVINITY: FELINE FINESSE
At 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to add a
+10 bonus to a single Dexterity ability check or Dexterity-
based skill check made by you or someone you designate
within 30 feet. Doing this takes no action on your turn or
a reaction when it’s not your turn. You make this choice
after you see the roll but before the GM says whether the
check succeeds or fails.
Beginning at 6th level, you gain darkvision out to a range
of 60 feet. If you already have darkvision, the range
becomes 90 feet.
At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon
strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns
when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can
cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 damage of the same
type dealt by the weapon to the target. When you reach
14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.
At 17th level, you become a natural lycanthrope. You use
the statistics of a weretiger, though your form can be
that of a werelion, werepanther, wereleopard, or other
large cat, whichever is appropriate for your deity. Your
alignment doesn’t change as a result of this lycanthopy,
and you can’t spread the disease of lycanthropy.
Darkness enshrouds our private affairs and shelters our

* Described in this book
When you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain
proficiency in either Deception or Stealth (your choice).
While in dim light or darkness, you can take the Hide
action as a bonus action.
CHANNEL DIVINITY: SHADOWSIGHT
Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to
gain darkvision out to a range of 60 feet for 1 hour. If you
already have darkvision, using your Channel Divinity in
this way allows you to see in magical darkness to a distance
of 30 feet as if it were dim light.
CHANNEL DIVINITY: SHADOW MELD
Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity
to merge your current location with the version of it that
exists on the plane of shadow. The affected area is a sphere
with a 60-foot radius centered on you. Within that area,
bright light becomes dim light, dim light becomes darkness,
and darkness becomes equivalent to magical darkness.
The temperature plummets; all creatures other than you
in the darkened sphere at the end of their turns must make
a successful Constitution saving throw or take 1d8 cold
damage. The sphere lasts for 1 minute or until you dismiss
it as a bonus action. There’s a chance, if the GM allows, that
2d4 shadows might step through into your world when the
effect ends. Such creatures might or might not be hostile.
At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon
strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns
when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can
cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 necrotic damage to
the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage
increases to 2d8.
At 17th level, your shadow becomes capable of defending
you. Each time you are hit by a nonmagical attack or effect
that causes damage, your shadow absorbs half of the
damage. When your shadow has absorbed damage equal to
one-fourth of your maximum hit points, it goes dormant
until you finish a long rest.
Dragons are known for many marvelous qualities:
mastery of the most unforgiving environments, sagacity,
long life, and an eternal hunger for ever more wealth and
power. Those who worship dragons or the gods of dragons
might strive to emulate several, or perhaps all, of these
qualities themselves.

You also gain advantage on saving throws against being
frightened.
CHANNEL DIVINITY: CHARMER OF REPTILES
Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity
to charm nonintelligent reptiles. As an action, you present
your holy symbol and invoke the name of your deity. Each
reptilian beast within 30 feet of you that can see you must
make a successful Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by
you for 1 minute or until it takes damage. While a reptile is
charmed by you, it is friendly to you and to other creatures
you designate.
CHANNEL DIVINITY: DRAGON’S RESISTANCE
Starting at 6th level, as a reaction when you fail a saving
throw, you can use your Channel Divinity to succeed on
that saving throw instead.
At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon
strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns
when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can
cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 damage of the type
dealt by the weapon to the target. When you reach 14th
level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.
At 17th level, you gain a Frightful Presence action option
similar to a dragon’s. After you use an action to invoke it,
you must finish a short or long rest before using it again.
Frightful Presence. Each creature of your choice that is
within 60 feet of you and aware of you must succeed on a
DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1
minute. A frightened creature repeats the saving throw at
the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on
a success. If a creature’s saving throw is successful or the
effect ends for it, the creature is immune to your Frightful
Presence for the next 24 hours.
You have dedicated your life to the satisfaction of your
appetites, sometimes without regard for others’ needs.
You realize you can never be truly sated, but you also know
that remaining hungry is the key to amassing power.

CHANNEL DIVINITY: FEROCIOUS FEAST
At 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to gain a
bite attack for 1 minute. The bite deals piercing damage
equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier. On a critical hit,
you can add your Wisdom modifier to the damage roll in
addition to the normal benefits.
Beginning at 6th level, you can remove the effect of a
disease, a poison or the poisoned condition, or one level of
exhaustion from yourself as an action. You must finish a
long rest before using this ability again.
At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon
strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns
when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can
cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 necrotic damage to
the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage
increases to 2d8.
At 17th level, you can sacrifice the vitality of those around
you and inspire an insatiable and horrifying hunger in
them. Each living creature within 60 feet of you that fails
a Charisma saving throw takes 10d8 necrotic damage and
then succumbs to a ravening hunger, dropping whatever
it holds and attacking unaffected creatures with their
hands and teeth, or with whatever natural weapons they
possess, in an attempt to devour them. This effect lasts for
a number of rounds equal to 3 + your Wisdom modifier.
An affected creature repeats the saving throw at the end of
each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
You can exclude up to ten creatures from the effect, but
this doesn’t shield them against being attacked by those
who do succumb. This ability doesn’t affect constructs or
the undead.
You are master of the hunt. The bounty of the land is yours
for the taking.

on Stealth checks made to move quietly or to hide. You also
leave no scent. The effect lasts for a number of rounds equal
to your cleric level + your Wisdom modifier.
At 6th level, you can select a favored enemy as if you were
a ranger. You gain all the benefits of the ranger’s Favored
Enemy feature with one exception: you choose additional
favored enemies (and languages) at 10th level and 16th
level instead of at 6th level and 14th level.
At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon
strikes with divine energy. On your turn, you can cause
one successful weapon attack against a creature to deal
an extra 1d8 damage of the type dealt by the weapon to
the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage
increases to 2d8.
At 17th level, you can use an action to describe or name
a creature that is familiar to you or that you can see
within 120 feet. For 24 hours or until the target is dead,
whichever occurs first, you have advantage on Wisdom
(Survival) checks to track your target and Wisdom
(Perception) checks to detect your target. In addition, you
have advantage on weapon attack rolls against the target.
You can’t use this feature again until you finish a short or
long rest.
All seek some form of justice when they have been
wronged, and many live under the promise of its
protection—whether or not the promise is ultimately
kept—but few take on the holy burden of delivering
the justice of the gods. The mercy of the divine, when in
evidence at all, is not the mercy of mortals, and meting out
divine justice makes for a lonely life. Yet someone must
make the sacrifice.

determine the distance in miles to the creature as well as
the direction.
At 6th level, you become immune to the frightened
condition.

the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage
increases to 2d8.
CHANNEL DIVINITY: HOLY DENUNCIATION
At 17th level, you can use your Channel Divinity to
persuade others that you hold divine authority to mete
out justice. You must present your holy symbol and invoke
the name of your deity. As long as your deity is worshiped
openly in the land where you are asserting this authority,
you have advantage on Wisdom checks and Charisma
checks involving justice, judgment, and the law.
The savage and cunning god of the minotaurs has few
followers, but those who heed the call gain the ability to
smash and confound their foes. The Labyrinth domain
grants powers associated with the mazes that minotaurs
love and with misleading enemies. The maze is your holy
temple, and its winding corridors and deadly traps are the
hallmarks of your faith.

CHANNEL DIVINITY:
At 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to gain
advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks for the purpose of
tracking for 1 hour.
Beginning at 6th level, you can make a melee attack that
causes a creature to become confused for 1 round. If
your attack hits, you deal no damage, but the creature is
confused (as the confusion spell) until the start of your next
turn. You expend one use of this ability whether the attack
hits or misses. You can use this ability a number of times
per day equal to 3 + your Wisdom modifier, and you regain
all expended uses when you finish a long rest. This ability
has no effect on minotaurs or on creatures that have a
challenge rating higher than your cleric level.
At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon
strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns
when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can
cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 damage of the same
type dealt by the weapon to the target. When you reach
14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.
At 17th level, you gain the power to banish one creature
you can see within 60 feet to an extradimensional
labyrinth, similar to the effect of the maze spell. The
duration is a number of rounds equal to half your cleric
level, unless you end it early by using a bonus action. The
target resists the effect with a successful Wisdom saving
throw; on a failed save, it is transported into the labyrinth.
The target that was sent to the maze can search for
the exit. On its turn, it uses its action to make a DC 20
Intelligence check; if the check succeeds, the creature
escapes from the labyrinth and returns to its previous
location.
Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you
finish a long rest.
You are an initiate into the quiet mysteries of the moon
and the subtleties of the night. Your faith illuminates any

disadvantage on Stealth checks when you wear medium
armor.
CHANNEL DIVINITY: NIGHT’S CHILL
Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity
to harness moonlight, which banishes magical light and
deals cold damage to your foes. When you present your
holy symbol as an action and use your Channel Divinity,
any magical light within 30 feet of you is dispelled.
Additionally, each hostile creature within 30 feet of you
takes cold damage equal to 2d10 + your cleric level, or half
as much damage with a successful Constitution saving
throw. A creature that has total cover from you is not
affected.
At 6th level, you can emit a nimbus of light in a 30-foot
radius for a number of rounds equal to your cleric level.
This effect acts as a light spell but provides only dim light.
All weapons and ammunition are treated as silvered
while they’re in the aura and for 1 round after leaving it.
Opponents that end their turn in the aura must make a
successful Dexterity saving throw or be limned in silver
light, identical in effect to a faerie fire spell, until the end of
their next turn.
You can use this feature three times, and you regain
expended uses when you finish a long rest.
At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon
strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns
when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can
cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 cold damage to the
target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage
increases to 2d8.
Beginning at 17th level, whenever the moon is visible in
the sky, you can use an action to detect magical pathways,
portals, and gate effects. To be detected, a portal must
be within your line of sight and no farther than 120 feet
from you. Detected portals are visible only to you, but you
can point out their locations to others. Once you use this
feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or
long rest.
Mountains signify strength, endurance, and hard-won
wisdom. Many gods make their homes in the mountains,
and so do many horrors. Those who would know
themselves in full must embrace the ordeal of scaling the
highest peaks, despite the thin, cold air, deprivation, and
hardships that await.

(your choice).
CHANNEL DIVINITY: EVER UPWARD
Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to
grant yourself and up to five other creatures advantage on
skill or ability checks made to climb, avoid falling, or avoid
the prone condition. The effect lasts for 1 hour.
Beginning at 6th level, you gain darkvision out to a range
of 30 feet. If you already have darkvision, you can see in
magical darkness out to a range of 30 feet as if it were dim
light.
At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon
strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns
when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can

target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage
increases to 2d8.
At 17th level, you can create an avalanche that crushes and
buries everything in its path. A 60-foot cone of ice, snow,
and rubble erupts from a point of your choosing within
20 feet of you, in a direction you select. Each creature
in the cone takes 15d8 bludgeoning damage, or half as
much damage with a successful Strength saving throw. A
creature that fails the saving throw is also restrained. A
restrained creature can be freed by spending an action to
make a successful Strength check, either by itself or by an
ally within 5 feet of it.
You must be outdoors to create the avalanche. The
direction of the cone must be downhill or level; the
avalanche can’t flow upill. Walls and other permanent
structures block the avalanche. After using this feature,
you must finish a long rest before using it again.
You invoke the power of salt and sea—the fountain of
life—in all its chaotic glory. You are an emissary between
sea and shore.

to communicate telepathically with aquatic creatures
within 100 feet of you. This ability lasts for 1 hour.

darkvision, its range extends by 30 feet.
At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon
strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns
when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can
cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 cold damage to the
target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage
increases to 2d8.
At 17th level, you become able to breathe in water as easily
as in air. You also gain the ability to transform your skin
into fishlike scales at will. While covered in scales, you have
resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage
from nonmagical weapons, and you have advantage on
Dexterity (Stealth) checks made in natural underwater
environments. You must use an action to grow the scales
or to transform back to your normal skin. The scales can be
any color you choose. The scales need to be kept wet; you
gain one level of exhaustion at the end of each hour when
you have scales and they haven't been thoroughly wetted
for that length of time.
You see the future, whether for good or ill. Eventually, you
might become an oracle renowned across the region.

Beginning at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity
to add 20 feet to your walking speed for a number of
rounds equal to your cleric level.
CHANNEL DIVINITY: FUTURE SIGHT
At 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity to declare
that an action or movement you just performed did not
happen, allowing you to take a different action or make
a different movement. You can do this after the result
of your activity is known, so long as it didn’t result in
your unconsciousness or death. Only a single action or
movement can be nullified. The mixing of future and
present is disorienting, so you gain one level of exhaustion
after using this ability.
At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon
strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns
when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can
cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 damage of the same

14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.

(and controversial) prophet, attracting both loyal followers
and terrible enemies. Consult with your GM to find out
what news, if any, your deity wants foretold.

by engaging in acts of incredible quickness and agility.

CHANNEL DIVINITY: BURST OF SPEED
Beginning at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity
to grant yourself or another creature greater speed. When
you use an action to touch a creature, the target adds 10
feet to its walking speed. It also gains the benefit of a bless
spell, but only on attacks and saving throws that rely on
Dexterity. This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to
3 + your Wisdom modifier.
At 6th level, your speed increases by another 5 feet. Also,
as a reaction or a bonus action, you can increase your
Dexterity modifier by +5 until the end of your current
turn. This benefit can be used for all purposes except
attack rolls. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it
again until you finish a long rest.
At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon
strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns
when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can
cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 damage of the same
type dealt by the weapon to the target. When you reach
14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.

the flow of time. The effect is identical to the time stop
spell; you can take three turns in a row when the effect is
triggered. You must finish a long rest before using this
ability again.
The gods that deal with time are varied. Some see into
the future and past; others deal with the cycles of life
that mark the passage of time—birth and death, the
seasons, or renewal and decay—or have some particular
connection to the timeline, such as gods of creation or
apocalypse do. The clerics of such gods are often granted
powers that allow them to see through or manipulate
time, emulating their deities and enabling them to alter
events as their gods see fit.

that uses either of
those skills.
Additionally, whenever you might be surprised, you can
make a Wisdom saving throw against a DC equal to the
highest result among the enemy’s initiative rolls. On a
successful save, you are not surprised.
CHANNEL DIVINITY: TIME SHIFT

to shift time and alter the order of initiative. As an action,
you can move yourself in the initiative order to any point of
your choosing.
CHANNEL DIVINITY: GROUP TIME SHIFT
Starting at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity to
shift time for others as well as yourself. Choose up to three
allies. When you use your Channel Divinity, you can also
move them in the initiative order to any positions of your
choosing. An allied creature can choose not to be affected.
Beginning at 8th level, you intuitively know where your
enemies will be in the immediate future and how they will
attack. You gain advantage on one attack roll each turn
when you take the Attack action. Alternatively, you can take
a reaction when a creature attacks you to give that creature
disadvantage on its attack roll against you.
At 17th level, you add foresight and time stop to your spell list.
You are never surprised, and whenever you and your allies
might be surprised, you can grant up to six allies the ability
to make Wisdom saving throws to avoid being surprised, as
if they had your Prescient Glimpses feature.
Voyages across oceans, over mountain ranges, through
steaming jungles, and from one world to the next all have
an aspect of the sacred to them. The wisdom, knowledge,
and prosperity gained through furthering one’s experience
of the world also venerates the gods who made such places
and those who watch over such journeys. An agent of one
of these deities might be in some demand as a charm to
help ensure safe travel, though the wise know that the gods
often consider an easy journey to be less beneficial to the
traveler’s spirit.

CHANNEL DIVINITY: REINVIGORATE
Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity
to remove one level of exhaustion from yourself or from
someone else you touch.
Beginning at 6th level, if you are planning to travel any
distance longer than 5 days’ travel and you have a map of
the region to be traversed or firsthand knowledge of the
area, you can find a shortcut. Using the alternate path can
reduce your travel time by 50 percent.
At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon
strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns
when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can
cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 lightning damage to
the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage
increases to 2d8.
At 17th level, you ignore difficult terrain and you gain
resistance to cold and fire damage.
Nearly every part of the world must deal with a change
in temperature and the coming of winter. Nowhere
is this more evident than in the extreme north and
extreme south, where winter is a pervasive part of life.
As civilization expands into inhospitable terrain and
environments, its reliance increases on divine providence
to ensure survivability.
Good-aligned clerics appeal to winter deities such as
Boreas to spare their people the worst of bitter cold,
storms that last for days, and other calamities caused
by weather. They couch the onset of winter as necessary
for strengthening their people and as a respite from toil,
pointing to the peacefulness of the frozen, snow-draped
landscape. Evil clerics embrace the storms and brutal
conditions and even enhance them to advance their
deities’ agendas and to spread fear through their enemies.

CHANNEL DIVINITY: SNOW WALKER
Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity
to grant yourself the ability to walk on the surface of snow,
ignoring any movement penalties that would normally
apply. Ice supports your weight no matter how thin the ice
is, and you can travel on it as if you’re wearing ice skates.
You still leave tracks on snow and ice.
Additionally, in snowy environments, your vision is not
impaired by snow and you have advantage on Dexterity
(Stealth) checks to hide.
Beginning at 6th level, when you deal cold damage to a
creature, it must make a successful Constitution saving
throw against your spell save DC or become stunned until
the end of its next turn.
At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon
strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns
when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can

increases to 2d8.
BRINGER OF WINTER’S WRATH

Creatures other than you inside the snow-filled area have
disadvantage on saving throws against magic that deals
cold damage. The swirling snow lasts for 1 minute or until
you dismiss it as a bonus action.
Druid CirclesAt 2nd level, a druid gains the Druid Circle feature. The
following options are available to a druid, in addition to
those in the standard rules.
There is power in the ancient trees of the world—a quiet,
abiding power. Those who live among trees, like the elves,
are aware of this power, and they treat it with respect,
even reverence. Some druids learn to tap into this power.
These are the members of the Circle of Oaks. By suffusing
themselves with the vitality and strength of the ancient
green, they can perform mighty feats. Although they
commonly hail from the ancient forests of the world,
Circle of Oaks druids can be found anywhere there are
trees of sufficient age from which to draw power.

reappearing in a space of your choice within 5 feet of the
destination tree. You can use this feature twice when you
reach 10th level, and three times at 14th level, when the
range becomes 120 feet. You regain all expended uses
when you finish a long rest.
At 10th level, you can expend two uses of Wild Shape at the
same time to transform into a tree-like humanoid, similar
to a treant, though not as powerful. While in this form, you
are a Large plant, and you have the following statistics:
AC 15 Hit Points 10d10 + 50
Speed 30 ft.
Strength 22 (+6); Dexterity 9 (–1); Constitution 20 (+5)
Damage Resistances bludgeoning, piercing
Damage Vulnerabilities fire
False Appearance While you remain motionless, you are
indistinguishable from a tree.
Multiattack You make two slam attacks.
Slam. Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.
Hit: 14 (2d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage
Rock. Ranged Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, range 60/180 ft., one
target. Hit: 21 (3d10 + 5) bludgeoning damage.
At 14th level, you can use an action on your turn to stir
the trees around you, bringing them to your aid. All
trees within 60 feet of you become animated, their roots
churning the earth and their branches whipping and
slashing. All spaces within 15 feet of a tree are considered
difficult terrain for your enemies, but not for you or your
allies. A creature concentrating on a spell that starts
its turn in one of the affected spaces must succeed on a
Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or
lose concentration on the spell.
Also, you can use a bonus action on your turn to cause
one affected tree to strike a creature within 15 feet of it
with a branch. Make an attack roll, using your spellcasting
ability modifier as a bonus to the roll. On a hit, the creature
takes 4d6 bludgeoning damage. You can use this feature
for a number of rounds equal to your druid level; these
rounds need not be consecutive. You regain the full use of
this feature when you finish a long rest.
If this feature is used underground, beneath an area
where trees grow, the effect is the same, except it is the
trees’ roots that burst through walls into rooms or tunnels,
producing the same effects. If the GM decides the area is
too far underground or is otherwise unsuitable for this
feature to be used, it has no effect.
Druids of the Circle of Owls maintain their tradition
of spying and gathering knowledge and, occasionally,
of permanently silencing those who would misuse
knowledge. The Circle of Owls druids draw on the power
of their namesakes, moving about the world unnoticed as
they see and hear what others try desperately to hide.
The ever-present eyes and ears of the natural world impart
magical knowledge to you. At 2nd level, you learn the
message cantrip. At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th levels, you gain
access to the spells listed for those levels in the Circle of
Owls Spells table.
Once you gain access to a circle spell, you always have
it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of
spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a
spell that doesn’t appear on the druid spell list, the spell is
nonetheless a druid spell for you.
3rd detect thoughts, invisibility
5th nondetection, sending
7th arcane eye, private sanctum
9th modify memory, scrying
When you choose this circle at 2nd level, you gain
proficiency in either Deception or Stealth.
Starting at 2nd level, you can magically evade the notice
of even those who watch you. You can take the Hide
action even when other creatures can see you. If you hide
successfully, you remain hidden in this way until the end of
your next turn (or sooner, if you choose to stop hiding).
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your
Wisdom modifier (minimum of once). You regain all
expended uses when you finish a long rest.
OWL’S EYES
At 6th level, you can cast the clairvoyance spell. When you
cast the spell in this way, you don’t require components,
and the casting time is 1 action. You can choose for the
invisible sensor to instead be visible as the image of an owl.
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you
finish a long rest.
At 10th level, you can slip partially into shadow for a short
time. As an action, you can cast the etherealness spell. When
you cast the spell in this way, its duration is concentration,
up to 1 minute.
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you
finish a short or long rest.
When you reach 14th level, you can disperse your form
into a swirling storm of owls. As an action, you can use
your Wild Shape to become a swarm of owls, which uses
the statistics of a swarm of ravens.
Druids of the Circle of Roses use the power of nature to
influence the minds and hearts of those around them,
alleviating sorrow, spreading terror, and ensnaring hearts
in equal measure. They create sweet and bitter perfumes
that transmit their power to any who inhale the scent.
Your bond with the ebb and flow of nature grants you
knowledge of certain spells. At 2nd level, you learn the
friends cantrip. At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th levels, you gain
access to the spells listed for those levels in the Circle of
Roses Spells table.
Once you gain access to a circle spell, you always have
it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of
spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a
spell that doesn’t appear on the druid spell list, the spell is
nonetheless a druid spell for you.
3rd calm emotions, suggestion
5th hypnotic pattern, tongues
7th confusion, phantasmal killer
9th dominate person, geas
When you choose this circle at 2nd level, you gain
proficiency in Deception, Intimidation, or Persuasion.
Starting at 2nd level, you can expend one use of your
Wild Shape as an action to create a floral perfume that
manipulates the minds of those who breathe it. One
creature of your choice within 10 feet of you must make a
Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC.
On each of your turns while the perfume lasts,
you can use an action to choose a different
creature within 10 feet of you to affect with
your perfume.
On a failed save, the creature is charmed by you
or frightened (your choice) for as long as it remains
in the area of your perfume and for 1 minute after it
leaves the area. If it ends its turn outside the area, the
creature can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect
on itself on a success. If you or your allies attack or
harm a charmed creature, it is no longer charmed.
If the creature’s saving throw is successful or if the
effect ends for it, it is immune to your perfume for the
next 24 hours. A creature that doesn’t breathe or that is
immune to poison is immune to your perfume.
The perfume lasts for 10 minutes or until you use your
Wild Shape again.
At 6th level, your perfume can affect one creature of your
choice within 20 feet of you, and you can use the scent
to offset harmful effects. When you use your Bittersweet
Perfume, you can choose to end one disease or one
condition affecting a creature in your perfume instead of
charming or frightening it. The condition removed can be
charmed, frightened, or poisoned.
ROSE’S THORNS
At 10th level, you can stab thorns at the minds of those
who dare to take you on. When a creature within 20 feet
of you hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction
to force the creature to make a Wisdom saving throw
against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature
takes 1d10 psychic damage.
When you reach 14th level, a whiff of your perfume
surrounds you at all times and lingers in your wake.
You are immune to harmful gases and vapors, you have
advantage on saving throws against becoming charmed or
frightened, and your Bittersweet Perfume now lasts for 1
hour or until you use your Wild Shape again.
In addition, you can intensify the power of your
perfume. When a creature becomes charmed or frightened
from your Bittersweet Perfume, you can use a bonus
action to wrap some of your perfume around it. That
creature is considered to be in the area of your perfume,
no matter how far it moves away from you, for 1 hour or
until you use your Wild Shape again. Once you use this
feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.
Some druids tend to more than the land. They also show
concern for the health of the spirits of the land. Druids
of the Circle of the Spirits build shrines in the wilderness
where they commune with both these spirits and the souls
of the departed.
Starting at 2nd level, you gain the service of a minor spirit
guide. You can cast find familiar as a ritual.
As long as you and your spirit guide (familiar) are within
100 feet of each other, the spirit guide can maintain
concentration on a druid spell you cast. You must choose
whether to do so yourself or make your spirit guide
responsible for maintaining concentration at the moment
the spell is cast, and that decision can’t be changed on a
later turn. You can still have only one concentration spell
in effect at a time; if you concentrate on a different spell
or effect, the spirit guide’s concentration ends. You can
still share your spirit guide’s senses and cast touch spells
through the spirit guide normally while it’s maintaining
concentration. The spirit guide makes Constitution saving
throws to maintain concentration when it takes damage,
not when you take damage.
Your bond with the spirits of nature grants you knowledge
of certain spells. At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th levels, you gain
access to the spells listed for those levels in the Circle of
Spirits Spells table.
Once you gain access to a circle spell, you always have
it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of
spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a
spell that doesn’t appear on the druid spell list, the spell is
nonetheless a druid spell for you.
3rd augury, invisibility
5th speak with dead, spirit guardians
7th divination, hallucinatory terrain
9th antilife shell, scrying
Starting at 6th level, as a bonus action you can engage in a
dance to channel the power of the spirit world. If you cast
a druid spell on your next turn, one target of the spell has
disadvantage on its first saving throw against the spell.
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you
finish a short or long rest.
At 10th level, the spirits rush to your aid when you’re
grievously wounded. When you are reduced to 0 hit points
but not killed outright, you are reduced to 1 hit point
instead. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again
until you finish a long rest.
When you reach 14th level, as an action you can dissolve
your flesh into ectoplasm for up to 1 minute. For the
duration:
• You gain a flying speed equal to your base walking
speed.
• You have resistance to acid, cold, fire, lightning,
thunder, and nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and
slashing damage.
• You can’t be grappled, petrified, knocked prone, or
restrained.
• You can move through creatures and solid objects as
if they were difficult terrain, but you take 1d10 force
damage if you end your turn inside an object.
Maintaining this feature requires concentration as if
it were a spell. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it
again until you finish a short or long rest.
Martial
Archetype
At 3rd level, a fighter gains the Martial Archetype feature.
The following option is available to a fighter, in addition to
those in the standard rules.
The archetypal Prescient Knight is the culmination of
long years of study and dedication to the craft of combat,
supplemented by the use of magic that provides a glimpse
of the future or makes it possible to turn back the hands
of time.
When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain
proficiency in Arcana.
Also at 3rd level, you become able to innately anticipate the
actions of your foes. You can take a second reaction during
a round in which you use your Action Surge.
3rd Bonus Proficiency, Reactive Echo,
Spellcasting, Martial Caster
7th Constant Vigilance
10th Evasion
15th Anticipatory Strike
18th Action Free of Thought
When you reach 3rd level, you augment your martial
prowess with the ability to cast spells.
Cantrips. You learn two cantrips of your choice from
among guidance, quicken (described in this book), and true
strike. You learn the remaining cantrip of the three at 10th
level.
Spell Slots. The Prescient Knight Spellcasting table
indicates how many spell slots you have available for
casting spells. You regain used spell slots when you finish a
long rest.

Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher. You know three
1st-level spells of your choice, all of which you must choose
from the divination and temporal spells on the wizard
spell list.
The Spells Known column of the Prescient Knight
Spellcasting table shows when you learn more wizard
spells of 1st level or higher. You learn additional spells as
you progress; newly learned spells have the same school
and list restrictions as your original spells.
Whenever you gain a level, you can replace one spell you
know with another from among those spells you are able
to learn.
Spellcasting Ability. Intelligence is your spellcasting
ability for your wizard spells. You use your Intelligence
modifier when you make an attack roll with a spell and
when setting the saving throw DC for a spell you cast.
At 3rd level and higher, you can perform somatic
components for your spells while you are wielding a
weapon or a shield, as long as you have proficiency with
those items.
Beginning at 7th level, you have a preternatural awareness
of your surroundings in times of duress. If you are
surprised but not incapacitated at the start of combat,
you can use your Action Surge to negate surprise for
yourself and take a normal turn plus one additional action
(from the Action Surge) in the first round of combat.
Additionally, using your Action Surge in this way allows
you to give sufficient warning to allies who are within 15
feet of you, so they can also start taking reactions after
your turn.
At 10th level, your foreknowledge of events to come allows
you to position yourself in the most advantageous manner.
When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to
make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage,
you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving
throw, and only half damage if you fail.
At 15th level, your innate connection to the threads of fate
strengthens, providing greater insight into the movements
and actions of your opponents. When you use your Action
Surge, you have advantage on attack rolls and a +2 bonus
to your AC until the end of your next turn.
At 18th level, your mastery of divination and temporal
effects is such that you are able to react to your opponents
without conscious thought and with minimal physical
effort. During combat, you can take one reaction every
turn instead of one per round.
Sacred OathsAt 3rd level, a paladin gains the Sacred Oath feature. The
following options are available to a paladin, in addition to
those in the standard rules.
The Oath of Radiance is a beacon in the night, burning
away the corruption of shadow and undeath. Radiant
paladins are bold and brash, abhorring stealth and grandly
striding into battle against the forces of darkness.Paladins
of the Oath of Radiance are overwhelmingly good-aligned,
and most are lawful. Some reject the rigid nature of
knightly orders for the life of a knight errant. Though still
nearly universally good, these wayward paladins are more
neutral than lawful, and they use their relative freedom to
bring their light to bear as they deem it necessary.
Paladins who swear the Oath of Radiance devote
themselves to fighting the insidious powers that darken
mortal hearts and against the undead that extinguish the
light of life and replace it with hungry darkness. Most
important, they take it upon themselves to rescue those
corrupted by shadow or undead influence. They will spare
mortal foes held in the thrall of darkness in the hope that
such creatures can be redeemed.
Cleanse Corruption. I will burn out all creatures born of
darkness, showing no pity or mercy. I will not suffer the
company of dark creatures, save those taken in by darkness
whom I might redeem.
Lead with Light. I stand open and courageous in the face
of battle and will be the last of my companions to quit the
field, just as the last ray of sun leaves the day.
Preserve the Righteous. I will defend those who labor and
live in fear of shadow. I will shield them from harm and
keep the light upon them.
Redeem the Beguiled. Those tempted into the service of
darkness may yet be saved, and I will do everything in my
power to bring them back to the light. I will be discerning
in offering this mercy, but the redemption of the corrupted
is paramount.
Remain Pure. I will never yield to the lies of darkness or
suffer corruption to take me. I will cleanse myself of dark
taint or die before threatening those I defend.
You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed.
3rd guiding bolt, protection from evil and good
5th magic weapon, scorching ray
9th beacon of hope, daylight
13th fire shield, inspiring speech*
17th greater restoration, sun's bounty*
* Described in this book
When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following
two Channel Divinity options.
Dawn’s Radiance. As an action, you present your holy
symbol or a melee weapon, and it flares with the radiance
of the newly risen sun. Magical darkness within 20 feet
of you is dispelled. Thereafter, the object continues to
shine for 1 hour or until you lose possession of it. The
object sheds bright light out to 20 feet and dim light for an
additional 20 feet.
An undead creature, a creature native to the plane of
shadow, or any creature harmed by sunlight (such as a
creature with the Sunlight Sensitivity feature) suffers
pain and disorientation when bathed in this radiance. The
creature has disadvantage on attack rolls and on Dexterity
(Stealth) and Wisdom (Perception) checks while it, the
target of its attack, or anything it is trying to perceive is in
the bright light shed by the holy symbol or weapon.
Turn the Corrupted. As an action, you present your
holy symbol and speak a prayer against the corruptive
power of death and shadow, using your Channel Divinity.
Each undead or creature native to the plane of shadow that
is within 30 feet of you and that can see or hear you must
make a successful Wisdom saving throw or be turned for 1
minute or until it takes damage.
Beginning at 7th level, you and your allies within 10 feet
of you have advantage on saving throws against spells and
effects created by undead creatures and by creatures native
to the plane of shadow. This benefit lasts until someone fails
a saving throw that was made with advantage because of
your Aura of Resolve. Once that happens, you must finish a
short or long rest before you can use this feature again.
At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.
Starting at 15th level, you have resistance to necrotic
damage, and your ability scores and hit point maximum
can’t be reduced by any effect.
At 20th level, as an action, you can suffuse your being
with divine radiance that brings life and burns away dark
corruption. For 1 minute, you gain the following benefits:
• At the start of each of your turns, you regain 10 hit
points.
• Once on your turn when you hit an undead creature or
a creature native to the plane of shadow, it must make a
successful Wisdom saving throw against your spell save
DC or be incapacitated until the end of its next turn.
• An undead creature or a creature native to the plane of
shadow that touches you or hits you with a melee attack
from 5 feet away takes 2d8 radiant damage.
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you
finish a long rest.
Paladins who swear the Oath of Thunder are even more
reserved and humble in daily life than other paladins.
That veneer splits like a thunderclap in battle, when they
erupt as vicious hellions. Indeed, thundering paladins
love to strike “thunder-wise,” meaning suddenly and
with surprise, appearing like a bolt of lightning in their
enemies’ midst before those enemies know what hit them.
Paladins of the Oath of Thunder are often devoted to the
cause of good but care little about the struggle between
law and chaos.
The Oath of Thunder stresses moderation and clear
purpose in daily life, along with crushing, decisive
strikes on the battlefield. Paladins sworn to Thunder see
aberrations and fiends as the ultimate forces of corruption
in the world and strive tirelessly to thwart their designs.
Composure Is My Shield. My deeds are my armor, and
I am not easily provoked. If anyone shall insult me, I
shall laugh at their ignorance. If anyone shall insult my
companions, I shall show them their error.
Crush the Abomination. Twisted creatures from beyond
the world have no place in it. Aberrations and fiends will
feel my blade and know death.
Decisiveness in Battle. When the time for words has
passed, I will strike first to bring a swift end to my enemies.
Duty Above All. Though I drink with the gods and laugh
with the valkyries, I will stand my watch. I will defend my
nation. I will defend my companions.
Humility in Life. I am the Thunder’s servant, not its
master. I will live without excess, assured in my own
strength without ostentation. Charity and courage are
twins.
Voice Like Thunder. My voice rings clear and true in
defense of those who can’t speak out for themselves. I will
speak the truth, because such words echo through the ages.
You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed.
3rd heroism, thunderwave
5th find steed, gust of wind
9th call lightning, thunderclap*
13th freedom of movement, stoneskin
17th not this day!*, rain of blades*
* Described in this book
When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain proficiency
in the Stealth skill.
When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following
two Channel Divinity options.
Storm Strike. As an action, you can use your Channel
Divinity to infuse a ranged or thrown weapon you are
holding with the wrath of a storm god. Make a ranged
weapon attack as normal. In addition to the weapon
attack, you create a line of lightning 5 feet wide and 60
feet long that extends from you straight toward the
target. If the target is less than 60 feet from you, the line
of lightning continues beyond it. Each creature in the
line takes lightning damage equal to 2d10 + your paladin
level, or half the damage with a successful Dexterity saving
throw. If your ranged or thrown weapon attack hits, the
target has disadvantage on its saving throw.
Turn the Unclean. As an action, you present your holy
symbol and utter a war cry, using your Channel Divinity.
Each aberration or fiend within 30 feet of you that can see
or hear you must make a successful Wisdom saving throw
or be turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage.
Beginning at 7th level, you and any allies within 10 feet of
you add your proficiency bonus to initiative rolls.
At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.
Starting at 15th level, when your attack hits a creature that
hasn’t yet taken its first turn in this combat, or when you
hit a creature you were hidden from when you attacked,
that creature has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability
checks, and saving throws until the start of your next turn.
At 20th level, you can take on the aspect of the thunder
god. While at rest, you have the gloomy demeanor of a
thundercloud. When you go into action, your clothing
and hair blow wildly in a wind that arises from nowhere,
your eyes flare with lightning, and your voice booms like
thunder.
By using an action, you undergo a transformation. For 1
hour, you gain the following benefits:
• You don’t have disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth)
checks because of armor.
• You have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks and
initiative rolls.
• Your weapon attacks deal an extra 1d10 lightning or
thunder damage (your choice when you hit).
• As an action, you can unleash a terrifying war cry.
Every enemy creature in a 30-foot cone must make a
successful Wisdom saving throw or become frightened
of you for 1 minute. While frightened in this way, the
creature must spend its turn trying to move as far away
from you as it can. It can’t take reactions. On this turn,
the creature can do nothing other than take the Dash
action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it
from moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature
can use the Dodge action. A frightened creature that’s
more than 30 feet from you and can’t see you repeats
the saving throw at the start of its turn, ending the
effect on itself on a success. A creature that succeeds
on its saving throw can’t be affected by your war cry for
24 hours.
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you
finish a long rest.
Ranger
ArchetypesAt 3rd level, a ranger gains the Ranger Archetype feature.
The following options are available to a ranger, in addition
to those in the standard rules.
Elves of the forested woodlands and mountain foothills
often uphold the tradition of taming and riding griffons,
living on the same windswept crags where griffons nest,
thus giving themselves the ability to command vast tracts
of woodland territory. Trained by elf veterans and beast
tamers, rangers of the Griffon Scout archetype learn
to move swiftly and stealthily both on foot and while
mounted, gathering information on their enemies and
mounting devastating hit-and-run raids with precision
and coordination.
Starting at 3rd level, you learn an additional spell when
you reach certain levels, as shown in the Griffon Scout
Spells table. These spells count as ranger spells for you, but
they don’t count against the number of ranger spells you
can know.
3rd feather fall
5th find steed
9th haste
13th greater invisibility
17th telepathic bond
Also starting at 3rd level, you have advantage on Dexterity
(Stealth) checks while mounted, and your Dexterity
(Stealth) checks apply to both you and your mount.
SKIRMISHER’S STEP
Beginning at 3rd level, when you move at least 20 feet
straight toward a creature and hit it with a melee weapon
attack in the same turn, that attack deals an extra 1d8
damage of the same type dealt by the weapon to the target.
If you move out of the target’s reach before the end of your
next turn, whether you are mounted or not, you don’t
provoke an opportunity attack from the target.
Starting at 7th level, you can deliver punishing flurries
of attacks in perfect coordination with your allies. When
one of your allies hits a target within 30 feet of you with
an attack, you can use your reaction to make one weapon
attack against that target.
At 11th level, when you cast find steed, you can choose for
your steed to take the form of a griffon, though it is a fey
instead of a monstrosity.
Starting at 15th level, when you move at least 20 feet
during your turn, whether you are mounted or not, you
become an evasive blur. Until the start of your next turn,
a creature that attacks you has disadvantage on the first
attack roll it makes against you or your mount.
Vampire slayers wander remote forests, haunted hills, and
fog-bound moors, protecting the common folk of farming
villages and cabins at the edge of civilized lands from the
creatures of the night. Moving unseen through woodlands,
your specialized training allows you to hunt vampires,
ghouls, werewolves, and other monsters that prey on the
innocent. Although you are most at home in the wilderness,
as your skills improve, your attention might turn to older
vampires that rule entire baronies, or that command dark
keeps and sprawling manors closer to civilization.
If you choose this archetype at 3rd level, your favored
enemy becomes undead if you did not select undead at 1st
level. When you choose additional favored enemies at 6th
and 14th level, you can choose freely from the standard
list, and you can also select hags or lycanthropes as an
alternative.
HUNTER’S PREY
At 3rd level, you gain one of the following features of your
choice: either Colossus Slayer, Giant Killer, or Horse
Breaker from the Hunter archetype in the standard rules,
or Empowered Strike, which is described below.
Empowered Strike. Your expertise in fighting undead and
lycanthropes allows you to harm them even when you’re
not wielding a magic weapon. When you fight a creature
that has resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing
damage from nonmagical weapons, you can ignore this
resistance once per turn when you score a hit with a
nonmagical weapon. If you are wielding a magic weapon,
the creature takes an extra 1d8 damage from one of your
successful attacks on each of your turns.
At 7th level, you gain one of the following features of your
choice: either Escape the Horde, Multiattack Defense, or
Steel Will from the Hunter archetype in the standard rules,
or Ranger's Resilience, which is described below.
Ranger’s Resilience. You have advantage on saving throws
against paralysis and against effects that would reduce your
hit point maximum.
SLAYER’S STRIKE
At 11th level, you gain one of the following features of your
choice: either Volley or Whirlwind Attack from the Hunter
archetype in the standard rules, or Straight Through the
Heart, which is described below.
Straight Through the Heart. When you use an attack
action, you can choose to make a single melee attack
against a favored enemy in an effort to strike a vulnerable
spot. If the attack hits, it deals an extra 6d6 damage.
SUPERIOR HUNTER’S DEFENSE
At 15th level, you gain one of the following features of your
choice: either Evasion, Stand Against the Tide, or Uncanny
Dodge from the Hunter archetype in the standard rules, or
Greater Resilence, which is described below.
Greater Resilience. You have advantage on saving throws
against the spells and abilities of your favored enemies.
Sorcerous
OriginsAt 1st level, a sorcerer gains the Sorcerous Origin feature.
The following options are available to a sorcerer, in
addition to those in the standard rules.
Your innate magic comes from your superior bloodline.
Your magic wells up from within you, as a paragon of
your race. Whether you come from a long line of storied
ancestors, or you are simply the product of a chance
blending of the best characteristics of your race, you were
born exceptional, and your sorcerous power is a testament
to your legacy.
At 1st level, you have a natural affinity for a particular
school of magic, depending on your race, as shown on
the table below. You can cast a particular spell from
that school without needing material components, and
that bonus spell does not count against your number of
sorcerer spells known. You regain the use of your bonus
spell when you finish a long rest.
Dwarf Transmutation feather fall
Dragonborn Evocation burning hands
Elf Enchantment hideous laughter
Gnome Illusion illusory script
Half-elf Divination identify
Half-orc Necromancy false life
Halfling Abjuration alarm
Human Any one one from chosen school
Tiefling Conjuration floating disk
When your Spellcasting feature lets you learn a new
sorcerer cantrip or a new sorcerer spell of 1st level or
higher, you can choose the new spell from the wizard spell
list, as long as the spell is from your associated school.
Also starting at 1st level, you can absorb a certain amount
of hostile magical energy. You can use this feature as a
reaction when you make a successful saving throw against
a spell of a level that is no higher than your sorcerer level.
When you do so, you absorb the magical energy of the
attack. Instead of being affected by the spell, you regain
a number of expended spell slots equal to the level of the
spell. If you have not used any spell slots for a given level
of spell, this feature does not allow you to gain a slot that
would exceed your normal maximum.
For example, if you are a 3rd-level sorcerer and make a
successful save against a 2nd-level spell, you can regain
two 1st-level spell slots or one 2nd-level spell slot.
If you don’t have two available 1st-level spell slots,
you must regain the 2nd-level slot. If you have
one available 1st-level spell slot and no 2nd-level
slots, you regain one 1st-level slot
when you use this feature.
You can regain a number of expended spell slots equal to
twice your sorcerer level. Once you regain all the expended
slots provided by this feature, you must finish a short or
long rest before you can use the feature again.
Starting at 6th level, you can more easily enhance spells
affiliated with your associated school. If you apply a
Metamagic option to a spell from that school, it costs 1
less sorcery point. If the option normally costs 1 sorcery
point, it costs 1/2 point for you.
At 14th level or higher, you can spend 4 sorcery points to
infuse yourself with power, showing all the elite power
of your bloodline. For 1 minute afterward, you double
your proficiency bonus on any Charisma-based checks
made against others of your race, and you have advantage
on those checks. Any creatures not of your race have
disadvantage on saving throws against spells you cast.
Additionally, you add your Charisma bonus to the damage
of any spells you cast. Once you use this feature, you must
finish a long rest before you can use it again.
Starting at 18th level, you can make one of your spells
more effective if you spend 2 sorcery points when you
cast it. If the spell deals damage, you can roll twice for
damage and use the higher result. If the spell does not deal
damage, the targets of the spell have disadvantage on the
saving throw against it.
Your innate magic arises from elemental power suffused
into your being. You might have an elemental creature,
such as genie, in your ancestry. Perhaps you lived most of
your life near a portal to one of the Elemental Planes, and
the ambient magic of the plane saturated everything you
ate and drank. Perhaps a magical conjuring went awry,
and the essence of an elemental merged with your own.
Whatever the ultimate source, you are a walking conduit
to an elemental plane.
At 1st level, choose one element from the Elemental
Heritage table. You can speak, read, and write the language
associated with your heritage, and its damage type is used
by features you gain later.
Air Auran Lightning or thunder
(choose one)
Earth Terran Bludgeoning
Fire Ignan Fire
Water Aquan Cold
Starting when you choose this origin at 1st level, you are
able to channel your elemental power into a swirling aura.
As a bonus action, you can surround yourself in a magical
aura of elemental material or energy appropriate to your
heritage element for 1 minute. While the aura persists, you
gain the following benefits:
• When you are attacked, you can use your reaction to
impose disadvantage on the attack roll.
• When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher, the aura
around you intensifies until the start of your next turn.
During this time, any creature that ends its turn within
5 feet of you or that enters that area takes 1d6 damage
of the type associated with your heritage element. This
damage increases to 2d6 when you reach 7th level.
You can use this feature twice. You regain all expended
uses when you finish a long rest.
Starting at 6th level, you gain resistance to the damage
type associated with your heritage.
Additionally, when you damage a creature with a spell,
you can spend 1 sorcery point to enhance it with the
power of your heritage element. The spell takes on a visual
cast that reflects the elemental infusion (fire and embers
dance in the area, wind swirls around a bolt of energy,
and so forth) and delivers the following additional effects
depending on your heritage:
• Air. The creature is buffeted by strong winds, arcs of
lighting, and claps of thunder. It can’t take reactions
until the start of its next turn.
• Earth. The creature is restrained until the start of your
next turn.
• Fire. The creature is seared by your fiery magic. It is
frightened until the end of its next turn. Creatures that
are immune to fire are unaffected.
• Water. The creature is disoriented as the world seems
to roll and pitch in waves. It is poisoned until the end of
its next turn.
At 14th level, you can teleport by skimming the outer
boundary of the Elemental Planes. As a bonus action,
you can magically teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied
space you can see. When you appear, you can create one of
the following effects, depending on your heritage element:
• Air. When you appear within 5 feet of an area of wind
(whether natural or magical), you create a cyclonic
burst of wind. All creatures within 10 feet of you must
succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 2d6
slashing damage and be blinded by dust and debris
until the start of your next turn.
• Earth. When you appear within 5 feet of nonmagical,
unworked stone filling at least one 5-foot square,
you create tremors in the earth that ripple outward
from you. Each creature within 10 feet of you that is
touching the ground must succeed on a Strength saving
throw or take 4d6 bludgeoning damage and fall prone.
• Fire. When you appear within 5 feet of a fire at least the
size of a campfire, you create a burst of flame around
yourself. Each creature within 10 feet must succeed on
a Dexterity saving throw or take 2d6 fire damage and
catch on fire. Until a creature takes an action to douse
the fire, a creature on fire takes 1d6 fire damage at the
start of each of its turns.
• Water. When you appear within 5 feet of at least 50
gallons of water, you create a torrent of water that
assails the creatures around you. Each creature within
10 feet of you must succeed on a Constitution saving
throw or take 2d6 bludgeoning damage and choke on
the water that forces its way into the creature’s throat.
A choking creature can’t speak and has disadvantage
on attack rolls and ability checks until the start of your
next turn. Creatures that don’t have to breathe or that
can breathe water aren't subject to choking.
Saving throws against these effects are made against your
spell save DC. You can use this feature twice. You regain all
expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.
At 18th level, you gain immunity to the damage type
associated with your heritage element.
Depending on your elemental heritage, you also gain one
of the following benefits:
• Air. You gain a magical flying speed equal to your
current walking speed. Additionally, during your turn
you can spend 1 sorcery point to become insubstantial
wind and mist. Until the start of your next turn, you
can enter a hostile creature’s space, you can move
through a space as narrow as 1 inch without squeezing,
you are immune to the effects of strong wind, and you
have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing
damage from nonmagical attacks.
• Earth. You gain a burrowing speed equal to your
current walking speed, and you can burrow through
nonmagical, unworked earth and stone. While doing
so, you don’t disturb the material you move through.
Additionally, you can spend 1 sorcery point to become
stony and unyielding until the start of your next turn.
During this time, you have resistance to piercing and
slashing damage, you are immune to poison damage,
and you can’t be petrified or poisoned.
• Fire. Your speed increases by 10 feet. Additionally,
during your turn you can spend 1 sorcery point to
become fiery and insubstantial. Until the start of your
next turn, you can move through a hostile creature’s
space. The first time you enter a creature’s space on a
turn, that creature takes 1d10 fire damage and catches
on fire. Until a creature takes an action to douse the
fire, a creature on fire takes 1d10 fire damage at the
start of each of its turns.
• Water. You gain a swimming speed equal to your
current walking speed, and you can breathe both water
and air. Additionally, during your turn you can spend 1
sorcery point to take on a watery form. Until the start of
your next turn, you can enter a hostile creature’s space
and move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide
without squeezing. When you enter a hostile creature’s
space, the creature must succeed on a Strength saving
throw against your spell save DC or fall prone.
Your magic comes from a god of prophecy and
prognostication who imbued a sliver of their power in
your ancestry. Farseers can trace their power through the
generations to a single, powerful ancestor whose divine
gift gave them access to the webs of fate. Some are plagued
by visions and omens, having no knowledge of their august
lineage. These unfortunate individuals might be driven
to madness and ostracized because of their uncontrolled,
forbidden knowledge. Regardless, the touch of the divine
has forever changed you, and the skeins of fate unravel in
your view.
When you choose this origin at 1st level, the blood of your
ancestors signals your destiny. You gain proficiency in
Insight and History. Your preternatural sense of what is
to come also allows you to sense imminent danger, so you
make initiative rolls with advantage.
Starting at 1st level, you can take the Dodge action as a
bonus action on your turn. You use this feature a number
of times equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum
of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a
short or long rest.
When you reach 6th level, your prophetic insight allows
you to commune with otherworldly powers. By focusing
all your attention on a single yes-or-no question for
1 minute, you can pose that question to the powers
beyond. The entity that responds to your question has
vast knowledge, but it isn’t omniscient; it can predict only
what might happen, not what’s certain to occur. Questions
about the future must be phrased in terms of what’s
possible or plausible to avoid nonanswers. You must finish
a short or long rest before using this feature again.
When you reach 14th level, the skeins of time enshroud
your body, distorting the fabric of reality around you. As
an action, you can expend 3 sorcery points to step out of
sync with the current timeline. You can be seen only as an
indistinct, shimmery outline. Attacks against you are made
with disadvantage, and you have resistance to bludgeoning,
piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical weapons.
Additionally, you can move through other creatures and
solid objects as if they were difficult terrain. If you end your
turn inside a solid object, you take 1d10 force damage and
are expelled into the nearest open space.
The effect lasts for up to 1 minute, provided you maintain
concentration on it as on a spell.
At 18th level, visions of likely futures constantly
weave across your consciousness. You can share that
foreknowledge with your companions. As an action, you
can grant up to five creatures (which can include yourself)
advantage on attack rolls or saving throws—each creature
chooses for itself—for up to 1 minute, provided you
maintain concentration on this effect as on a spell. You
must expend 2 sorcery points per affected creature to
trigger this effect.
Otherworldly
PatronsAt 1st level, a warlock gains the Otherworldly Patron
feature. The following options are available to a warlock,
in addition to those in the standard rules.
You have made a pact with a powerful ruler of geniekind
on one of the Elemental Planes. The Genie Lord’s
concerns encompass a myriad of topics, ranging from
those inscrutable to the mortal mind to those that
are simple and straightforward. Genie lords compete
endlessly against each other, and rivalries between these
elemental rulers can engulf entire nations. They aren’t
above bribing a rival’s mortal agents to switch sides if they
think it will gain them an advantage.
The Genie Lord lets you choose from an expanded list of
spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells
are added to the warlock spell list for you.
1st thunderwave, wind tunnel*
2nd gust of wind, sleet storm
3rd protection from energy, water breathing
4th conjure minor elementals, fire shield
5th creation, wall of stone
* Described in this book
GENIE LORD’S FAVOR
Starting at 1st level, you can speak, read, and write
Primordial. You can understand and be understood by any
creature that speaks Auran, Ignan, Terran, or Aquan.
Additionally, your patron grants you a token that can
absorb elemental power. You gain a magical gemstone
with the following properties:
• You can use the gem as an arcane focus.
• The gem can capture elemental power. When you take
acid, cold, fire, lighting, or thunder damage, you can
choose to transfer some or all of the damage into the
gem instead of taking the damage yourself. The gem
can absorb damage equal to twice your warlock level
+ twice your Charisma modifier. The gem becomes
empty again when you finish a long rest.
• While the gem holds any amount of elemental power,
you can use an action to cause it to shed bright light out
to 20 feet and dim light for an additional
20 feet, to shed dim light out to 5 feet, or to
douse the light.
If you lose your token, you can perform
a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement
from your patron. This ceremony can be
performed during a short or long rest, and it
destroys the previous token. Your token shatters to
slivers when you die.
Starting at 6th level, you can use the energy stored in your
token against foes. When you damage a target with any
kind of attack, you can spend stored points to deal extra
damage of the same type equal to your Charisma bonus.
If you deal damage to multiple targets with a single attack,
choose which one takes the extra damage.
Additionally, you can extend the protection of your gem
to other creatures. When an ally within 30 feet that you
can see takes acid, cold, fire, lighting, or thunder damage,
you can use your reaction to transfer some of the damage
into your gem.
Starting at 10th level, you can call upon your Genie Lord
to twist fate in your favor. Immediately after you make an
attack roll, saving throw, ability check, or damage roll, you
can choose to reroll and take the better result.
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you
finish a short or long rest.
HERALD’S ASPECT
Starting at 14th level, you can channel the power of your
patron into your flesh to magically transform into a herald
of your Genie Lord. Your legs fade away into a swirl of
elemental energy, and your skin and features take on a cast
that resembles that of your patron. You can transform as
a bonus action, and the transformation lasts for 1 minute,
during which you gain the following benefits:
• You gain a flying speed of 60 feet.
• You have advantage on saving throws against spells and
other magical effects.
• Choose one of the following damage types: acid, cold,
fire, lightning, or thunder. You gain immunity to that
damage type.
• Once on your turn when you hit with any attack, you
can deal an extra 3d6 damage of one of the following
types: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder.
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you
finish a short or long rest.
THE GENIE LORD'S PACT BOONS
The pact boons bestowed by the Genie Lord are modified
or augmented as described below. Add these details to
whichever pact boon you select.
Your pact weapon takes on a sheen of elemental power.
When you create or summon your pact weapon, you can
choose its damage type to be one of the following: acid,
cold, fire, lightning, or thunder. You can select a different
damage type each time you create the weapon.
When you conjure your familiar or change its form, you
can choose the form of a mephit in addition to the usual
alternatives. When you use your action to command your
mephit familiar to attack, it can use its breath or its Innate
Spellcasting if you so desire.
Your book is immune to damage or wear caused by the
elements. This includes acid, cold, fire, lightning, or
thunder damage, as well as simple effects such as being
immersed in water or set aflame.
You have made a pact with the Sibyl, a divine being
associated with prophecy, knowledge, and fate. Your
patron guides you through visions, portents, and periods
of ecstatic clarity to act on its behalf and to further its
stratagems. Your relationship to your patron is different
from that of its clergy. You are not asked for faith, worship,
or adulation; instead, you serve solely through your
actions and influence in the world. Because of that, you
might have a strained relationship with the deity’s most
dedicated priests and other zealots.
The Sibyl lets you choose from an expanded list of spells
when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are
added to the warlock spell list for you.
1st alarm, seer’s reaction*
2nd augury, blindness /deafness
3rd bestow curse, clairvoyance
4th confusion, divination
5th eidetic memory*, legend lore
* Described in this book
Starting at 1st level, you are driven to ecstatic gibbering
and utterances because of your connection to your
patron. Your prophetic commentary, startling insights,
and frenetic appearance are unsettling, distracting,
and psychically damaging to your target. Although the
manifestation is different, this effect functions the same as
the vicious mockery cantrip.
Additionally, you have proficiency in Performance, and
your proficiency bonus is doubled on ability checks you
make using that skill.
Starting at 6th level, you can direct your patron to
infiltrate and overwhelm your target’s psyche with
knowledge of failures in the target’s immediate future. As
an action, designate a creature within 60 feet that can see
and hear you. It must make a successful Charisma saving
throw or be stunned until the end of your next turn.
After using this feature, you can’t use it again until you
finish a short or long rest.
When you reach 10th level, the voices in your mind become
clearer and more focused. They bolster your mindfulness of
your surroundings and grant you a preternatural awareness
of creatures that mean you harm. While you are wearing
light armor or no armor, you can add your Charisma
modifier (minimum of 1) to your Armor Class.
Starting at 14th level, when you deal psychic damage
to a target, you can also inundate it with frenetic and
discordant voices of doom. The awful truths revealed to
the target cause it to take an extra 8d10 psychic damage,
and it is affected as if by a confusion spell until the end of its
next turn.
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you
finish a long rest.
THE SIBYL'S PACT BOONS
The pact boons bestowed by the Sybil are modified or
augmented as described below. Add these details to
whichever pact boon you select.
Your weapon is usually, but not always, the weapon
favored by your patron. When you create or summon your
pact weapon, you can choose whether it deals damage of
its usual type or psychic damage.
Your patron grants you a special familiar, a giant moth
(Creature Codex, p. 178), to aid you.
Your tome is an illuminated manuscript with depictions of
prophets foretelling events to come. As your adventuring
career progresses, new illuminations appear in the book’s
pages, recording your notable acts in the service of your
patron. While this book is on your person, your passive
Perception score is increased by 1 when being contested by
an enemy's Stealth check.
Arcane
TraditionAt 2nd level, a wizard gains the Arcane Tradition feature.
The following options are available to a wizard, in addition
to the options in the standard rules.
You concentrate your arcane studies on the power
inherent to one of the Elemental Planes.
Elementalists believe in the superiority of their chosen
element above all others, and they aren’t shy about making
that fact known. Elementalists are sometimes secluded
researchers, but more often they’re adventurous types
who sign on with groups that can appreciate their singular
talents.
Beginning when you select this specialty at 2nd level,
choose one element from the table below. That element
becomes the focus of your study. You can speak, read, and
write the language associated with your focus element,
and the associated damage type is used by other features
as noted.
Air Auran Lightning or thunder
(choose one)
Earth Terran Bludgeoning
Fire Ignan Fire
Water Aquan Cold
Some spells are associated with your focus element. The
gold and time you must spend to copy a spell associated
with your chosen element into your spellbook is halved.
The spell list for each focus element is given below. Spells
marked with an asterisk appear in this book.
FOCUS ELEMENT: AIR
Cantrips—shocking grasp, wind lash*
1st level—fog cloud, thunderwave, wind tunnel*
2nd level—gust of wind, rolling thunder*

3rd level—frozen razors*, riptide*, sleet storm
4th level—conjure minor elementals, control water
5th level—cone of cold, conjure elemental, frostbite*
6th level—drown*, freezing sphere, wall of ice
* Described in this book
Starting at 2nd level, you learn techniques called masteries
to channel elemental magic into your being and your spells.
Masteries. You learn two masteries of your choice,
which are detailed under “Masteries” below. You learn one
additional mastery of your choice at 6th, 10th, and 14th
levels. Each time you learn a new mastery, you can also
replace one mastery you know with a different one.
Beginning at 6th level, you can funnel elemental essence
through your damage-dealing spells. When you cast a spell
that deals damage, you can change the damage to the type
associated with your focus element.
Starting at 10th level, when you would take damage of
the type associated with your focus element, you can use
a reaction to take no damage and regain a number of hit
points equal to half the damage you would have taken. You
can use this feature even if you have resistance or immunity
to that damage type from another source. You can use
this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence
modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses
when you finish a long rest.
At 14th level, your elemental damage spells are
unstoppable. Your spells that deal damage of the type
associated with your focus element ignore immunity to that
damage type. You can use this feature a number of times
equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once). You
regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
Masteries are specialized techniques you can use to
augment your spellcasting. Unless noted otherwise, you
can use only one mastery on a given spell. The masteries are
presented in alphabetical order.
Prerequisite: 14th level
You add plane shift to your spellbook if you don’t already
have it, and you can cast it once with this mastery without
expending a spell slot. You can travel only to the elemental
plane associated with your focus element, or to the
Material Plane. While you are on the elemental plane,
you aren’t harmed by the normal conditions of the plane,
you can breathe normally, and you can use your speed to
move in a manner appropriate to the plane (flying for air,
burrowing for earth, and swimming for water). You regain
the ability to cast plane shift with this mastery when you
finish a long rest.
Prerequisite: 10th level
You add planar binding to your spellbook if you don’t
already have it, and you can cast it once with this mastery
without expending a spell slot. When you cast the spell in
this way, you must target an elemental creature associated
with your focus element. If the elemental fails its saving
throw, it gains temporary hit points equal to your wizard
level. You regain the ability to cast planar binding with this
mastery when you finish a long rest.
Prerequisite: 6th level
You gain resistance to the damage type associated
with your focus element, and you have advantage
on Constitution saving throws made to maintain
concentration on spells that involve your focus element.
As an action, you can charm an elemental creature for as
long as you maintain concentration as if concentrating on
a spell, for up to 1 hour. If you or your companions damage
the charmed elemental or take any harmful action against
it, the charmed condition ends immediately. When this
condition ends for a given elemental, it is immune to being
charmed by you for 24 hours.
Prerequisite: 10th level
After you damage a target with a spell that deals the
damage type associated with your focus element, the target
gains vulnerability to that damage type until the end of
your next turn. You can use this feature twice. You regain
all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.
Prerequisite: Elemental focus (fire)
When you deal fire damage to a target with a spell of
1st level or higher, you can use a bonus action to cause
the target to catch fire. At the start of its next turn, the
creature takes half as much fire damage as it originally
took from the spell, and the flames go out. This damage
can be prevented if an ally within 5 feet uses an action to
put out the flames. If you damage more than one target
with the spell, choose just one to catch fire.
Prerequisite: 14th level
When you damage a creature with a spell of 1st level or
higher that deals the damage type associated with your
focus element, you can weave a lingering aura of elemental
energy around the target. At the start of its turn, the
creature must make a Constitution saving throw. On a
failed save, it takes 4d6 damage of the type dealt by the
spell and is stunned until the start of its next turn. On a
successful save, it takes half the damage and the effect ends.
You can use this feature twice. You regain all expended
uses when you finish a short or long rest.
Prerequisite: Elemental focus (earth)
When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher, you can use
a bonus action to create a hovering slab of stone that
interposes itself between you and one creature of your
choice within 60 feet. Until the end of your next turn, the
slab provides half cover to you against attacks from the
chosen creature.
Prerequisite: Elemental focus (water)
When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher, you can use
a bonus action to create a sweeping wave of water that
drenches a target you can see within 20 feet. The creature
must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed 5
feet in the direction of your choice.
Prerequisite: Elemental focus (air)
When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher, you can use
a bonus action to create a line of wind 20 feet long and 5
feet wide. Each creature in the line must make a successful
Strength saving throw or take 1d6 slashing damage and be
pushed 10 feet away from you in the direction of the line.
An enlightened few wizards know that true mastery of life
and death requires understanding of the uneasy balance
between life, death, and undeath—the necromantic triad.
You don’t walk the same path as traditional
users of necromantic magic, which your
order refers to as “dark necromancers.”
You have profound respect for life’s
eternal cycle and use the power you have
accumulated to honor the dead and aid
the living.
Restriction: Non-Evil. You can choose
this wizard specialty only if you have an
alignment that isn’t evil.
Beginning when you select this specialty at 2nd level, the
gold and time you must spend to copy a necromancy spell
into your spellbook is halved.
At 2nd level, you gain proficiency in Medicine and
Religion if you don’t already have it, your proficiency
bonus is doubled for Wisdom (Medicine) checks, and
you have advantage on Intelligence (Religion) checks to
recall lore about deities of death, burial practices, and the
afterlife. In addition, you learn the spare the dying cantrip,
which is a wizard cantrip for you and doesn’t count against
the number of wizard cantrips you know.
Also starting at 2nd level,
you can use an action to
heal a creature you can
touch. The creature
regains hit points equal
to your Intelligence
modifier + your wizard level
(minimum of 1). This feature can restore a creature to no
more than half its hit point maximum. Once a creature has
regained hit points from this feature, it can’t do so again
until it finishes a long rest.
At 6th level, you add the animate dead spell to your
spellbook if it is not there already. When you cast this spell,
it has additional effects:
• If the undead creature has an Intelligence score of 5
or lower, its Intelligence becomes 6, and it gains the
ability to understand and speak one language of your
choice that you speak.
• The undead creature’s alignment is the same as yours.
• At the end of the undead creature’s first 24 hours of
serving you, it might continue to serve you for another
24 hours or else return to its eternal rest. You can
convince the undead creature to continue serving you
with a successful Charisma (Persuasion) check against
a DC equal to 8 + the creature’s challenge rating. On
a successful check, the creature remains under your
control, and the DC of the next check you make to
maintain control 24 hours later increases by 1. You have
disadvantage on this check if you were disrespectful to
the creature in the previous 24 hours. On a failed check,
or if you choose not to maintain control, the undead
creature immediately crumbles to dust.
When you reach 11th level, you add the create undead
spell to your spellbook. All of the above effects also apply
whenever you cast that spell.
At 10th level, you add the warding bond spell to your
spellbook, and it is a wizard spell for you. You can cast
warding bond without expending a spell slot or requiring
the material component, and the spell’s duration increases
to 4 hours.
Once you cast warding bond in this way, you can’t do so
again until you finish a long rest. You can still cast warding
bond normally using an available spell slot.
Once you reach 14th level, you can use an action to cause
life-preserving magic to emit from you. When you do
so, you and friendly creatures within 20 feet of you have
resistance to necrotic damage for 1 minute. In addition,
each creature affected by your use of Protect Life has
advantage on saving throws against spells and effects that
reduce its hit point maximum, such as a specter’s Life
Drain or the harm spell.
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you
finish a short or long rest.
BACKGROUNDSMany people come of age after being exposed to some
form of arcane magic, or after being attracted to the study
of supernatural forces. The arcane backgrounds presented
below are examples of how to expand the concept, all
designed to give players a wider range of choices when
fleshing out their characters if the GM allows this material
into the campaign. Optionally, the GM can use these
backgrounds to add depth and complexity to NPCs that
the player characters will come up against.
Some of your earliest memories are of the library you
called home while you learned to read and write under
the tutelage of your mentor. The stacks comforted you,
protected you, and took you to lands undreamed of. Now
the time has come to turn that knowledge into practical
experience, and to record your own journey for posterity.
Skill Proficiencies: Arcana, Investigation
Tool Proficiencies: Artisan’s tools (calligrapher’s supplies)
Languages: Two of your choice
Equipment: A leather-bound journal full of notes from
past research projects, a set of robes, calligrapher’s
supplies, 5 sheets of loose paper, a pair of spectacles, and a
pouch containing 15 gp
FEATURE:
Your familiarity with libraries and the tomes contained
in them is unmatched. If you spend 1 hour studying the
available books, grimoires, and codices in an archive,
library, or similar collection while researching a specific
subject, you can treat any Intelligence-based check result
related to that subject of 9 or lower as a 10. Once you use
this feature, you can’t use it again to research the same
subject in the same library.
Arcane archivists are most at home in their libraries.
Their personalities and motivations reflect their focus,
sometimes obsessive, on recorded knowledge and the
search for it. Their motives for pursuing a life as an
archivist are rarely so straightforward.
D
1 There is nothing more important than knowledge. It
is neither good nor bad. To suggest otherwise is to be
closed in mind and thought.
2 I would rather spend time with my nose in a book. I
find interacting with people discomfiting.
3 I am fascinated by a specific area of esoteric
knowledge. If I find someone who shares
that interest, we might become fast friends.
4 My mind is my sanctum. I neglect the needs
of my body as secondary, often forgoing
meals and bathing, when I’m lost in
contemplation and study.
5 I am an observer and chronicler of the
journeys, experiences, trials, and tribulations
of my companions as viewed from the
outside looking in.
6 The path to knowledge is not solely traversed
through books and study. To fully learn, you
must experience!
7 I find the blind faith of religions, cults, and
their ilk perturbing, and I ask endless questions
of those who profess such beliefs.
8 Because I believe that a sound body is essential
for a clear intellect, I relish physical activity
and exercise.
D
1 Purity. The truth of a matter is subject to the whims
of the historian. Facts are pure and incontrovertible.
(Any)
2 Focus. Precision and concentration: These are the
keys to successful completion of my objectives.
(Lawful)
3 Objectivity. Action and inaction have consequences
far beyond the immediate future. The appearance
of one morality does not preclude the emergence of
another as time goes on. (Neutral)
4 Objectification. I use resources—including
companions, allies, and bystanders—as I need them
to further my ends. (Evil)
5 Preservation. Life is knowledge, and knowledge is
life. Preserving life in all its forms is paramount to a
civilized culture. (Good)
6 Observation. I will participate only as a last resort.
Events, to be true and accurate, must unfold without
interference. (Neutral)
Years, possibly centuries, ago you were captured by the
fey. Each host, as the fey called themselves, treated their
“guest” differently. The relationship you forged with your
captors defines you just as strongly as the circumstances
of your abduction and of your escape or release. You have
been indelibly marked—emotionally, psychically, and
physically—by the fey and their special brand of hospitality.
Skill Proficiencies: Deception, Insight
Tool Proficiencies: One type of gaming set, one type of
musical instrument
Languages: Elvish, Sylvan
Equipment: A flower with petals that will never wilt,
a musical instrument (one of your choice), a set of fine
clothes, and a pouch containing 10 gp
LIFE-CHANGING EVENT
The fey have a multitude of reasons for abducting—or
rescuing—folk like you, and it’s also possible that you
or others did something to bring about your situation.
Choose or randomly determine the reason behind your
sojourn in the realm of the fey.
D
1 I always keep a journal. It grounds me to my past and
organizes my thoughts. Without it, I would be lost.
2 I carefully consider my options before making any
decision of importance.
3 I am a student—in thoughts, actions, and words—
ahead of all other roles and responsibilities.
4 A quill, given to me be my mentor during our first
lessons, is precious to me above all other things.
5 I am bound to fulfill a sacred duty to a university or a
tutor that started me on my path.
6 I stole a priceless grimoire from my patron, and they
have learned of my theft.
D
1 I am protective of all that I have learned. I have
sacrificed much for it, and it is mine to do with as I
please.
2 I have found the one true way, the path to
enlightenment. I share my teachings with all who can
hear me, whether they want to follow the path or not.
3 I place my safety ahead of the welfare of all others.
How else will my knowledge be recorded and shared
with future generations?
4 I was once confined in a prison of my own making.
Never again will I limit myself to learning without
experiencing.
5 I will not destroy a book, tome, grimoire, or text of
any kind. To lose knowledge is an abomination.
6 I share the knowledge I have worked so hard to attain
with all who seek it. A question asked is a question
that deserves to be answered.
D
1 My childhood was tithed to the fey by my family in
return for prosperity for as long I remained in their
care.
2 I made a bargain with a fox to play with its cubs in
their den. The fox turned out to be an emissary of the
Summer Court, and I was not released until the cubs
came of age.
3 Centuries ago my ancestors were rulers and made a
political alliance with the fey in exchange for tribute
to be paid every third generation. We are no longer
rulers, but the fey still demand their tithe.
4 I have no memories of my past before I was taken by
the fey.
5 I wandered into an ancient, primeval wood shortly
after learning to walk and was found by the fey, who
took me in.
6 A fey child befriended me and invited me to their
home.
7 I am the only survivor of a fey raid. They killed my
parents, but spared me for their own unknowable
reasons.
8 My parents could not care for me, and their choices
were to abandon me in a forest or a city. They chose
the forest.
D
1 I left a friend behind when I escaped, and I am
gathering resources to return and free them.
2 I did not escape from my fey captors. They allowed me
my freedom in exchange for my continued clandestine
service.
3 I earned my freedom by tricking another to take my
place with the fey. My betrayal of that person’s trust
haunts me.
4 I am free because of the actions of an unknown
benefactor. I wait for them to reveal why I was
released.
5 I feel a constant, ever-tugging connection to the lands
of the fey.
6 I was given my freedom after years of diligent,
demeaning, and debauched servitude.
D
1 I cannot lie outright, only by omission, because of my
years with the fey.
2 I will never willingly make another promise to anyone
or anything.
3 The fey creature that abducted me haunts me in my
dreams.
4 I will never accept free food, drink, or gifts from
strangers.
5 I speak in sing-song voice and in rhymes.
I never answer questions directly.
6 I am certain that my freedom from the fey is only
temporary and that any fey I meet want to recapture
me.
D
1 Art. Works of art are meant to question, challenge,
and disturb. (Any)
2 Pleasure. There are no long-term rewards, only the
enjoyments of the moment. (Chaotic)
3 Independence. Independence is the privilege of the
few who are strong to assert it. (Any)
4 Fellowship. Lasting fellowship is born in shared
suffering and teamwork when overcoming adversity.
(Any)
5 Self-confidence. There are no views, perspectives, or
standards of any worth aside from my own. (Evil)
6 Malice. I feel nothing but spite, rancor, and envy for
those that took me, and for those that let me be taken.
(Evil)
D
1 I remain a child in thought, action, and deed.
2 I defer decisions to elves and fey that I encounter,
always looking to them for guidance.
3 I long for the accommodations and sustenance I
became accustomed to as a hostage of the Fair Folk.
4 I distrust any who display traits of fey heritage.
5 I tell others what I think they want to hear, whether I
believe it not, to keep them happy.
6 I see danger in every shadow, enemies behind each
door, and threats in the eyes of strangers.
7 I never speak unless spoken to, and never look people
in the eyes.
8 I am fascinated, frightened, and uncomfortable in an
urban environment.
FEATURE: FIRST IMPRESSIONS
You were raised in a situation in which failing to
adhere to the nuances, niceties, and intrigues of the fey
court could have catastrophic repercussions. The first
impressions one makes set the tone for future endeavors.
You have learned that lesson well, and continue to apply
it. In your initial social interaction with an individual
fey, you gain a +2 bonus to the first Charisma-based
check you make.
A fey hostage will never forget the events that led to
their capture, the treatment they experienced,
or the circumstances of their release. Their
experiences with the unpredictable fey might
range from whimsical to pathological.
A quirk of fate, or a circumstance of birth, exposed you to
the intoxicating power of arcane magic and changed you
irrevocably. You spent your formative years learning about
yourself, gauging your inner reserves and how much you
are willing to sacrifice to achieve your goals.
Skill Proficiencies: Arcana and either Persuasion
or Intimidation
Tool Proficiencies: Artisan’s tools
(alchemist’s supplies), poisoner’s kit
Languages: Infernal or Abyssal
Equipment: A set of alchemist’s supplies, a
pocket knife, a piece of chalk connected to a string,
a chapbook of esoteric symbols, a set of common clothes,
and a pouch containing 10 gp
FEATURE: CHANNEL ESSENCE
You can call upon your inner reserves to recover from
debilitating, long-term injuries. As part of a short rest,
you can offset a reduction to one of your ability scores
by expending a number of Hit Dice equal to twice the
amount of the reduction that you want to negate. When
used in this manner, the Hit Dice do not confer other
benefits, such as additional hit points.
Soul channelers are drawn to the dark arts and the
manipulation of available resources to achieve their goals.
For some this might include using their own capabilities,
but an easier (and more common) method employs
summoned creatures, undead servants, and duped
allies. Not every soul channeler chooses to exploit such
opportunities, but the temptation is there for all.
D
1 I realize that gaining power comes at a cost, and I am
prepared to pay that cost, whatever it is.
2 My companions are useful for the abilities they
contribute and the protection they provide me.
3 I am comfortable in places where the dead are
gathered. I find solace and strength in the crypts,
graveyards, and necropolises of the land.
4 I loathe any who profess faith, duty, and devotion
to an entity or a cause without ensuring they will be
compensated for their service.
5 I care nothing for the suffering, pain, and plight of
others. Their concerns are not mine.
6 I will sacrifice my possessions, my needs, and my
well-being for my trusted companions.
7 I detest myself for the depths of depravity I have
plumbed to gain the power I now wield.
8 I mistrust any who have power over me or others.
D
1 My spellcasting focus is a trinket I created. I cannot
live without it.
2 My self-sufficiency provides me with comfort and
confidence.
3 I am searching for an ancient text of esoteric, arcane
knowledge. I try to make decisions and take actions
that lead me to this goal.
4 I take advantage of any opportunities that crop up,
regardless of the possible consequences.
5 I seek to harness living energies from plants, animals,
and the magical world. I wish to see beyond flesh to
the soul itself. All life is in my charge.
6 My loyalty is hard-won, but once earned it is
unwavering.
D
1 I consider my companions and all those I meet as
resources to be used and advantages to be gained.
2 I have no regard for my physical form. It is a tool and a
source of energy, nothing more.
3 I prefer the company of gregarious, ebullient, and
vociferous folk. They lift my somber spirits.
4 The easiest way is always the best way.
5 I allow myself to be driven by impulses. My first
inclination is the course of action I pursue.
6 I distrust all who rely on fickle deities and unknowable
patrons to acquire their spells, influence, and power.
D
1 Will. Embarking on the pursuit of greatness is not
enough. I must have the will to do what others shy
away from in order to accomplish my goals. (Any)
2 Sacrifice. I believe that sacrifice—personal,
emotional, or otherwise—is necessary to achieve
greatness. (Any)
3 Abstinence. I cleanse myself of distractions to
achieve purity of purpose. (Lawful)
4 Deception. I never tell the whole truth, even if there
is no apparent need to lie. The truth has been used
against me too many times. (Evil)
5 Lunacy. I embrace the turmoil in my mind and soul
that comes with manipulating eldritch energies.
(Chaotic)
6 Diabolic. I inflict pain, suffering, and strife with zeal
and gusto. (Evil)
Your connection to magic began with a term of service,
or servitude, to a magician of power. Your partnership
continued as expected for years, until the bond was
abruptly broken. In the aftermath, you found yourself with
a new body. Despite your new appearance, your actions
often betray your origin. The struggle between what you
have become and what you once were rages within you.
Skill Proficiencies: Perception, Survival
Tool Proficiencies: Artisan’s tools (alchemist’s kit)
Languages: One of your choice
Equipment: A trinket worn or carried by your previous
form, a set of traveler’s clothes, an alchemist’s kit, an
explorer’s pack, and a pouch containing 5 gp
LIFE-CHANGING EVENT
You were previously a different kind of creature. How you
became what you are, and what you know of your former
existence, can vary greatly depending on the circumstances.
Choose or randomly determine the life-changing event that
brought about your transformation.
D
1 My bond was severed and my form irrevocably changed
in a surge of wild, uncontrolled magic that claimed the
life of the mage who called me their familiar.
2 The Pact of the Chain between my warlock and myself
was dissolved unexpectedly with their passing. Their
patron, not wanting to lose two advocates, granted me
my current form as a reward for services rendered, and
expects me to continue their works.
3 My service to, and partnership with, a mage of
great power and cunning was rewarded with
transmogrification into my new body.
4 I awoke in an unfamiliar body, with only dream-like
memories of my prior service to a being of great
arcane ability.
5 I broke my bond with my master, replacing it with a
pledge of service to a higher power. Part of the bargain
was providing me with a new form to more easily hide
from my past.
6 I stood by my master’s side as aide, ally, and advisor
until an unknown enemy severed our connection,
robbed me of my true body, and captured my master.
7 My master, infirm with age and senility,
unintentionally released me and altered my body in an
attempt to rejuvenate themselves.
8 I betrayed my master in a time of crisis, and their last
act was to transform me into my current form, robbing
me of my natural body forever.
FEATURE: FAMILIAR INSIGHT
You are a transformed familiar, and although your physical
form has changed, you will never forsake the instincts
and insights you were born with. When interacting with
creatures of your original type, you have a +2 bonus on
Wisdom (Insight) checks to detect their motives and the
veracity of their claims.
Transformed familiars often display personality traits and
quirks that are holdovers from their prior lives. They might
hold to these affectations consciously, or without realizing
their behavior is unusual. Either way, every transformed
familiar carries their past with them in some manner.
D
1 I am still friendly and even loyal to arcane casters,
especially wizards.
2 I swear no oaths and make no promises to anyone
else. I stand alone.
3 I loathe slavery and enchantments, and work to free
those trapped by chains or magic.
4 I have not forgot my former master, and I continue to
honor my pledge to them.
5 I prefer to serve, aid, and protect my allies and friends.
6 I dislike disguises or changing my form further; I
want the world to see me as I now am.
D
1 I prefer to sleep in the same fashion that I rested when
I was a familiar.
2 Transmutation magic of all kinds frightens me to the
core. I will not willingly use it or have it used on me.
3 In my heart of hearts, I long for the life I left behind.
4 I sometimes speak in the language of my old form, or
forget the speech of humanoids.
5 I still prefer the foods of my prior form, and
sometimes refuse the foods commonly consumed by
my new one.
6 Life was easier as a familiar, and I am wistful about
those bygone times.
D
1 Loyalty. Remaining steadfast when there are no
witnesses to see it or accolades to celebrate it is the
measure of a person. (Any)
2 Service. The path to enlightenment lies in serving a
greater cause. (Any)
3 Freedom. Better to die free than to live in chains.
(Chaotic)
4 Duty. A pact, entered into freely, can never be taken
back and must be fulfilled. (Lawful).
5 Atonement. It is my lot in my new life to make up for
the failings in my first one. (Good)
6 Family. My family is my port in the storm and my
refuge from the world. (Any)
D
1 I am fiercely independent, and do not form strong
emotional connections to others.
2 I seek the advice and guidance of others before
acting.
3 I continue to behave as if I’m in my original body.
4 I am lost in social situations, and the behaviors
expected of me confound me.
5 I punctuate my exclamations with a subtle growl of
emphasis.
6 I keep my own counsel, sharing my thoughts
reluctantly, if at all.
7 I am fascinated by seeing familiar places through the
eyes of my new body.
8 I react instinctually to stress, problems, and
challenges. My gut reaction is the right one.
combine their understanding of alchemical reagents and
elixirs with their knowledge of spellcraft to create new and
formidable magical effects.
Even more than this, though, alkemancy embodies a
unique philosophy of life and nature. Alkemancers don’t
concoct useful potions and philters as an end in itself.
Ultimately, they seek to expand their minds past mortal
limits, or even to achieve true immortality, and alkemancy
is simply the path they follow in pursuit of that goal.
Transmuters and alkemancers belong to similar schools
of thought. But where transmuters have little use for
alchemy and its secrets, preferring to rely on brute magical
force to achieve their aims—at least, that’s the opinion held
by traditional alchemists—alkemancers combine extensive
knowledge of alchemy with the many ways that the six
fundamental essences can be applied to arcane magic.
Too many arcane spellcasters and scholars view alchemy
as magic’s poor second cousin—an academic pursuit with
practical applications, but still nothing that wizards with
real talent would devote serious time or effort to. While
alchemy can achieve astounding, even nearly miraculous
feats, it’s always been overshadowed by the power and
versatility of arcane magic. Because alchemy requires
extensive preparation and forethought, adventurers tend
to prefer the flexibility and immediacy of spellcasting.
In some areas, a branch of alchemy is practiced that
surpasses the simple alchemy familiar to the rest of the
world. Known as magical chemistry, or simply alkemancy,
this discipline delves into the properties of common
alchemical substances, such as brimstone and salt, and
the means by which they can be used to achieve physical
and metaphysical transformation in objects and creatures
on levels unseen in most lands. Alkemancy practitioners
Alkemancy Magic
Magic in
All ThingsThe power of alkemancy resides within the six
fundamental essences: brimstone, lead, quicksilver,
quintessence, salt, and void salt. These essences parallel the
four standard elements, as well as the two more esoteric
elements of metal and void, but are unique to alchemy.
Brimstone. The yellow of brimstone (otherwise known
as sulfur) represents activity, energy, and masculinity,
and it’s related to the sun, volcanoes, and elemental
fire. Brimstone is a destructive essence present in small
amounts in explosives, various acids, and in substances
such as alchemist’s fire.
Lead. Also erroneously referred to as antimony (a
different metal that lead is sometimes combined with),
lead represents coldness and heaviness, transformation,
and the removal of impurities in objects and creatures. It
is associated with broader elemental metals and is often
called the oldest or first metal. Lead is reactive and can be
toxic in various forms over long periods of exposure—
useful qualities in lingering poisons and slow-acting
corrosives. It’s used as a component in many alchemical
creations and supplies.
Quicksilver. Also known as mercury, this silvery metal
represents passivity, femininity, and malleability. It’s
associated with elemental water and the moon. Quicksilver
is seen as a creative essence despite its passive nature.
It’s also a lethal poison, much faster-acting than lead, for
example. A fluid dram of refined quicksilver is occasionally
used in vials of both alchemical poisons and antitoxins.
Quintessence. One of the rarest and most mysterious of
the six fundamental essences, quintessence represents
thought, life, and spirit. It is distantly related to elemental
air; in its commonest form, it appears as a vaporous,
silvery liquid. Quintessence is never used in common
alchemical items, largely because it’s one of the most
difficult of the essences to obtain and it dissipates as soon
as it’s exposed to air. Alkemancers are always keen to find
viable substitutes for quintessence in their concoctions.
Salt. The most common of the six fundamental essences
is salt, which represents matter, physicality, and the human
body. It is closely related to elemental earth. Purified salt
is used in many common alchemical items, and solutions
of salt are used widely in mundane and supernatural
formulas and rituals.
Void Salt. Dull black crystals distilled from the blood of
slain creatures of the Void, the substance known as Void
salt takes its name from its granular appearance. Void salt
is associated with dissolution, entropy, and madness. It
is a dangerous substance to work with, because merely
touching it with bare skin deals 1 necrotic damage. Anyone
intending to work with Void salt should wear gloves of
metal or thick leather, and even those substances corrode
soon after coming in contact with Void salt unless they’re
protected with an anti-necrotic energy coating. The use
of Void salt is reserved for rare alchemical concoctions,
mainly acids, poisons, and explosives.
Most alkemancy spells reside on the wizard spell list. The
sorcerer and the warlock also have access to a smattering
of alkemancy magic.

DescriptionsThe following spells are presented in alphabetical order.
=== SPELL END ===

=== SPELL START ===
Name: ACID GATE
Level: 7
School: Conjuration
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S, M (a vial of acid and a polished silver
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Description:
mirror worth 125 gp)
You create a portal of swirling, acidic green vapor in an
unoccupied space you can see. This portal connects with a
target destination within 100 miles that you are personally
familiar with and have seen with your own eyes, such as
your wizard’s tower or an inn you have stayed at. You and
up to three creatures of your choice can enter the portal
and pass through it, arriving at the target destination
(or within 10 feet of it, if it is currently occupied). If the
target destination doesn’t exist or is inaccessible, the spell
automatically fails and the gate doesn’t form.
Any creature that tries to move through the gate, other
than those selected by you when the spell was cast, takes
10d6 acid damage and is teleported 1d100 × 10 feet in
a random, horizontal direction. If the creature makes a
successful Intelligence saving throw, it can’t be teleported
by this portal, but it still takes acid damage when it enters
the acid-filled portal and every time it ends its turn in
contact with it.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell
slot of 8th level or higher, you can allow one additional
creature to use the gate for each slot level above 7th.
=== SPELL END ===

=== SPELL START ===
Name: ACID RAIN
Level: 5
School: Conjuration
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 150 feet
Components: V, S, M (a drop of acid)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Description:
You unleash a storm of swirling acid in a cylinder 20 feet
wide and 30 feet high, centered on a point you can see. The
area is heavily obscured by the driving acidfall. A creature
that starts its turn in the area or that enters the area for
the first time on its turn takes 6d6 acid damage, or half
as much damage if it makes a successful Dexterity saving
throw. A creature takes half as much damage from the acid
(as if it had made a successful saving throw) at the start of
its first turn after leaving the affected area.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage increases by
1d6 for each slot level above 5th.
=== SPELL END ===

=== SPELL START ===
Name: ALCHEMICAL FORM
Level: 6
School: Transmutation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self
Components: V, S, M (a vial of acid, poison, or
Duration: 1 minute
Description:
alchemist's fire)
You transform into an amoebic form composed of highly
acidic and poisonous alchemical jelly. While in this form:
• you are immune to acid and poison damage and to the
poisoned and stunned conditions;
• you have resistance to nonmagical fire, piercing, and
slashing damage;
• you can’t speak, cast spells, use items or weapons, or
manipulate objects;
• your gear melds into your body and reappears when the
spell ends;
• you don't need to breathe;
• your speed is 20 feet;
• your size doesn’t change, but you can move through
and between obstructions as if you were two size
categories smaller; and
• you gain the following action: Melee Weapon Attack:
spellcasting ability modifier + proficiency
bonus to hit, range 5 ft., one target;
Hit: 4d6 acid or poison damage (your
choice), and the target must make
a successful Constitution saving
throw or be poisoned until the start
of your next turn.
=== SPELL END ===

=== SPELL START ===
Name: BLOOD TO ACID
Level: 9
School: Transmutation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous
Description:
When you cast this spell, you designate a creature within
range and convert its blood into virulent acid. The target
must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save,
it takes 10d12 acid damage and is stunned by the pain for
1d4 rounds. On a successful save, it takes half the damage
and isn’t stunned.
Creatures without blood, such as constructs and plants,
are not affected by this spell. If blood to acid is cast on
a creature composed mainly of blood, such as a blood
elemental or a blood zombie (Creature Codex, p. 393), the
creature is slain by the spell if its saving throw fails.

Name: BOILING OIL
Level: 2
School: Conjuration
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S, M (a vial of oil)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Description:
You conjure a shallow, 15-foot-radius pool of boiling oil
centered on a point within range. The pool is difficult
terrain, and any creature that enters the pool or starts its
turn there must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed
save, the creature takes 3d8 fire damage and falls prone.
On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage
and doesn’t fall prone.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by
1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.

Name: BOTTLED ARCANA
Level: 5
School: Transmutation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M (an empty glass container)
Duration: See below
Description:
By touching an empty, stoppered glass container such as a
vial or flask, you magically enable it to hold a single spell.
To be captured, the spell must be cast within 1 round of
casting bottled arcana and it must be intentionally cast into
the container. The container can hold one spell of 3rd level
or lower. The spell can be held in the container for as much
as 24 hours, after which the container reverts to a mundane
vessel and any magic inside it dissipates harmlessly.
As an action, any creature can unstop the container,
thereby releasing the spell. If the spell has a range of self,
the creature opening the container is affected; otherwise,
the creature opening the container designates the target
according to the captured spell’s description. If a creature
opens the container unwittingly (not knowing that the
container holds a spell), the spell targets the creature
opening the container or is centered on its space instead
(whichever is more appropriate). Dispel magic cast on the
container targets bottled arcana, not the spell inside. If
bottled arcana is dispelled, the container becomes mundane
and the spell inside dissipates harmlessly.
Until the spell in the container is released, its caster can’t
regain the spell slot used to cast that spell. Once the spell is
released, its caster regains the use of that slot normally.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
spell slot of 6th level or higher, the level of the spell the
container can hold increases by one for every slot level
above 5th.

Name: BOTTOMLESS STOMACH
Level: 1
School: Transmutation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self
Components: V
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour
Description:
When you cast this spell, you gain the ability to
consume dangerous substances and contain them in an
extradimensional reservoir in your stomach. The spell
allows you to swallow most liquids, such as acids, alcohol,
poison, and even quicksilver, and hold them safely in your
stomach. You are unaffected by swallowing the substance,
but the spell doesn’t give you resistance or immunity to the
substance in general; for example, you could safely drink
a bucket of a black dragon’s acidic spittle, but you’d still be
burned if you were caught in the dragon’s breath attack or
if that bucket of acid were dumped over your head.
The spell allows you to store up to 10 gallons of liquid at
one time. The liquid doesn’t need to all be of the same type,
and different types don’t mix while in your stomach. Any
liquid in excess of 10 gallons has its normal effect when
you try to swallow it.
At any time before you stop concentrating on the spell,
you can regurgitate up to 1 gallon of liquid stored in your
stomach as a bonus action. The liquid is vomited into
an adjacent 5-foot square. A target in that square must
succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be affected
by the liquid. The GM determines the exact effect based
on the type of liquid regurgitated, using 1d6 damage of the
appropriate type as the baseline.
When you stop concentrating on the spell, its duration
expires, or it’s dispelled, the extradimensional reservoir
and the liquid it contains cease to exist.

Description:
A swirling jet of acid sprays from you in a direction you
choose. The acid fills a line 60 feet long and 5 feet wide.
Each creature in the line takes 14d6 acid damage, or half
as much damage if it makes a successful Dexterity saving
throw. A creature reduced to 0 hit points by this spell is
killed, and its body is liquefied. In addition, each creature
other than you that’s in the line or within 5 feet of it is
poisoned for 1 minute by toxic fumes. Creatures that
don’t breathe or that are immune to acid damage aren’t
poisoned. A poisoned creature can repeat the Constitution
saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the

Upon casting this spell, you delay the next potion you
consume from taking effect for up to 1 hour. You must
consume the potion within 1 round of casting delay potion;
otherwise the spell has no effect. At any point during delay
potion’s duration, you can use a bonus action to cause the
potion to go into effect. When the potion is activated,
it works as if you had just drunk it. While the potion is
delayed, it has no effect at all and you can consume and
benefit from other potions normally.
You can delay only one potion at a time. If you try to
delay the effect of a second potion, the spell fails, the first
potion has no effect, and the second potion has its normal

Duration: 1 minute or 1 hour
Description:
You make a ranged spell attack to hurl a large globule of
sticky, magical glue at a creature within 120 feet. If the
attack hits, the target creature is restrained. A restrained
creature can break free by using an action to make a
successful Strength saving throw. When the creature
breaks free, it takes 2d6 slashing damage from the glue
tearing its skin. If your ranged spell attack roll was a critical
hit or exceeded the target’s AC by 5 or more, the Strength
saving throw is made with disadvantage. The target can also
be freed by an application of universal solvent or by taking
20 acid damage. The glue dissolves when the creature
breaks free or at the end of 1 minute.
Alternatively, gluey globule can also be used to glue an
object to a solid surface or to another object. In this case,
the spell works like a single application of sovereign glue and
lasts for 1 hour.

individual creature can draw is determined by dividing 120
by the number of creatures with access to the pool. Hit
points are drawn as a bonus action by the creature gaining
the temporary hit points. Any number can be drawn at

gas, or triggers an explosion of alchemist’s fire. A hit
destroys the alchemical reagents, rendering them
harmless. The attack is made against the most suitable
object Armor Class.
This spell can also be used against a creature within range
that is wholly or partially composed of acidic, poisonous,
or alchemical components, such as an alchemical golem
or an ochre jelly. In that case, a hit deals 6d6 force damage,
and the target must make a successful Constitution saving

You create a long, thin blade of razor-sharp salt crystals.
You can wield it as a longsword, using your spellcasting
ability to modify your weapon attack rolls. The sword
deals 2d8 slashing damage on a hit, and any creature
struck by the blade must make a successful Constitution
saving throw or be stunned by searing pain until the start
of your next turn. Constructs and undead are immune to
the blade’s secondary (stun) effect; plants and creatures
composed mostly of water, such as water elementals, also
take an additional 2d8 necrotic damage if they fail the
saving throw.
The spell lasts until you stop concentrating on it, the
duration expires, or you let go of the blade for any reason.
Wizards who combine traditional spellcasting with
advanced alchemical practices and concoctions are called
alkemancers. They are a mysterious breed sometimes
confused with transmuters, with whom they share a
complicated rivalry.
Unlike many transmuters, who focus on the physical
transformation of objects and creatures, alkemancers
are concerned with the search for human perfection and
immortality, and they use alchemy as a means in this
pursuit. Still, there is much crossover between the two
specialties. Alkemancers and transmuters can be found
working toward the same goals, as both allies and rivals.
Alkemancy spells typically blend conjuration,
necromancy, and transmutation effects. Few alkemancy
spells belong to the schools of evocation or illusion, since
spells of these schools summon energy out of nothingness
or create things that are not real; both concepts are at odds
with the precepts of alkemancy, which seeks to reduce
energy and matter to its constituent parts and refine them
to a more purified (or useful) state of existence.
Except as noted below, alkemancers function as wizards
and use the wizard spell list.
Beginning when you select this specialty at 2nd level, the
gold and time you must spend to copy an alkemancy spell
into your spellbook are halved.
When you gain a level, one of the two spells you learn
for gaining a level can be an alkemancy spell even if you’ve
never encountered the spell before. Similarly, when you
learn a new cantrip, it can be an alkemancy cantrip even if
you’ve never previously encountered it.
Beginning at 2nd level, you gain proficiency with
alchemical supplies if you did not already have it and your
proficiency bonus with alchemical supplies is doubled. You
also halve the cost of alchemical items you create, enabling
you to fashion most basic items in a single day. Finally, you
gain proficiency with alchemical weapons, and you add
your proficiency bonus to their damage rolls when you use
them as weapons.
Beginning at 6th level, you can add one of the six
fundamental essences to your spells as an additional
material component at the cost of 1 gp per spell level. This
addition doesn't increase the casting time of the spell or
any of its other effects, except as follows.
• Adding brimstone to a spell that deals fire damage gives
the flames a bluish hue and releases irritating vapors. A
creature damaged by the spell must make a successful
Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for a
number of rounds equal to your Intelligence modifier
(minimum of 1).
• Adding lead to a spell that improves your Armor Class,
such as mage armor or shield, increases the spell’s AC
bonus by 2. If the spell has a duration longer than 1
round, the duration increases by a number of rounds
equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1).
Any visible spell effect modified with the addition of
lead takes on a dull gray sheen.
• Adding quicksilver to a spell that changes the form of
a creature or an object, such as alter self or polymorph,
increases the spell’s duration by a number of minutes
equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1
minute). For any such spell that has a duration of less
than 10 minutes, such as alchemical form, the increase
is measured in rounds instead of minutes. Any change
in form modified with quicksilver is accompanied by
lustrous wisps or motes of silvery energy.
• Adding quintessence to a necromancy spell that grants
temporary hit points, such as false life or life hack,
increases the temporary hit points gained by a number
equal to twice your Intelligence modifier (minimum of
2). Adding quintessence to a spell doesn’t change the
spell’s visible aspects.
• Adding salt to a spell that deals acid damage gives the
acid a pale, crystalline hue and causes it to become
extremely painful. Any creature damaged by the spell
must also make a successful Constitution saving throw
or lose 1d4 points from its Strength and Dexterity
scores (rolled separately). These lost ability score points
return automatically after a number of rounds equal to
your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1).
• Adding void salt to a spell that deals necrotic damage
causes the spell to shed palpable strands of darkness.
Any creature damaged by the spell is also surrounded
by a veil of cloying shadows and must make a successful
Constitution saving throw or be restrained for a
number of rounds equal to your Intelligence modifier
(minimum of 1).
Beginning at 10th level, you automatically learn the
formulas for a number of elixirs, oils, philters, or potions
of your choice equal to 1 + your Intelligence modifier
(minimum of one). You do not need to spend time or gold
researching these formulas.
When you brew an elixir, oil, philter, or potion based
on one of the formulas you obtained, you can add exotic
alchemical reagents to the mixture at the cost of additional
gold equal to half the potion's standard cost. If you do so,
the resulting mixture is more powerful than normal: if the
potion’s effect is instantaneous (such as a potion of healing),
it automatically has its maximum effect; if the potion has a
duration (such as a potion of giant strength), it lasts for twice
its normal duration.
Beginning at 14th level, you learn the secret formulas
for brewing the fabled Six Elixirs, magical draughts of
incredible potency and rarity. Each elixir takes a full year
or more to create from exceedingly rare ingredients, but
once finished and consumed or otherwise applied, it
grants its user a permanent bonus of some sort. The six
elixirs are described in the next section.
Additionally, once you reach 14th level, you become so
adept at working with dangerous chemicals and reagents
that you gain resistance to acid damage and poison
damage and immunity to the poisoned condition.
Alkemancers are responsible for the creation of many
astonishing alchemical items, but the pinnacle of their
craftsmanship is known collectively as the Six Elixirs,
magical liquids of such incredible power and rarity that
they feature in many tales and legends. Vast resources
and even many lives have been expended in the pursuit of
these fabled elixirs. A single elixir could be the focus of an
entire campaign arc for an alkemancer character or group
of adventurers.
Brewing any one of the Six Elixirs takes one year of
work with rare, mysterious, and sometimes dangerous
ingredients. The ingredients needed to create each
elixir are given in its description. The GM can modify
ingredients to meet the needs of the campaign.
Potion, legendary
This greasy black liquid acts as a poison when drunk or
rubbed on flesh. Its unfortunate or foolish user takes 12d6
poison damage, or half as much damage with a successful
DC 20 Constitution saving throw.
Its true power is revealed, however, when black elixir is
smeared on a doorway or other portal; the magical oil acts
as a forbiddance spell with a duration of one year. Unlike
the spell, black elixir doesn’t incorporate a password and
only affects celestials and fiends. Typically, the creator of
the elixir determines when the elixir is created whether the
forbiddance effect deals radiant or necrotic damage.
Ingredients. The heart of a marut, the powdered horn of
a ki-rin, and a vial of black mud taken from the bottom of a
lake that at least one celestial or fiend has bathed in.
Potion, legendary
The most famous of the six elixirs is this thick, golden,
syrupy liquid that grants its imbiber eternal life. The
potion completely stops the aging process and renders the
imbiber immune to all natural and magical diseases and
poisons. The drinker can still be harmed or killed through
other methods such as violence, but the march of time no
longer holds any threat over him or her.
Ingredients. A thimble of distilled sunlight, the breath of
a solar, and the hair of a venerable sage who is at least 100
years old.
Potion, legendary
This dark, grainy liquid tastes positively awful. Anyone
imbibing the elixir gains permanent resistance to
bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage and gains a
damage threshold of 5, but their speed is reduced by 10
feet and they always make Dexterity saving throws and
Dexterity ability checks with disadvantage that can’t be
overcome or canceled out by any means.
Ingredients. The core of an iron golem, a shard of purest
adamantine, and the powdered teeth of a mountain giant.
Potion, legendary
This bright green, effervescent elixir grants its consumer
incredible Charisma when dealing with celestials,
elementals, fey, and fiends. The drinker always has
advantage on Charisma checks when dealing with
extraplanar creatures, and when one of the selected
creatures is called or conjured, it arrives with maximum
hit points.
Ingredients. The tears of an invisible stalker, the claw of a
pit fiend, and the tongue of a bard of at least 10th level.
Potion, legendary
This silvery-white elixir has a variety of effects depending
on whether it is drunk, rubbed on a creature's feet, or
smeared on the hull of a boat. If drunk, the elixir confers
the ability to breathe both air and water with equal ease. If
rubbed on the feet, the elixir provides a creature with the
ability to walk on water as if wearing a ring of water walking.
If placed on the hull of a boat or similar vessel, the vessel
gains a damage threshold of 20 against all environmental
effects, and anyone piloting the vessel has advantage on
ability checks associated with it. All of these effects are
permanent.
Ingredients. The scale of a merfolk princess, a vial of pure
elemental water, and the eye of a kraken.
Potion, legendary
This vermilion-hued elixir neutralizes all magical and
nonmagical diseases and poisons, all curses of 8th level or
lower, and all exhaustion effects, as well as restoring hit
points as a superior healing potion. If this elixir is poured
over a corpse that has been dead for no more than a year, it
restores the creature to life (as the resurrection spell) even if
the corpse could normally not be resurrected.
Ingredients. A mixture of purest cinnabar, the blood of
a slain dragon of at least adult age, and the hearts of six
celestial tigers willingly donated to the alkemancer.
Alkemancers have devised countless magic items over the
centuries. Their creations range from fairly standard items
such as the bubbling retort and scalehide cream to uniquely
alkemantic items such as Anuraag's crucible.
Wondrous item, very rare
This large alembic is a glass retort supported by a bronze
tripod and connected to a smaller glass container by a
bronze spout. The bronze fittings are etched with arcane
symbols, and the glass parts of the alembic sometimes
emit bright, amethyst sparks.
If a magic item is placed inside the alembic and a fire lit
beneath it, the magic item dissolves and its magical energy
drains into the smaller container. Artifacts, legendary
magic items, and any magic item that won’t physically fit
into the alembic (anything larger than a shortsword or a
cloak) can’t be dissolved in this way. Full dissolution and
distillation of an item’s magical energy takes 1 hour, but 10
minutes is enough time to render most items nonmagical.
If an item spends a full hour dissolving in the alembic,
its magical energy coalesces in the smaller container as
a lump of material resembling gray-purple, stiff dough
known as arcanoplasm. This material is safe to handle
and easy to incorporate into new magic items. Using
arcanoplasm while creating a magic item reduces the cost
of the new item by 10 percent per degree of rarity of the
magic item that was distilled into the arcanoplasm.
An alembic of unmaking can distill or disenchant one item
per 24 hours.
ANURAAG’S CRUCIBLE
Artifact
Thousands of years ago, a powerful alkemancer named
Anuraag constructed an enormous crucible in his quest
to create the perfect organism. He hoped it would
bring forth an immortal being that could surpass the
limitations imposed by human flesh and surpass even
the gods. Anuraag used the crucible to create so many
monstrosities that eventually the local deities had to take
action against him. The alkemancer was destroyed for
his impertinence, and his crucible was sealed away at the
bottom of a mighty chasm.
Anuraag's crucible is an enormous object fashioned from
white clay and engraved with mystical symbols chased
with burnished copper and electrum. The crucible is
large enough to hold a single Huge creature, two Large
creatures, four Medium creatures, or eight Small ones.
If one or more creatures are placed in the crucible and
the crucible is heated over an intense, magical flame, each
creature must make a DC 20 Constitution saving throw
against the crucible’s powerful transmutation magic. If
this saving throw fails, the creature’s body liquefies and
the creature is blinded, deafened, and paralyzed until the
transformation is complete. The creature’s equipment
doesn’t dissolve; as a result, most creatures are stripped
naked before being placed in the crucible. Over the course
of 10 minutes, the liquefied creature transforms into
another creature.
If this transformation is interrupted, the transforming
creature is slain. It can be brought back to life in its
original form by a resurrection spell or comparable magic.
If the process reaches completion, the creature
transforms into another creature as if affected by a
shapechange spell. The transformed creature must make
a successful DC 20 Wisdom saving throw or lose its
memory and all its previous abilities, traits, and features,
which are replaced by the blank mind of a newly born
version of the creature it transformed into. Whether or not
a creature retains its mental faculties, the newly assumed
form is permanent. At that point, the creature can regain
its former form (and memories and abilities) only through
a wish spell or comparable magic.
Constructs and undead are immune to the crucible’s
power, as is any creature that can change its shape at will,
such as a doppelganger.
To determine what a creature transforms into, roll a d20.

* You can introduce a new creature into the campaign or
choose something from Creature Codex, Tome of Beasts, or
another book of monsters.
Destroying the Crucible. Anuraag's crucible can be
destroyed if a celestial and a fiend, both of at least challenge
rating 15, willingly allow themselves to be transformed at
the same time. If this happens, the crucible can’t take the
burden of transforming both creatures and shatters in a
spectacular explosion that deals 20d6 piercing damage to
all creatures in a 60-foot radius, or half as much damage
with a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw.
Potion, very rare
This foul-smelling, murky, purple-gray liquid is created
from the liquefied brains of spellcasting creatures such as
aboleths. Anyone consuming this repulsive mixture must
make a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw. On a successful
save, the drinker is infused with magical power and regains
1d6 + 4 expended spell slots. On a failed save, the drinker
is afflicted with a form of short-term madness lasting for
1 day. If a creature consumes multiple doses of brain juice
and fails three consecutive Intelligence saving throws,
it gains a form of long-term madness permanently and
automatically fails all further saving throws brought about
by drinking brain juice.
Wondrous item, uncommon
This long, thin retort is fashioned from smoky yellow glass
and is topped with an intricately carved brass stopper.
You can unstopper the retort and fill it with liquid as an
action. Once you do so, it spews out multicolored bubbles
in a 20-foot radius. The bubbles last for 1d4 + 1 rounds.
While they last, creatures within the radius are blinded and
the area is heavily obscured to all creatures except those
with tremorsense. The liquid in the retort is destroyed in
the process with no harmful effect on its surroundings. If
any bubbles are popped, they burst with a wet smacking
sound but no other effect.
Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)
This wide leather girdle has many sewn-in pouches and
holsters that hold an assortment of empty beakers and
vials. Once you have attuned to the girdle, these containers
magically fill with the following liquids:
• 2 flasks of alchemist’s fire
• 2 flasks of alchemist’s ice
• 2 vials of acid
• 2 jars of swarm repellent
• 1 vial of assassin’s blood poison
• 1 potion of climbing
• 1 potion of healing
Each container magically replenishes each day at dawn, if
you are wearing the girdle. All the potions and alchemical
substances produced by the girdle lose their properties if
they’re transferred to another container before being used.
Wondrous item, uncommon
Sometimes known as weedkiller oil, this greasy brown fluid
contains the crushed husks of dozens of locusts. One vial
of the oily substance can coat one weapon or up to five
pieces of ammunition. Applying the oil takes 1 minute.
Once applied, the coated weapon or ammunition deals an
additional 1d6 necrotic damage to plants or plant creatures
on every successful hit for the next hour.
The oil can also be applied directly to a willing, helpless,
or immobile plant or plant creature. In this case, the
substance deals 4d6 necrotic damage, which is enough to
kill most ordinary plant life smaller than a large tree.
POTION, PILL FORM
Rarity varies by potion type
Alkemancers have mastered the craft of condensing
potions into pills. Potions in pill form have the same effect
as regular potions and have the same color as the potions
they’re derived from, but an individual pill has effectively
no weight and can be concealed very easily in a boot,
pouch, hatband, or secret pocket. A pill can be swallowed
as a bonus action. A potion in pill form costs five times as
much as the regular version of the potion.
Wondrous item, rare
As an action, you can rub this dull green cream over your
skin. When you do, you sprout thick, olive-green scales
like those of a giant lizard or green dragon that last for
1 hour. These scales give you a natural AC of 15 + your
Constitution modifier. This natural AC doesn’t combine
with any worn armor or with a Dexterity bonus to AC.
A jar of scalehide cream contains 1d6 + 1 doses.
In addition to the many spells and magic items
alkemancers have created, they are also responsible for
scores of nonmagical items that are tremendously useful. A
few of these are described here.
ALCHEMIST’S ICE
This blue-white flask is cool to the touch because it contains
a volatile liquid that turns to ice when exposed to air. If the
flask is poured over a surface, it creates a 5-foot patch of ice
that functions as regular ice for movement purposes. The
flask can be thrown at a creature like a flask of alchemist’s
fire; if it hits, it deals 1d8 cold damage and the creature
must make a successful DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or its
speed becomes 0 until the start of your next turn.
Alchemist’s ice was invented by alkemancers in the
tropics as a way of keeping their food and drinks cold, and
many restaurants and taverns still use it for this purpose. A
vial of alchemist’s ice costs 50 gp.
The head of this arrow is fitted with a syringe that can be
filled with liquid. When it strikes a creature, the arrow
deals 1d4 piercing damage plus the effect of whatever
liquid the syringe injects into the creature. Poisons are
commonly employed, as are acid, drugs, and various
eclectic potions.
A hypodermic arrow is extremely fragile; it always
breaks on impact, whether it hits the target or not. One
hypodermic arrow costs 25 gp. They’re always sold empty,
but those found in treasure hoards or among monsters’
gear might be already filled. Filling the syringe takes an
action, but it can be done hours or days before the arrow is
used.
This slimy yellow paste can be smeared over exposed parts
of the body to protect against attacks by insect swarms. A
swarm of ants, beetles, biting flies, wasps, or similar insects
that enters your space while you’re protected by swarm
repellent must make a successful DC 10 Constitution
saving throw or be unable to attack you. A repelled swarm
can repeat this saving throw at the start of its next turn;
most swarms prefer to seek out an unprotected target.
A jar of swarm repellent costs 40 gp and holds enough
paste to protect two Medium or four Small creatures.
Applying the repellent takes 1 minute, so it’s not a good
option in the middle of combat, but it’s effective for 1 hour
or until you’re immersed in water.
A tooth capsule is a false tooth, or a cap that fits over a
tooth, that contains a dose of a potion in pill form. (The pill
loaded into a tooth capsule can’t be changed.) To activate
the tooth capsule, you simply bite down on it as a bonus
action and make a DC 10 Strength check. On a successful
check, the capsule shatters and releases the pill, which you
can then swallow, hold in your mouth, or spit out.
Determining whether a tooth in someone else’s mouth
is a tooth capsule takes a successful DC 15 Intelligence
(Investigation) or Wisdom (Medicine) check. Obviously,
the creature must be restrained, unconscious, paralyzed,
or cooperative in order for the tooth to be examined.
Tooth capsules containing poison are often used by spies
and operatives of fanatical organizations who are willing
to die rather than allow their secrets to be captured by their
enemies.
Tooth capsules are usually priced at 100 gp plus the cost
of whatever potion they’re loaded with. The use of poison
or other harmful potions in a tooth capsule is illegal in
some places, and the black market price for one in such a
place might be much higher.
The heavenly planes shine with light and power, as deities
both benevolent and stern look down from their thrones.
Without question, the most powerful of those gods’ servants
are the angels. Angels carry the word of their creators to
mortal ears and bring down their righteous blades against
creatures of darkness. These entities are mighty beyond
mortal ken, and their very names seethe with the essence of
creation. The secrets of harnessing the power of the angels
are hidden within those names, and a select few mortals
have learned how to realize that potential.
The first angelic seals and wards were passed to worthy
mortals as rewards for their sacrifice and valor in the
service of light, and as weapons to be used in the struggle
against the fiendish hordes. An angelic seal is the written
form of the true name of an angel, inscribed on an object
or a surface in a particular way to draw on the essence of
that angel’s power. That power flows through the written
Angelic Magic
VARIANT RULE: VIRTUOUS CASTERS
Angelic spells are principally intended to be used by
good‑aligned spellcasters, though nothing prevents
non‑good casters from learning them. As an optional rule,
the DM can declare that a non‑good caster of angelic
spells can gradually become more inclined toward a good
alignment, provided that the caster uses such magic
frequently for non‑evil purposes.
The alignment of a spellcaster who satisfies that condition
while advancing through two levels of experience moves
from evil to neutral or from neutral to good (at the player's
option, for a player character). After gaining an additional
four levels, a caster who started out evil can move from
neutral to good.
Angelic magic has no effect on the lawful or chaotic
component of a caster's alignment.
Knowledge of angelic spells is rare, and it’s not possible
for a spellcaster to develop or learn these esoteric spells
without being trained in these specialized practices.
Occasionally, the powers of light make a gift of a particular
spell to a favored champion. Also, tomes containing the
notes and experiments of the first angelic scribes still exist
in hidden libraries and forgotten shrines.
A spellcaster fortunate enough to discover an angelic
spell in written form can gain access to it through study.
The usual method of gaining this access is through the
pursuit of the angelic scribe wizard specialty. Angelic
scribes preserve the knowledge embodied in the angels’
names and pass those secrets to their apprentices so the
forces of good will always be able to wield their mightiest
weapons in times of need.
representation and into the individual who carries it, or
into a location that bears a ward. The angel isn’t harmed or
hindered when a fraction of its power is siphoned this way,
but it does notice, and woe befalls any wicked soul who
steals the secret of a seal and misuses its power.
Seals and wards aren’t the only expressions of angelic
power available to mortals. In the ages since the first
angelic names were carved into earthly forms, the battles
between light and darkness have tested the limits of the
heavenly host. In the wake of these struggles, mortal
practitioners experimented with variations on the seals
and found ways to isolate the power of the angels and
shape it into spells.

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Description:
You conjure a minor celestial manifestation to protect a
creature you can see within range. A faintly glowing image
resembling a human head and shoulders hovers within
5 feet of the target for the duration. The manifestation
moves to interpose itself between the target and any
incoming attacks, granting the target a +2 bonus to AC.
Also, the first time the target gets a failure on a Dexterity

Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Description:
You call down a blessing in the name of an angel of
protection. A creature you can see within range shimmers

The spell then ends.
=== SPELL END ===

=== SPELL START ===
Name: BLADE OF WRATH
Level: 3
School: Evocation
Casting Time: 1 bonus action
Range: Self
Components: V, S, M (a rebuke of evil, written in
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
Description:
Celestial)
You create a sword of pure white fire in your free hand.
The blade is similar in size and shape to a longsword, and
it lasts for the duration. The blade disappears if you let go
of it, but you can call it forth again as a bonus action.
You can use your action to make a melee spell attack
with the blade. On a hit, the target takes 2d8 fire damage
and 2d8 radiant damage. An aberration, fey, fiend, or
undead creature damaged by the blade must succeed on
a Wisdom saving throw or be frightened until the start of
your next turn.
The blade sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim
light for an additional 20 feet.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell
slot of 4th level or higher, either the fire damage or the
radiant damage (your choice) increases by 1d8 for each slot
level above 3rd.
=== SPELL END ===

=== SPELL START ===
Name: BLAZING CHARIOT
Level: 5
School: Conjuration
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 30 feet
Components: V, S, M (a small golden wheel worth 250 gp)
Duration: 1 hour
Description:
Calling upon the might of the angels, you conjure a
flaming chariot made of gold and mithral in an unoccupied
10-foot-square space you can see within range. Two horses
made of fire and light pull the chariot. You and up to
three other Medium or smaller creatures you designate
can board the chariot (at the cost of 5 feet of movement)
and are unharmed by the flames. Any other creature that
touches the chariot or hits it (or a creature riding in it) with
a melee attack while within 5 feet of the chariot takes 3d6
fire damage and 3d6 radiant damage. The chariot has AC 18
and 50 hit points, is immune to fire, poison, psychic, and
radiant damage, and has resistance to all other nonmagical
damage. The horses are not separate creatures but are part
of the chariot. The chariot vanishes if it is reduced to 0 hit
points, and any creature riding it falls out. The chariot has a
speed of 50 feet and a flying speed of 40 feet.
On your turn, you can guide the chariot in place of your
own movement. You can use a bonus action to direct it to
take the Dash, Disengage, or Dodge action. As an action,
you can use the chariot to overrun creatures in its path. On
this turn, the chariot can enter a hostile creature’s space.
The creature takes damage as if it had touched the chariot,
is shunted to the nearest unoccupied space that it can
occupy, and must make a successful Strength saving throw
or fall prone in that space.
=== SPELL END ===

=== SPELL START ===
Name: BLESSED HALO
Level: 2
School: Evocation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Description:
A nimbus of golden light surrounds your head for the
duration. The halo sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius
and dim light for an additional 20 feet.
This spell grants you a pool of 10 points of healing. When
you cast the spell and as an action on subsequent turns
during the spell’s duration, you can expend points from
this pool to restore an equal number of hit points to one
creature within 20 feet that you can see.
Additionally, you have advantage on Charisma checks
made against good creatures within 20 feet.
If any of the light created by this spell overlaps an area of
magical darkness created by a spell of 2nd level or lower,
the spell that created the darkness is dispelled.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell
slot of 3rd level or higher, the spell’s pool of healing points
increases by 5 for each spell slot above 2nd, and the spell
dispels magical darkness created by a spell of a level equal
to the slot used to cast this spell.
=== SPELL END ===

=== SPELL START ===
Name: CELESTIAL FANFARE
Level: 6
School: Evocation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 100 feet
Components: V, S, M (miniature trumpet worth 100 gp)
Duration: Instantaneous
Description:
A great blaring of trumpets from on high blasts down
upon an area you designate. All evil creatures in a 30-foot
radius take 4d6 thunder damage and 4d6 radiant damage
and are blinded and deafened for 2d4 rounds. A successful
Constitution saving throw reduces the damage and the
duration of the blinded and deafened conditions by half.
Neutral or unaligned creatures within the area take
half as much damage and are blinded and deafened for
1d4 rounds. A successful save reduces the damage to
one-quarter and negates the blinding and deafening effects.
Good-aligned creatures are not harmed by this spell.
DEVA’S WINGS
=== SPELL END ===

=== SPELL START ===
Name: DEVA’S WINGS
Level: 4
School: Transmutation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M (a wing feather from any bird)
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
Description:
You touch a willing creature. The target grows feathery
wings of pure white that grant it a flying speed of 60 feet
and the ability to hover. When the target takes the Attack
action, it can use a bonus action to make a melee weapon
attack with the wings, with a reach of 10 feet. If the wing
attack hits, the target takes bludgeoning damage equal to
1d6 + your spellcasting ability modifier and must make a
successful Strength saving throw or fall prone. When the
spell ends, the wings disappear, and the target falls if it
was aloft.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell
slot of 5th level or higher, you can target one additional
target for each slot level above 4th.
9th-level abjuration (ritual) (angelic)
Casting Time: 1 minute
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M (incense and special inks worth
500 gp, which the spell consumes)
Duration: 24 hours
You inscribe an angelic seal on the ground, the floor,
or other solid surface of a structure. The seal creates a
spherical sanctuary with a radius of 100 feet, centered on
the seal. For the duration, aberrations, elementals, fey,
fiends, and undead that approach to within 5 feet of the
boundary know they are about to come into contact with
a deadly barrier. If such a creature moves so as to touch
the boundary, or tries to cross the boundary by any means,
including teleportation and extradimensional travel, it
must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, it
takes 15d8 radiant damage, is repelled to 5 feet outside the
boundary, and can’t target anything inside the boundary
with attacks, spells, or abilities until the spell ends. On a
successful save, the creature takes half as much radiant
damage and can cross the boundary. If the creature is
a fiend that isn’t on its home plane, it is immediately
destroyed (no saving throw) instead of taking damage.
Aberrations, elementals, fey, and undead that are
within 100 feet of the seal (inside the boundary) have
disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, and saving
throws, and each such creature takes 4d8 radiant damage
at the start of its turn.
Creatures other than aberrations, elementals, fey,
fiends, and undead can’t be charmed or frightened while
within 100 feet of the seal.
The seal has AC 18, 75 hit points, resistance to
bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, and
immunity to psychic and poison damage. Ranged attacks
against the seal are made with disadvantage. If it is scribed
on the surface of an object that is later destroyed (such as
a wooden door), the seal is not damaged and remains in
place, perhaps suspended in midair. The spell ends only if
the seal itself is reduced to 0 hit points.
=== SPELL END ===

=== SPELL START ===
Name: QUINTESSENCE
Level: 8
School: Transmutation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self (120-foot radius)
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Description:
By calling upon an archangel, you become infused with
celestial essence and take on angelic features such as
golden skin, glowing eyes, and ethereal wings. For the
duration of the spell, your Armor Class can’t be lower
than 20, you can’t be frightened, and you are immune to
necrotic damage.
In addition, each hostile creature that starts its turn
within 120 feet of you or enters that area for the first time
on a turn must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or
be frightened for 1 minute. A creature frightened in this
way is restrained. A frightened creature can repeat the
saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the
effect on itself on a success. If a creature’s saving throw
is successful or if the effect ends for it, the creature is
immune to the frightening effect of the spell until you cast
quintessence again.
7th-level abjuration (ritual) (angelic)
Casting Time: 1 minute
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M (incense and special inks worth
250 gp, which the spell consumes)
Duration: 24 hours
You inscribe an angelic seal on the ground, the floor,
or other solid surface of a structure. The seal creates a
spherical sanctuary with a radius of 50 feet, centered on
the seal. For the duration, aberrations, elementals, fey,
fiends, and undead that approach to within 5 feet of the
boundary know they are about to come into contact with
a deadly barrier. If such a creature moves so as to touch
the boundary, or tries to cross the boundary by any means,
including teleportation and extradimensional travel, it
must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, it
takes 10d8 radiant damage, is repelled to 5 feet outside the
boundary, and can’t target anything inside the boundary
with attacks, spells, or abilities until the spell ends. On a
successful save, the creature takes half as much radiant
damage and can cross the boundary. If the creature is
a fiend that isn’t on its home plane, it is immediately
destroyed (no saving throw) instead of taking damage.
Aberrations, elementals, fey, and undead that are
within 50 feet of the seal (inside the boundary) have
disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, and saving
throws, and each such creature takes 2d8 radiant damage
at the start of its turn.
Creatures other than aberrations, elementals, fey,
fiends, and undead can’t be charmed or frightened while
within 50 feet of the seal.
The seal has AC 18, 50 hit points, resistance to
bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, and
immunity to psychic and poison damage. Ranged attacks
against the seal are made with disadvantage. If it is scribed
on the surface of an object that is later destroyed (such as
a wooden door), the seal is not damaged and remains in
place, perhaps suspended in midair. The spell ends only if
the seal is reduced to 0 hit points.
An angelic scribe studies the angelic seals that harness the
power of celestial messengers through their names and
shapes that power into magical effects. Beyond the seals
and wardings themselves, you learn esoteric spells to call
down the essence of the angelic host.
Most angelic scribes take up their craft out of reverence
and a desire to protect the righteous; a few tempt angelic
wrath with their lust for power that’s otherwise beyond
their grasp.
How to Start: If you’re a wizard who wants to become
an angelic scribe, you make that decision upon reaching
2nd level, when you are also entitled to choose an arcane
tradition. If you decide to follow the path of the angelic
scribe exclusively, you can forego the selection of an
arcane tradition and gain the features of the angelic scribe
specialty instead.
You can also pursue the angelic scribe specialty in
conjunction with one of the standard arcane traditions. If
you choose to do this, you gain the Savant feature of your
chosen school in addition to Angelic Savant (described
below). Also at 2nd level, you choose whether to gain Seal
Scribe (see below) or the 2nd-level feature of your chosen
school. Thereafter, at 6th, 10th, and 14th level, you choose
between the lowest-level features still available. For
instance, a conjurer might select Seal Scribe at 2nd level
and Minor Conjuration at 6th level, followed by either
Warding Seal or Benign Transposition at 10th level.
For a cleric, the process is much the same except that it
involves making choices between angelic scribe features
and the features provided by your domain. These decisions
occur at 2nd, 6th, 8th, and 17th level instead of at the levels
indicated for wizards.
Paladins, although they can cast angelic spells and gain
angelic feats, cannot become angelic scribes.
Beginning when you take up this specialty at 2nd level, the
gold and time you must spend to copy an angelic spell into
your spellbook is halved.
Also at 2nd level, you learn the Celestial language if you
don’t already know it, and you gain the ability to scribe
angelic seals.
Seals. You learn two angelic seals of your choice, which
are detailed below under “Angelic Seals.” You can spend
10 minutes scribing an angelic seal you know on paper,
canvas, stone tiles, or some other surface or object that
can be carried or displayed. Alternatively, you can spend
8 hours using appropriate artisan tools to carve or etch a
more permanent seal into harder material. Once you have
scribed a seal, you can activate it as an action.
• You can have one seal active at a time. The number of
active seals you can maintain increases by one at 6th
level (two seals), 10th level (three seals), and 14th level
(four seals).
• A seal’s magic is suppressed while you are
concentrating on maintaining a spell or a similar effect.
A suppressed seal still counts against the number of
active seals you can maintain.
• As a bonus action, you can deactivate a seal prior
to activating another one. A broken or defaced seal
deactivates immediately and must be replaced.
• You can give an active seal to another creature, enabling
it to gain the benefit of the seal while it holds or openly
wears the seal, except when it is concentrating on
maintaining a spell or a similar effect.
• You learn one additional angelic seal of your choice at
6th, 10th, and 14th levels. Each time you learn a new
seal, you can also replace one seal you know with a
different one.
Beginning at 6th level, you can place warding seals to
protect areas. This follows the procedure for scribing
an angelic seal, but a warding seal must be fashioned on
the ground, the floor, or a similarly suitable portion of a
structure such as a wall, column, or ceiling. As an action,
you can touch the seal to activate it. You must maintain
concentration on the effect as if concentrating on a spell.
Once activated, a warding seal creates a spherical
“safe space” that extends out to 30 feet around it, large
enough to surround a small building or series of rooms
of appropriate dimensions (a 22-foot cube, for example,
or any space of approximately 11,000 cubic feet). An
aberration, fey, fiend, or undead cannot physically cross
the boundary, cast spells through it, or project its abilities
across the boundary unless it makes a successful Charisma
saving throw against your spell save DC. A creature that
fails the saving throw can try again on its next turn. A
creature that makes a sucessful save and moves across
the boundary into the protected area isn’t affected by the
boundary while it remains inside (the boundary impedes
only incoming entities and effects, not outgoing ones), but
it must contend with the ward again if it leaves the area
and tries to reenter.
Starting at 10th level (or 8th level for a cleric), you can
use an action to empower one of your active angelic
seals or warding seals to greater effect. If you choose an
angelic seal, its user typically gains the greater benefit of
the seal for 1 minute (unless otherwise noted), replacing
the normal benefit during that time. If you choose a
warding seal, for the next hour a creature that fails its
saving throw against the ward takes 6d6 radiant damage
and automatically fails additional saves against the ward
during this time.
You can use this ability twice, and you regain expended
uses when you finish a short or long rest.
At 14th level (or 17th level for a cleric), you add conjure
celestial to your spellbook or your spells known if you don’t
already know it.
Additionally, you can use a bonus action to infuse
your seals with angelic wrath. For 1 minute, you deal an
additional 1d8 radiant damage with weapon attacks—and
so does anyone within 30 feet of you that is in possession
of one of your active seals.
You can’t use this ability again until you finish a short or
long rest.
Each angelic seal consists of the name of an angel, written
in Celestial on a suitable surface, that resonates with a
given seal’s effect.
Amnayeth (Benevolence). This seal allows the user to
reroll a failed ability check to improve another creature’s
attitude. Greater: As an action once during the next
minute, the user can cause a creature that can hear the
user to make a successful Wisdom saving throw against
your spell save DC or be charmed for 10 minutes.
This seal can’t be used again on a check involving the
same creature until the user finishes a short or long rest.
Simil (Clarity). The user adds half your Intelligence
modifier (minimum of 1) to its Wisdom (Insight) and
Wisdom (Perception) checks for 1 minute. Greater: The
user gains blindsight out to a range of 10 feet.
Rikbil (Fortitude). When it is hit with an attack, the user
can use its reaction to add 2 to its AC against that attack. It
must be able to see the attacker to use this effect. Greater:
The user gains resistance to nonmagical bludgeoning,
piercing, and slashing damage.
Barrateth (Fortune). The user can add 1 to an attack roll,
saving throw, or ability check. The addition is made after
rolling the die but before the GM reveals whether it was
a success or failure. Greater: After making an attack roll,
saving throw, or ability check, the user can roll another
d20 and choose which result to use. The second roll is
made after the initial roll but before the GM reveals
whether that roll was a success or failure.
This seal can’t be used again until the user finishes a
short or long rest.
Vrechiel (Glory). When the user reduces an enemy to 0
hit points, the user gains temporary hit points equal to
your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1). Greater: At
the start of its turn once during the next minute, the user
gains temporary hit points equal to your caster level.
Ophanim (Humility). The user adds half your
Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1) to its Dexterity
(Stealth) checks. It keeps this benefit until the start
of its next turn when it takes a hostile action (any
action that could inflict intentional damage
on a creature). Greater: If it hasn’t taken a
hostile action this turn, the user can use
its action to present an aura of humility.
A creature that wants to attack the user
must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw
against your spell save DC or choose
another target. If there are no other
targets it can attack, the creature spends
its action doing nothing.
Chamule (Judgment). When the user
hits a creature with an opportunity attack,
the user can move up to half its speed,
provided it ends the move no farther
away from the creature it hit. Greater: As a
reaction when it is hit with an attack once
during the next minute, the user can cause
the attacker to take radiant damage equal to
your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1) if the attacker is
within 60 feet of the user.
Jelaal (Recovery). The user automatically succeeds on
its first death saving throw and then regains 1 hit point.
Greater: When the user regains hit points, it regains an
additional number of hit points equal to your Intelligence
modifier (minimum of 1). Once it is used, this seal doesn’t
function again until the user finishes a short or long rest.
Iaothe (Temperance). When it makes a Wisdom saving
throw, the user can use its reaction to add your Intelligence
modifier (minimum of 1) to the roll. The bonus is added
after the die is rolled but before the GM reveals whether
the saving throw succeeds or fails. Greater: The user can’t
be charmed or frightened.
Once it is used, this seal doesn’t function again until the
user finishes a short or long rest.
Xapanie (Wrath). Once on the user’s turn when it
hits with a weapon attack, the attack gains a +1 bonus to
damage. Greater: The user’s attacks are magical, and once
on the user’s turn during the next minute when it hits with
a weapon attack, the attack deals additional radiant damage
equal to half your caster level (minimum of 1).
There exists a form of raw arcane power with no rules or
structure—only an unthinking addiction to changing
the reality with which it comes into contact. This force
is known as chaos magic. Those who learn to channel
this energy eventually expand and aid this magic in its
chaos; to master it, though, chaos demands an emotional
price of extreme highs and lows. An eccentric lifestyle
or even full-on madness is common among chaos magic
specialists, who are collectively known as chaos mages.

=== SPELL START ===
Name: BABBLE
Level: 5
School: Enchantment
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour
Description:
This spell causes the speech of affected creatures to sound
like nonsense. Each creature in a 30-foot-radius sphere
centered on a point you choose within range must succeed
on an Intelligence saving throw when you cast this spell or
be affected by it.
An affected creature cannot communicate in any spoken
language that it knows. When it speaks, the words come
out as gibberish. Spells with verbal components cannot be
cast. The spell does not affect telepathic communication,
nonverbal communication, or sounds emitted by any
creature that does not have a spoken language. As an
action, a creature under the effect of this spell can attempt
another Intelligence saving throw against the effect. On a
successful save, the spell ends.

Name: BAD TIMING
Level: 2
School: Divination
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V
Duration: Instantaneous
Description:
You point toward a creature that you can see and twist
strands of chaotic energy around its fate. If the target gets
a failure on a Charisma saving throw, the next attack roll
or ability check the creature attempts within 10 minutes is
made with disadvantage.

Name: CALM OF THE STORM
Level: 3
School: Abjuration
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M (an amethyst worth 250 gp, which
Duration: Instantaneous
Description:
the spell consumes)
While visualizing the world as you wish it was, you lay
your hands upon a creature other than yourself and undo
the effect of a chaos magic surge that affected the creature
within the last minute. Reality reshapes itself as if the
surge never happened, but only for that creature.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell
slot of 4th level or higher, the time since the chaos magic
surge can be 1 minute longer for each slot level above 3rd.
=== SPELL END ===

=== SPELL START ===
Name: CHAOTIC FORM
Level: 4
School: Transmutation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Duration: 10 minutes
Description:
You cause the form of a willing creature to become
malleable, dripping and flowing according to the target’s
will as if the creature were a vaguely humanoid-shaped
ooze. The creature is not affected by difficult terrain, it has
advantage on Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks made to escape
a grapple, and it suffers no penalties when squeezing
through spaces one size smaller than itself. The target’s
movement is halved while it is affected by chaotic form.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
spell slot of 5th level or higher, the duration increases by 10
minutes for each slot level above 4th.
=== SPELL END ===

=== SPELL START ===
Name: CHAOTIC VITALITY
Level: 2
School: Conjuration
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous
Description:
Make a melee spell attack against a creature that has a
number of Hit Dice no greater than your level and has
at least 1 hit point. On a hit, you conjure pulsating waves
of chaotic energy within the creature and yourself. After
a brief moment that seems to last forever, your hit point
total changes, as does the creature’s. Roll a d100 and
increase or decrease the number rolled by any number up
to your spellcasting level, then find the result on the Hit
Point Flux table. Apply that result both to yourself and the
target creature. Any hit points gained beyond a creature’s
normal maximum are temporary hit points that last for 1
round per caster level.
For example, a 3rd-level spellcaster who currently has
17 of her maximum 30 hit points casts chaotic vitality on a
creature with 54 hit points and rolls a 75 on the Hit Point
Flux table. The two creatures have a combined total of 71
hit points. A result of 75 indicates that both creatures get
50 percent of the total, so the spellcaster and the target
end up with 35 hit points each. In the spellcaster’s case, 5 of
those hit points are temporary and will last for 3 rounds.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the maximum Hit Dice
of the affected creature increases by 2 for each slot level
above 2nd.
01–09 0
10–39 1
40–69 25 percent of total
70–84 50 percent of total
85–94 75 percent of total
95–99 100 percent of total
100 200 percent of total, and both creatures gain the
effect of a haste spell that lasts for 1 round per
caster level

Name: CHAOTIC WORLD
Level: 6
School: Illusion
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, M (seven irregular pieces of colored
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Description:
cloth that you throw into the air)
You throw a handful of colored cloth into the air while
screaming a litany of disjointed phrases. A moment later,
a 30-foot cube centered on a point within range fills with
multicolored light, cacophonous sound, overpowering
scents, and other confusing sensory information. The
effect is dizzying and overwhelming. Each enemy within
the cube must make a successful Intelligence saving throw
or become blinded and deafened, and fall prone. An affected
enemy cannot stand up or recover from the blindness or
deafness while within the area, but all three conditions end
immediately for a creature that leaves the spell’s area.

Name: ELEMENTAL TWIST
Level: 2
School: Evocation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self

around itself)
During this spell’s duration, reality shifts around you
whenever you cast a spell that deals acid, cold, fire,
lightning, poison, or thunder damage. Assign each
damage type a number and roll a d6 to determine the type
of damage this casting of the spell deals. In addition, the
spell’s damage increases by 1d6. All other properties or
effects of the spell are unchanged.
=== SPELL END ===

=== SPELL START ===
Name: ENTROPIC DAMAGE FIELD
Level: 3
School: Transmutation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S, M (a silver wire)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Description:
By twisting a length of silver wire around your finger, you
tie your fate to those around you. When you take damage,
that damage is divided equally between you and all
creatures in range who get a failure on a Charisma saving
throw. Any leftover damage that can’t be divided equally
is taken by you. Creatures that approach to within 60 feet
of you after the spell was cast are also affected. A creature
is allowed a new saving throw against this spell each time
you take damage, and a successful save ends the spell’s
effect on that creature.
=== SPELL END ===

=== SPELL START ===
Name: FLUCTUATING ALIGNMENT
Level: 4
School: Enchantment
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 120 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
Description:
You channel the force of chaos to taint your target’s mind.
A target that gets a failure on a Wisdom saving throw must
roll 1d20 and consult the Alignment Fluctuation table to
find its new alignment, and it must roll again after every
minute of the spell’s duration. The target’s alignment stops
fluctuating and returns to normal when the spell ends.
These changes do not make the affected creature friendly
or hostile toward the caster, but they can cause creatures to
behave in unpredictable ways.

Name: FRENZIED BOLT
Level: 2
School: Evocation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 120 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous
Description:
You direct a bolt of rainbow colors toward a creature
of your choice within range. If the bolt hits, the target
takes 3d8 damage, of a type determined by rolling on the
Random Damage Type table. If your attack roll (not the
adjusted result) was odd, the bolt leaps to a new target of
your choice within range that has not already been targeted
by frenzied bolt, requiring a new spell attack roll to hit. The
bolt continues leaping to new targets until you roll an even
number on your spell attack roll, miss a target, or run out
of potential targets. You and your allies are legal targets for
this spell, if you are particularly lucky—or unlucky.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell
slot of 3rd level or higher, you create an additional bolt for
each slot level above 2nd. Each potential target can be hit
only once by each casting of the spell, not once per bolt.
ILL-FATED WORD

=== SPELL START ===
Name: ILL-FATED WORD
Level: 1
School: Divination
Casting Time: 1 reaction, which you take when an
Range: 30 feet
Components: V
Duration: Instantaneous
Description:
enemy makes an attack roll, ability check, or saving
throw
You call out a distracting epithet to a creature, worsening
its chance to succeed at whatever it’s doing. Roll a d4 and
subtract the number rolled from an attack roll, ability
check, or saving throw that the target has just made; the
target uses the lowered result to determine the outcome
of its roll.
=== SPELL END ===

=== SPELL START ===
Name: MASS SURGE DAMPENER
Level: 5
School: Abjuration
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 30 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 minute, or until expended
Description:
Using your strength of will, you protect up to three
creatures other than yourself from the effect of a chaos
magic surge. A protected creature can make a DC 13
Charisma saving throw to negate the effect of a chaos
magic surge that does not normally allow a saving throw,
or it gains advantage on a saving throw that is normally
allowed. Once a protected creature makes a successful
saving throw allowed by mass surge dampener, the spell’s
effect ends for that creature.
=== SPELL END ===

=== SPELL START ===
Name: MISFORTUNE
Level: 6
School: Necromancy
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S, M (a broken mirror)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Description:
You cast a pall of bad luck over all creatures in a 15-foot
radius centered on a point within range. Each creature
in that area must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or
be cursed with bad luck for the duration of the spell. A
creature under the effect of this spell has disadvantage on
all ability checks, saving throws, and attack rolls. A remove
curse spell ends this effect.
Special. If a targeted creature is carrying a stone of good
luck, the creature is unaffected by the spell, but the item
ceases to function for 24 hours. Likewise, if a targeted
creature is carrying a luck blade, the creature is unaffected
by the spell, but the sword’s Luck ability and saving throw
bonuses cease to function for 24 hours.
=== SPELL END ===

=== SPELL START ===
Name: MIST OF WONDERS
Level: 2
School: Conjuration
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self (30-foot radius)
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 minute
Description:
A colorful mist surrounds you out to a radius of 30 feet.
Creatures inside the mist see odd shapes in it and hear
random sounds that don’t make sense. The very concepts
of order and logic don’t seem to exist inside the mist.
Any 1st-level spell that’s cast in the mist by another caster
or that travels through the mist is affected by its strange
nature. The caster must make a Constitution saving
throw when casting the spell. On a failed save, the spell
transforms into another 1st-level spell the caster knows
(chosen by the GM from those available), even if that spell
is not currently prepared. The altered spell’s slot level or its
original target or targeted area can’t be changed. Cantrips
are unaffected. If (in the GM’s judgment) none of the
caster’s spells known of that level can be transformed, the
spell being cast simply fails.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
spell slot of 3rd level or higher, it affects any spell cast
using a spell slot of any lower level. For instance, using a
6th-level slot enables you to transform a spell of 5th level
or lower into another spell of the same level.
=== SPELL END ===

=== SPELL START ===
Name: PARAGON OF CHAOS
Level: 8
School: Transmutation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self
Components: V
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Description:
You become a humanoid-shaped swirling mass of color
and sound. You gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing,
and slashing damage, and immunity to poison and
psychic damage. You are also immune to the following
conditions: exhaustion, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned,
and unconscious. Finally, you gain truesight to 30 feet and
can teleport 30 feet as a move.
Each round, as a bonus action, you can cause an
automatic chaos magic surge, choosing either yourself or
another creature you can see within 60 feet as the caster
for the purpose of resolving the effect. You must choose
the target before rolling percentile dice to determine the
nature of the surge. The DC of any required saving throw
is calculated as if you were the caster.
=== SPELL END ===

=== SPELL START ===
Name: ROAMING PAIN
Level: 1
School: Necromancy
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 30 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Description:
You afflict a single humanoid within range with severe
pain in a random part of its body. Roll a d6 and consult the
table to determine the spell’s initial effect.
D
1 Head Incapacitated
2 Throat Unable to speak coherently or cast
spells with verbal components
3 Chest Cannot take reactions or bonus actions
4 Abdomen Disadvantage on Constitution saving
throws
5 Arm Disadvantage on attack rolls, Strength
and Dexterity skill checks
6 Leg Movement halved
The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On
a successful save, it is able to function despite the pain
and ignore the effects. At the start of the target’s turn each
round for the duration of the spell, roll again on the table
to see where the pain affects the target in that round.

=== SPELL START ===
Name: ROARING WINDS OF LIMBO
Level: 8
School: Conjuration
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 150 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Description:
You tear open a breach to the planes of chaos, and the
act of doing so fills an area with a dangerous windstorm.
The area consists of twelve 10-foot cubes, which you can
arrange as you wish. Each cube must have at least one face
in common with a face of another cube. Each creature
in the area is deafened, and any sound it makes cannot
be heard outside the area. The wind disperses all gases
and vapors and extinguishes all unprotected flames in
the area, and has a 75 percent chance of extinguishing
protected flames, such as lanterns. All Wisdom
(Perception) checks that rely on sight made by a creature
in the area have disadvantage due to the dust, grit, and
debris being cast about.
Each creature in the area must make a Strength saving
throw at the start of its turn. On a failed save, the creature
is pushed 15 feet in a random direction. (Roll a d8,
designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on
around the points of the compass.) The wind also hampers
movement; a creature in the area must spend 2 feet of
movement for every 1 foot it moves.
As a bonus action on each of your turns, you can bombard
up to twelve creatures in the area with flying debris, dealing
2d10 bludgeoning, 2d10 piercing, and 2d10 slashing
damage. A creature that makes a successful Dexterity
saving throw takes half the damage.
=== SPELL END ===

=== SPELL START ===
Name: SHIFTING THE ODDS
Level: 2
School: Divination
Casting Time: 1 bonus action
Range: Self
Components: V
Duration: Instantaneous
Description:
By wrapping yourself in strands of chaotic energy, you
gain advantage on the next attack roll or ability check that
you make. Fate is a cruel mistress, however, and her scales
must always be balanced. The second attack roll or ability
check (whichever occurs first) that you make after casting
shifting the odds is made with disadvantage.
=== SPELL END ===

=== SPELL START ===
Name: SURGE DAMPENER
Level: 3
School: Abjuration
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 minute, until expended
Description:
Using your strength of will, you cause one creature
other than yourself that you touch to become so firmly
entrenched within reality that it is protected from the
effects of a chaos magic surge. The protected creature can
make a DC 13 Charisma saving throw to negate the effect
of a chaos magic surge that does not normally allow a
saving throw, or it gains advantage on a saving throw that
is normally allowed. Once the protected creature makes
a successful saving throw allowed by surge dampener, the
spell ends.

Name: TIMELY DISTRACTION
Level: 2
School: Evocation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 25 feet
Components: V, S, M (a handful of sand or dirt thrown
Duration: 3 rounds
Description:
in the air)
You call forth a swirling, crackling wave of constantly
shifting pops, flashes, and swept-up debris. This chaos
can confound one creature. If the target gets a failure on a
Wisdom saving throw, roll a d4 and consult the following
table to determine the result. An affected creature can
repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns,
ending the effect on itself on a success. Otherwise, the
spell ends when its duration expires.
D
1 Blinded
2 Stunned
3 Deafened
4 Prone
D
1 A spindly third arm sprouts from your shoulder. As a bonus action, you can use it to attack with a light weapon. You
have advantage on Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) checks and any checks that require the manipulation of tools.
2 Your skin is covered by rough scales that increase your AC by 1 and give you resistance to a random damage type (roll
on the Damage Type table in the frenzied bolt spell description).
3 A puckered orifice grows on your back. You can forcefully expel air from it, granting you a flying speed of 30 feet.
You must land at the end of your turn. In addition, as a bonus action, you can try to push a creature away with a
blast of air. The target is pushed 5 feet away from you if it fails a Strength saving throw with a DC equal to 10 + your
Constitution modifier.
4 A second face appears on the back of your head. You gain darkvision out to a range of 120 feet and advantage on
sight-based and scent-based Wisdom (Perception) checks. You become adept at carrying on conversations with
yourself.
5 You grow gills that not only allow you to breathe underwater but also filter poison out of the air. You gain immunity
to inhaled poisons.
6 Your hindquarters elongate, and you grow a second set of legs. Your base walking speed increases by 10 feet, and your
carrying capacity becomes your Strength score multiplied by 20.
7 You become incorporeal and can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. You take
1d10 force damage if you end your turn inside an object. You can’t pick up or interact with physical objects that you
weren’t carrying when you became incorporeal.
8 Your limbs elongate and flatten into prehensile paddles. You gain a swimming speed equal to your base walking
speed and have advantage on Strength (Athletics) checks made to climb or swim. In addition, your unarmed strikes
deal 1d6 bludgeoning damage.
9 Your head fills with a light gas and swells to four times its normal size, causing your hair to fall out. You have
advantage on Intelligence and Wisdom ability checks and can levitate up to 5 feet above the ground.
10 You grow three sets of feathered wings that give you a flying speed equal to your walking speed and the ability to hover.

=== SPELL START ===
Name: UNCONTROLLABLE TRANSFORMATION
Level: 7
School: Transmutation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self
Components: V, S, M (the bill of a platypus)
Duration: 1 hour
Description:
You infuse your body with raw chaos and will it to
adopt a helpful mutation. Roll a d10 and consult
the Uncontrollable Transformation table below to
determine what mutation occurs. You can try to control
the shifting of your body to gain a mutation you prefer,
but doing so is taxing; you can roll a d10 twice and
choose the result you prefer, but you gain one level of
exhaustion. At the end of the spell, your body returns to
its normal form.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
spell slot of 8th level or higher, you gain an additional
mutation for each slot level above 7th. You gain one level
of exhaustion for each mutation you try to control.
=== SPELL END ===

=== SPELL START ===
Name: UNDERMINE ARMOR
Level: 1
School: Transmutation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 30 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Description:
You unravel the bonds of reality that hold a suit of armor
together. A target wearing armor must succeed on a
Constitution saving throw or its armor softens to the
consistency of candle wax, decreasing the target’s AC by 2.
Undermine armor has no effect on creatures that aren’t
wearing armor.
=== SPELL END ===

=== SPELL START ===
Name: UNRULY ITEM
Level: 1
School: Transmutation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 30 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Description:
You animate an object in the possession of a creature
within range, giving the object limited movement and
a compulsion to thwart its possessor. The
effect of the spell varies depending on the
kind of object you affect.
Weapon: A weapon being wielded
by a creature fights and twists,
trying to free itself from
the creature’s grasp. The
creature must make a
Dexterity saving throw.
On a failed save, the
creature has disadvantage on
any attacks it makes in that round with
the weapon. On a save that fails by 5 or
more, the creature drops the weapon.
Armor: The creature’s armor shifts
and moves, becoming noisy and
uncomfortable. If the armor does
not normally impart disadvantage
on Dexterity (Stealth) checks,
it does so while this spell
is in effect. The creature
wearing it must succeed on
a Dexterity saving throw or
take a 10-foot penalty to
its speed and be unable to
use the Dash action.
Other Items: The effects on other carried items can
vary at the GM’s discretion. A potion might behave as
a weapon, trying not to be drunk, falling to the ground
and becoming ruined if the Dexterity save is failed by 5 or
more. A backpack might try to empty itself, disgorging a
random item each round on a failed save.

=== SPELL START ===
Name: UNSHACKLED MAGIC
Level: 9
School: Enchantment
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 120 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Description:
You designate a creature within range that has the
Spellcasting or Innate Spellcasting special trait and imbue
it with wild magic, causing it to lose control of its magical
ability. If the target gets a failure on a Charisma saving
throw, then on its next turn, it rolls randomly to select one
of its available spells. The target then spontaneously casts
that spell as an action. If the spell can be cast using a spell
slot higher than its level, roll randomly to determine what
slot is used to cast the spell. The target still determines
factors such as the location of the spell’s area or which
creatures it affects, as normal, but it is compelled to cast
that particular spell at that particular time.
Each round while this spell remains in effect, the target
makes another Charisma saving throw. On a successful
save, it can act normally in that round, but the unshackled
magic spell does not end.
=== SPELL END ===

=== SPELL START ===
Name: WILD SHIELD
Level: 4
School: Abjuration
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 minute
Description:
You surround yourself with the forces of chaos. Wild lights
and strange sounds engulf you, making stealth impossible.
While wild shield is active, you can use a reaction to repel
a spell of 4th level or lower that targets you or whose area
you are within. A repelled spell has no effect on you, but
doing this causes the chance of a chaos magic surge as if
you had cast a spell, with you considered the caster for any
effect of the surge.
Wild shield ends when the duration expires or
when it absorbs 4 levels of spells. If you try to
repel a spell whose level exceeds the number
of levels remaining, make an ability check
using your spellcasting ability. The DC
equals 10 + the spell’s level – the number of
levels wild shield can still repel. If the check
succeeds, the spell is repelled; if the check
fails, the spell has its full effect. The chance of a
chaos magic surge exists regardless of whether
the spell is repelled.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell
using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can repel one
additional spell level for each slot level above 4th.

=== SPELL START ===
Name: WILD TRAJECTORY
Level: 7
School: Transmutation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 100 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Description:
You create a 30-foot cube of magical instability that
causes spell effects passing through it to diverge wildly
from their original paths. When a spell with a visible or
tangible manifestation (such as fireball, lightning bolt, or a
ray or projectile such as magic missile or ray of frost) passes
through the area, roll a d8. On a 1, the spell continues on
its original path or toward its original target; on a 2, it
diverts 45 degrees to the right; on a 3, it diverts 90 degrees
to the right; on a 4, it diverts 135 degrees to the right; on a
5, it turns 180 degrees, back the way it came (striking the
caster if it is a targeted spell); on a 6, the spell diverts 45
degrees to the left; on a 7, it diverts 90 degrees to the left;
on an 8, it diverts 135 degrees to the left.
A spell that affects anything in its path, such as lightning
bolt, continues to do so along its new trajectory, up to
the limit of its range. A fireball spell will travel in the new
direction up to the limit of its range before detonating.
A targeted spell will strike the first viable target it
encounters along its new trajectory.
Wizards who specialize in chaos magic crave an
understanding of probability and life’s unpredictable
outcomes to the point of obsession.
What starts as an attempt to analyze the patterns of chaos
quickly becomes a trip down the rabbit hole to madness.
How to Start: If you’re a wizard who wants to become an
entropist, you make that decision upon reaching 2nd level,
when you are also entitled to choose an arcane tradition. If
you decide to follow the path of the entropist exclusively,
you can forego the selection of an arcane tradition and
gain the features of the entropist specialty instead.
You can also pursue the entropist specialty in
conjunction with one of the standard arcane traditions.
If you choose to do this, you gain the Savant feature of
your chosen school in addition to Chaos Magic Savant
(described below). Also at 2nd level, you choose whether
to gain Long Odds (see below) or the 2nd-level feature
of your chosen school.
Thereafter, at 6th, 10th,
and 14th level, you choose
between the lowest-level
features still available. For
instance, a transmuter might
select Minor Alchemy at
2nd level and Long Odds at
6th level, followed by either
Transmuter’s Stone or Twisted
Arcana at 10th level.
Beginning when you take up this
specialty at 2nd level, the gold and time you
must spend to copy a chaos spell into your
spellbook is halved.
Also starting at 2nd level, you can manipulate
the reality-changing forces of chaos to alter the
odds in a situation. You can use a bonus action
to give yourself, or a reaction to give a
creature you can see, advantage on one attack roll, saving
throw, or ability check made during this turn. Using this
feature causes a chaos magic surge. You must finish a long
rest before you can use this feature again.
Starting at 6th level, when you cast a spell that deals
damage, you can infuse the effect with greater power by
channeling chaos through yourself. You make this choice
after determining that the spell has been successfully cast
(by making a spell attack roll) but before rolling damage.
If you decide to use this feature, roll a d6 + 1; this is the
maximum number of your spell’s

Using this feature has a chance of causing a chaos magic
surge. You must finish a long rest before you can use this
feature again.
Beginning at 10th level, when you cast a chaos spell, you
gain resistance to a random damage type for a number of
rounds equal to 1 + your Intelligence modifier (minimum
of 1). You can try to narrow the spell’s focus to a damage
type you prefer, but doing so has an element of risk; you
can roll twice on the Random Damage Type table and
choose the result you prefer, but you must also roll to see
if a chaos magic surge occurs. You must finish a long rest
before you can use this feature again.
Starting at 14th level, anytime you cause a chaos magic
surge, you regain one use of Long Odds, Twisted Arcana,
or Shifting Resistance without needing to finish a long
rest. In addition, every time you cast a chaos spell, you gain
temporary hit points equal to your Intelligence modifier +
the spell’s level.
Bards of the College of Entropy are itinerant gamblers
and daring thrill-seekers whose actions are supremely
unpredictable.
Rather than relying on ancient lore or skill with arms,
these bards throw themselves into new challenges just to
see what happens, trusting in luck to see them through.
They’re sometimes called luck stealers (with a mixture of
derision and respect), because no matter how bad things
get for everyone around them, these bards always seem to
come out unscathed.
When you join the College of Entropy at 3rd level,
you gain proficiency in Acrobatics and Athletics and
proficiency with a gaming set of your choice.
Also at 3rd level, you learn to borrow a little bit of
other people’s luck for yourself. When a creature
that you can see within 60 feet is about to make an
attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw with
advantage, you can use a reaction and expend
one of your uses of Bardic Inspiration. If you
do so, that creature takes a penalty to its die
roll equal to the number you roll on your
Bardic Inspiration die.
After the creature’s attack roll, ability check, or saving
throw is resolved, you gain the benefit of that Bardic
Inspiration die, which is usable only on yourself and lasts
only for a number of rounds equal to the roll of the Bardic
Inspiration die. If you do not use the benefit before that
time, it is lost.
For example, if you roll a 5 on your Bardic Inspiration
die, the creature takes a -5 penalty to its roll. You can
then apply a +5 bonus to one attack roll, ability check,
or saving throw that you make within the next 5
rounds.
Stealing luck, regardless of whether you use
the Bardic Inspiration benefit, causes a chance of a
chaos magic surge.
At 6th level, whenever you cast a chaos spell, you have a
chance of causing a chaos magic surge, and you regain one
use of your Bardic Inspiration. You regain the use of this
feature after you finish a short or long rest.
Everything desires to be something else. Starting at 14th
level, as an action, you can exchange one bard spell you
know for another bard spell of the same level or a lower
one. At the end of your next turn, your list of known
spells returns to normal. Using this ability has a chance of
causing a chaos magic surge.
D
1–2 You cast hypnotic pattern centered on yourself.
3–4 The target of your spell or ability is also targeted by an enlarge spell. If your spell or ability has no target, the
enlarge spell affects you.

17–18 You summon a mule 100 feet above the target of your spell or ability. If your spell or ability has no target, the
mule appears above you. Both the mule and the creature it lands on take 10d6 bludgeoning damage from the
inevitable fall, or the creature under the mule takes no damage with a successful Dexterity saving throw; the
DC is equal to your spell save DC.
19–20 You cast contact other plane.

31–32 Loud horns that can be heard for a mile sound for 1 hour. The sound moves with you.
33–34 Until you finish a long rest, every word you utter sounds normal to you but is heard by others as
incomprehensible babbling. This effect doesn’t impair your ability to cast spells.
35–36 Three creatures within 30 feet that you can see are targeted by a bolt of light that does 1d8 radiant damage.
Each target can avoid the damage with a successful Constitution saving throw.
37–38 Every creature within 60 feet of you, except you, teleports 10 feet in a random direction. If the destination is
a solid object or hazardous terrain, the creature doesn't move.
39–40 The sun (or the moon, at night) is eclipsed for 10 minutes.
41–42 You become immune to all damage for 1 round.
43–44 Until you finish a long rest, you leave burning footprints that smolder in your wake for 5 rounds. The flames
are hot enough to ignite easily flammable material.
45–46 You turn into a succulent cooked ham for 10 rounds. While a ham, you are incapacitated and have
vulnerability to all damage. The gold plate that you appear upon can be sold for 5 gp.
47–48 For 30 feet around you, the ground turns into broken, uneven, difficult terrain.
49–50 For 1 hour, you gain a bonus to weapon damage equal to your spellcasting ability modifier.
The use of chaos magic sometimes causes a chaos magic
surge. This phenomenon is similar to the wild magic
surge caused by some sorcerers. When a chaos magic
surge has a chance of occurring, the caster rolls a d20.
On a 1, roll percentile dice and consult the Chaos Magic
Surge table to determine the result.
51–52 You open a portal to the Abyss that stays open for 10 rounds. Each round there is a 1 in 20 chance that a fiend
or other Abyssal creature of the GM’s choice walks through.

regenerate spell.
57–58 You hear a thunderous sound and are stunned until the end of your next turn.
59–60 You cast moonbeam.
61–62 An item you hold is covered in a continual flame effect. If you are not holding an item, the GM chooses an item
within 30 feet of you to be the target.
63–64 You and two targets that you can see within 30 feet are affected by a bane spell.
65–66 You gain advantage on your next attack roll, ability check, or saving throw within 24 hours.
67–68 You have disadvantage on your next attack roll, ability check, or saving throw within 24 hours.

73–74 You are targeted by a disguise self spell making you appear as a dirt-covered human child of the opposite

centered on you.

also falls prone unless it makes a successful Dexterity saving throw.
87–88 Red silk scarves and origami cranes swirl through the air within 500 feet of you, causing the area to be

Some scholars believe that true magic springs only from
deep inside an individual creature, such as a dragon or
a demon, and those possessing bloodlines from such
terrible creatures can tap their personal magical stores.
Others speculate that magic comes only from other planes
of existence or from the gods themselves.
The truth is that magic comes from several sources, and
powerful beings can utilize any wellspring of magic to
craft spells and fuel seemingly miraculous effects. One
of the first creatures to master all types of magic were the
majestic and terrible dragons. Although they were capable
of controlling the elements and inducing terrible fear, they
also mastered more subtle magic. They wove a tapestry of
magic into their homes, giving their lairs innate defenses.
They taught their servants, from humans to kobolds to
elves, how to make use of the magic that permeated the
atmosphere. And they also passed on to their kin—both
true dragons and lesser creatures—the kind of magic that
roiled in blood and bone.
Dragon magic is a distinct branch of arcane study,
founded in the Draconic language and in an elemental
understanding of arcane forces.

=== SPELL END ===

=== SPELL START ===
Name: ASPECT OF THE DRAGON
Level: 7
School: Transmutation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self
Components: V, S, M (a dragon scale)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Description:
This spell draws out the ancient nature within your blood,
allowing you to assume the form of any dragon-type
creature of challenge 10 or less.
You assume the hit points and Hit Dice of the new form.
When you revert to your normal form, you return to the
number of hit points you had before you transformed.
If you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any
excess damage carries over to your normal form. As long
as the excess damage doesn’t reduce your normal form to
0 hit points, you aren’t knocked unconscious.
You retain the benefits of any features from your class,
race, or other source and can use them, provided that your
new form is physically capable of doing so. You can speak
only if the dragon can normally speak.
When you transform, you choose whether your
equipment falls to the ground, merges into the new form,
or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions normally, but
equipment doesn’t change shape or size to match the new
form. Any equipment that the new form can’t wear must
either fall to the ground or merge into the new form. The
GM has final say on whether the new form can wear or use
a particular piece of equipment. Equipment that merges
has no effect in that state.

Name: CATCH THE BREATH
Level: 3
School: Transmutation
Casting Time: 1 reaction, which you take when you
Range: Self
Components: V
Duration: Instantaneous
Description:
make a saving throw against a breath weapon attack
You can cast this spell as a reaction when you’re targeted
by a breath weapon. Doing so gives you advantage on your
saving throw against the breath weapon. If your saving
throw succeeds, you take no damage from the attack even
if a successful save normally only halves the damage.
Whether your saving throw succeeded or failed, you
absorb and store energy from the attack. On your next
turn, you can make a ranged spell attack against a target
within 60 feet. On a hit, the target takes 3d10 force
damage. If you opt not to make this attack, the stored
energy dissipates harmlessly.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage done by your
attack increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 3rd.
CAVE DRAGON’S DOMINANCE
=== SPELL END ===

abilities of the cave dragon, growing protective scales and
claws. Until the spell ends, your AC can’t be lower than

take two actions on your turn to attack with your claws,
dealing 1d6 slashing damage on a hit. You have resistance
to poison damage. Up to three times while the spell is
active, as an action, you can breathe a 20-foot cone of
poison gas, dealing 6d8 poison damage to each creature
in the cone and making it poisoned until it finishes a long
or short rest. A creature that succeeds on a Constitution
saving throw takes half as much damage from your breath
weapon and is not poisoned. Finally, you gain a climbing
speed of 40 feet.

Name: CLAIM LAIR
Level: 6
School: Abjuration
Casting Time: 10 minutes
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M (material goods and wealth worth
Duration: 24 hours
Description:
at least 2,000 gp)
By placing your personal wealth within an area and
invoking the dragon’s territorial nature, you claim the
area as your lair, imbuing you with extra power within its
confines. You can claim an area of up to 2,500 square feet
(a space 50 feet square, or one hundred 5-foot squares, or
twenty-five 10-foot squares). The claimed area can be up
to 20 feet tall and shaped as you desire. While within these
confines, you can take one of the following lair actions
once per round on initiative count 20:
• Magical darkness spreads from a point you choose
within 30 feet, filling a 15-foot-radius sphere until you
dismiss it as an action, use this lair action again, or
die. The darkness spreads around corners. A creature
with darkvision can’t see through this darkness, and
nonmagical light can’t illuminate it, but you can see in
the area as if it were brightly lit. If any of the effect’s area
overlaps with an area of light created by a spell of 2nd
level or lower, the spell that created the light is dispelled.
• Part of the ceiling collapses above one creature you can
see within 60 feet of you. The creature must succeed on
a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC or
take 3d6 bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone
and buried. A buried target is restrained and unable to
breathe or stand up. A creature can take an action to
make a DC 10 Strength check, ending the buried state
with a success.
• A tremor shakes the lair in a 30-foot radius around you.
Each creature on the ground in that area other than you
must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against your
spell save DC or be knocked prone.
You can take an action to dismiss this spell.

takes 6d8 bludgeoning damage from being slammed to
the ground. If the target was flying or levitating, it takes
an additional 1d6 bludgeoning damage per 10 feet it falls.
If the target makes a successful Strength saving throw,
damage is halved, it doesn’t fall, and it isn’t knocked prone.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell
slot of 6th level or higher, the damage done by the attack
increases by 1d8 and the range increases by 10 feet for each

with any creature within 120 feet of you that has the
dragon type, regardless of the creature’s languages. A
dragon can choose to make a Charisma saving throw to
prevent telepathic contact with itself.
This spell doesn’t change a dragon’s disposition
toward you or your allies, it only opens a channel of
communication. In some cases, unwanted telepathic
contact can worsen the dragon’s attitude toward you.

Range: Self
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
Description:
You can detect the presence of dragons and other
draconic creatures within your line of sight and 120
feet, regardless of disguises, illusions, and alteration
magic such as polymorph. The information you uncover
depends on the number of consecutive rounds you spend
an action studying a subject or area. On the first round of
examination, you detect whether any draconic creatures
are present, but not their number, location, identity, or
type. On the second round, you learn the number of such
creatures as well as the general condition of the most
powerful one. On the third and subsequent rounds, you
make a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check; if it succeeds,
you learn the age, type, and location of one draconic
creature. Note that the spell provides no information on
the turn in which it is cast, unless you have the means to
take a second action that turn.

but within that maximum, you can shape it as you like—
to follow the walls of a building or cave, for example.
While the spell lasts, you instantly become aware of any
Tiny or larger creature that enters the enclosed area. You
know the creature’s type but nothing else about it. You are
also aware when creatures leave
the area.
This awareness is enough to wake you
from sleep, and you receive the knowledge as long as
you’re on the same plane of existence as your lair.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, add 50 feet to the
maximum dimensions of the cube and add 12 hours to
the spell’s duration for each slot level above 2nd.

You tap into the life force of a creature that is capable of
performing legendary actions. When you cast the spell,
the target must make a successful Constitution saving
throw or lose the ability to take legendary actions for the
spell’s duration. A creature can’t use legendary resistance
to automatically succeed on the saving throw against
this spell. An affected creature can repeat the saving
throw at the end of each of its turns, regaining 1
legendary action on a successful save. The target
continues repeating the saving throw until the

You can take two actions on your turn to attack with your
claws, dealing 1d6 slashing damage on a hit. You have
resistance to to acid and thunder damage. Up to three
times while the spell is active, as an action, you can breathe
a 20-foot cone of metal shards, dealing 6d8 slashing

you a flying speed of 40 feet.

Name: OVERWHELMING GREED
Level: 4
School: Enchantment
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S, M (a gold piece)
Duration: 1 hour
Description:
You fill the target with a dragon’s greed for wealth. The
target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be
overcome with greed, coveting any coins, jewelry, or art
objects it can see that have a value of at least 1 gold piece,
as well as jealously guarding any wealth it already owns.
The target fixates on the most valuable-looking item or
items, or the largest concentration of valuables in sight.
It will not willingly let the wealth out of its sight. If the
target sees an opportunity, it will take the valuables it has
fixated on, gaining them by whatever means necessary.
If doing so provokes a situation where it takes damage
or is otherwise harmed, the affected creature can make
another Wisdom saving throw to end the effect. If the
creature fails the save, it will continue to try to acquire the
wealth, fighting back if necessary.
Ending the Effect. If the affected creature ends its turn in
an area where it cannot see any obviously valuable objects
to covet, nor any creatures that might conceivably attempt
to take its own property (a horse, for example, would
not be considered such a creature), then it can make
another Wisdom saving throw. A successful save ends the
spell, and the creature recognizes its feelings of greed as
magically induced.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell
slot of 5th level or higher, you can affect one additional
creature for each slot level above 4th.

draconic beast. The target of the spell appears to be a
dragon of size Large or smaller. When seeing this illusion,
observers make a Wisdom saving throw to see through it.
You can use an action to make the illusory dragon seem
ferocious. Choose one creature within 30 feet of the
illusory dragon to make a Wisdom saving throw. If it fails,
the creature is frightened. The creature remains frightened
until it uses an action to make a successful Wisdom saving

Description:
You summon death and decay to plague your enemies.
For dragons, this act often takes the form of attacking a
foe’s armor and scales, as a way of weakening an enemy
dragon and leaving it plagued by self-doubt and fear. (This
enchantment is useful against any armored creature, not
just dragons.)
One creature of your choice within range that has natural
armor must make a Constitution saving throw. If it fails,
attacks against that creature’s Armor Class are made
with advantage, and the creature can’t regain hit points
through any means while the spell remains in effect. An
affected creature can end the spell by making a successful
Constitution saving throw, which also makes the creature
immune to further castings of scale rot for 24 hours.

You cause the glint of a golden coin to haze over the vision
of one creature in range. The target creature must make
a Wisdom saving throw. If it fails, it sees a gorge, trench,
or other hole in the ground, at a spot within range chosen
by you, which is filled with gold and treasure. On its next
turn, the creature must move toward that spot. When it
reaches the spot, it becomes incapacitated, as it devotes
all its attention to scooping imaginary treasure into its
pockets or a pouch.
An affected creature can repeat the saving throw at the
end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a
success. The effect also ends if the creature takes damage
from you or one of your allies.
Creatures with the dragon type have disadvantage on the
initial saving throw but have advantage on saving throws
against this spell made after reaching the designated spot.

Name: WAFT
Level: 1
School: Transmutation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self
Components: V, S, M (a topaz worth at least 10 gp)
Duration: 1 round
Description:
This spell was first invented by dragon parents to assist
their offspring when learning to fly. You gain a flying
speed of 60 feet for 1 round. At the start of your next turn,
you float rapidly down and land gently on a solid surface
beneath you.
Wizards practice the subtle magic of pulling power from
thin air and shaping it to fit their needs. Sorcerers tame
the chaotic power within themselves, releasing it in barely
controlled gouts of magical eruptions. Wizards who
walk the path between these two diverse means of using
magic are called dragon mages, and they meld the order
of wizardry with the chaos of elemental mastery to grant
themselves special powers.
Dragon mages manifest their magic in a variety of styles,
as diverse as the kinds of dragons and the types of magic
that populate the worlds. Kobolds serving as councilors to
great wyrms are taught by their masters to harness their
innate draconic nature through the use of more traditional
spells. A wild-eyed human, oozing sorcerous magic thanks
to an ancient draconic ancestor, might find a kindly wizard
to help her focus her power. Special legions of dragonborn
troops train with a master dragon mage, learning to better
defend their homeland from invaders.
How to Start: If you’re a wizard who wants to become
a dragon mage, you make that decision upon reaching
2nd level, when you are also entitled to choose an arcane
tradition. If you decide to follow the path of the dragon
mage exclusively, you can forego the selection of an
arcane tradition and gain the features of the dragon mage
specialty instead.
You can also pursue the dragon mage specialty in
conjunction with one of the standard arcane traditions.
If you choose to do this, you gain the Savant feature of
your chosen school in addition to Dragon Magic Savant
(described below). Also at 2nd level, you choose whether
to gain Invoke Dragon Mask (see below) or the 2nd-level
feature of your chosen school. Thereafter, at 6th, 10th, and
14th level, you choose between the lowest-level features
still available. For instance, an enchanter might select
Hypnotic Gaze at 2nd level and Invoke Dragon Mask at
6th level, followed by either Instinctive Charm or Invoke
Dragon Heart at 10th level.
Beginning when you take up this specialty at 2nd level, the
gold and time you must spend to copy a dragon magic spell
into your spellbook is halved.
Starting at 2nd level, you can invoke a magic dragon mask.
You use a bonus action and expend a spell slot to invoke
the mask, which lasts for 3 rounds for each level of the
expended spell slot. The dragon mask remains as long as
you are not incapacitated, until you use a bonus action to
dismiss or replace it, or until the duration expires. The mask
is a translucent magical force, in the form of a dragon’s
head, which covers your face. Your face is still visible
through the mask, and the mask does not hinder vision.
While you wear your dragon mask, you receive the
following benefits and drawbacks:
• You have a bonus to your AC equal to your Intelligence
modifier (minimum of +1).
• You gain a bite attack. As an action, make a melee spell
attack against one adjacent target. On a hit, the target
takes piercing damage equal to 1d8 + your Intelligence
modifier. This attack counts as magical for the purpose
of overcoming a target’s immunity or resistance to
piecing damage.
• You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks
and Charisma (Intimidation) checks.
• Attack rolls for any ranged or melee attack spells
you cast while wearing the mask are made with
disadvantage, and saving throws against spells you cast
while wearing the mask are made with advantage.
• As a bonus action, you can expend an additional spell
slot to augment the damage of your next dragon mask
bite attack. The damage increases by 1d8 for each level
of the expended spell slot, and you have advantage on
the attack roll.
Starting at 6th level, you can invoke a magic dragon heart.
You use a bonus action and expend a spell slot to invoke
the heart, which lasts for 3 rounds for each level of the
expended spell slot. The dragon heart remains as long as
you are not incapacitated, until you use a bonus action
to dismiss or replace it, or until the duration expires.
The heart is a translucent magical force, in the form of a
beating heart, which covers your chest. Your body is still
visible through the heart.
While you wear your dragon heart, you receive the
following benefits:
• You have a bonus to Wisdom and Charisma saving
throws equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum
of +1).
• You gain temporary hit points equal to twice your
wizard level. These temporary hit points are lost when
your heart is no longer active.
• You gain a breath weapon attack. You can use an action
to shoot a 30-foot-long, 5-foot-wide line of energy
(dealing your choice of acid, cold, fire, or lightning
damage) from your dragon heart in a direction
you choose. Each creature in the line must make a
successful Dexterity saving throw or take 4d6 damage
of the chosen type. The damage type cannot be changed
while your current dragon heart is active.
• As a bonus action, you can expend an additional spell
slot to augment the damage of your next dragon heart
breath weapon attack. The damage increases by 2d6
for each level of the expended spell slot, and you can
add 10 feet of length to the line for each level of the
expended spell slot.
Starting at 10th level, you can invoke a set of magical
dragon wings. You use a bonus action and spend a spell
slot to invoke the dragon wings, which last for 2 rounds
per level of the spent spell slot. The dragon wings remain
as long as you are not incapacitated, until the duration
ends, or until they are dismissed or replaced by using a
bonus action.
While you wear your dragon wings, you receive the
following benefits:
• Your speed increases by 10 feet, and you gain a flying
speed equal to your walking speed.
• You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and
slashing damage from nonmagical attacks.
• You have advantage on any melee or ranged spell
attack rolls.
• As a bonus action, you can spend an additional
spell slot to augment your wings. Until the start
of your next turn, you can add 5 feet of additional
speed for each level of the expended spell slot spent.
Additionally, you can choose one creature within 10
feet of you for each level of the expended spell slot,
and ranged attacks against those creatures are made
with disadvantage.
Starting at 14th level, you can invoke a magic dragon tail.
You use a bonus action and expend a spell slot to invoke
the tail, which lasts for 1 round per level of the
spent spell slot. The dragon tail remains as
long as you are not incapacitated, until you
use a bonus action to dismiss or replace it,
or until the duration expires.The dragon
tail is a translucent magical force, in the
form of a 15-foot-long appendage capable of
striking with great impact.
While you wear your dragon tail, you
receive the following benefits.
• You are immune to the grappled
condition.
• You are have proficiency with
Strength and Dexterity
saving throws and any ability
checks using Strength.
In addition, you can use
your Intelligence modifier
instead of the normal
modifier for those saving
throws and checks.
• You gain a tail slam attack. As an action, you make a
separate melee spell attack against each target within
15 feet of you. On a hit, the target takes bludgeoning
damage equal to 3d10 + your Intelligence modifier.
A creature hit by this attack is pushed up to 10 feet
away from you and knocked prone unless it succeeds
on a Strength saving throw against your spell save
DC. This attack counts as magical for the purpose
of overcoming a target’s immunity or resistance to
bludgeoning damage.
• As a reaction, you can make a tail slam attack against a
creature that moves to within 15 feet of your tail.
• As a bonus action, you can spend an additional spell
slot to augment your dragon tail. Until the start of
your next turn, your dragon tail’s slam attack damage
increases by 1d10 per level of the spell slot spent. In
addition, you heal yourself for 3 hit points per level of
the spell slot spent.
When the elves first developed their magic long ago, the
spells they learned to use were all cast as rituals. Over
time, researchers who came later discovered how to cast
most spells more quickly and with greater potency—at the
expense of sapping their energy and leaving them in need
of recuperation.
Some of the original elven rituals are still being taught
and used today—and just as in the distant past, they can
be cast only as rituals. That aspect of their nature sets them
apart from all other spells, because it means that anyone
who can cast one of these spells can do so repeatedly,
without needing to draw on enough of their inner power
to deplete their magical ability.
Ritual Focus. Another quality unique to elven ritual
magic is the ability of the caster to call upon inner reserves
and expend extra effort to improve or enhance the effect
Elven Ritual Magic
RITUAL CASTER OR NOT?
Elven ritual magic can be incorporated into the game in
one of two ways, depending mainly on whether the GM
uses the rules for feats. If so, then it might be necessary
for a character to have the Ritual Caster feat before any
of these spells can be employed. If not, then—unless the
GM decides otherwise—a character can cast any of these
spells as normal, provided that they appear on his or her
spell list.
of an elven ritual spell. This extra effort is represented by
the caster’s ritual focus. Each of the  ends
with a paragraph that explains the effect of expending the
ritual focus on the casting of that spell.
Unlike a normal spellcasting focus, a ritual focus is not
an object; it’s a state of mind. And once this mental energy
has been expended, a caster’s ritual focus can’t be used
again until he or she finishes a short or long rest.
Most elven ritual spells are usable by more than one class.
All of them, not surprisingly, are wizard spells, but a
relative few can also be cast by sorcerers or warlocks.

Duration: Permanent; one generation
Description:
likeness of the victim worth 1,250 gp)
You invoke the darkest curses upon your
victim and his or her descendants. This
spell does not require that you have a clear
path to your target, only that your target
is within range. The target must make a
successful Wisdom saving throw or be cursed
until the magic is dispelled. While cursed,
the victim has disadvantage on ability checks
and saving throws made with the ability score
that you used when you cast the spell. In addition, the
target’s firstborn offspring is also targeted by the curse.
That individual is allowed a saving throw of its own if it
is currently alive, or it makes one upon its birth if it is not
yet born when the spell is cast. If the target’s firstborn has
already died, the curse passes to the target’s next oldest
offspring.
Ritual Focus. If you expend your ritual focus, the curse
becomes hereditary, passing from firstborn to firstborn
for the entire length of the family’s lineage until one of
them successfully saves against the curse and throws off

You plant a silver acorn in solid ground and spend an
hour chanting a litany of praises to the natural world,
after which the land within 1 mile of the acorn becomes
extremely fertile, regardless of its previous state. Any
seeds planted in the area grow at twice the natural rate.
Food harvested regrows within a week. After one year, the
land slowly reverts to its normal fertility, unable to stave
off the march of nature.
Choose one of the following effects, which appears and
grows immediately:
• A field planted with vegetables of your choice, ready for
harvest.
• A thick forest of stout trees and ample undergrowth.
• A grassland with wildflowers and fodder for grazing.
• An orchard of fruit trees of your choice, growing in
orderly rows and ready for harvest.
Living creatures that take a short rest within the area of a

Name: CELEBRATION
Level: 7
School: Enchantment
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 90 feet
Components: V, S, M (a small party favor)
Duration: 1 hour
Description:
You create a 30-foot-radius area around a point that you
choose within range. An intelligent creature that enters
the area or starts its turn there must make a Wisdom
saving throw. On a failed save, the creature starts to engage
in celebratory revelry: drinking, singing, laughing, and
dancing. Affected creatures are reluctant to leave the area
until the spell ends, preferring to continue the festivities.
They forsake appointments, cease caring about their
woes, and generally behave in a cordial (if not hedonistic)
manner. This preoccupation with merrymaking occurs
regardless of an affected creature’s agenda or alignment.
Assassins procrastinate, servants join in the celebration
rather than working, and guards abandon their posts.
The effect ends on a creature when it is attacked, takes
damage, or is forced to leave the area. A creature that
makes a successful saving throw can enter or leave the area
without danger of being enchanted. A creature that fails
the saving throw and is forcibly removed from the area
must repeat the saving throw if it returns to the area.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 8th level or higher, the spell lasts for an
additional hour for each slot level above 7th.
Ritual Focus. If you expend your ritual focus, an
unaffected intelligent creature must make a new saving
throw every time it starts its turn in the area, even if it has
previously succeeded on a save against the spell.

Description:
With a harsh word and a vicious chopping motion, you
cause every tree, shrub, and stump within 40 feet of you to
sink into the ground, leaving the vacated area clear of plant
life that might otherwise hamper movement or obscure
sight. Overgrown areas that counted as difficult terrain
become clear ground and no longer hamper movement.
The original plant life instantly rises from the ground
again when the spell ends or is dispelled. Plant creatures
are not affected by clearing the field.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the spell lasts for an

You plant an obsidian acorn in solid ground and spend
an hour chanting a litany of curses to the natural world,
after which the land within 1 mile of the acorn becomes
infertile, regardless of its previous state. Nothing will
grow there, and all plant life in the area dies over the
course of a day. Plant creatures are not affected. Spells that
summon plants, such as entangle, require an ability check
using the caster’s spellcasting ability against your spell save
DC. On a successful check, the spell functions normally; if
the check fails, the spell is countered by desolation.
After one year, the land slowly reverts to its normal
fertility, unable to stave off the march of nature.
A living creature that finishes a short rest within the
area of a desolation spell halves the result of any Hit Dice it
expends. Desolation counters the effects of a bloom spell.

silver rod worth 100 gp)
You cause menacing shadows to invade an area 200 feet on
a side and 50 feet high, centered on a point within range.
Illumination in the area drops one step (from bright light
to dim, or from dim light to darkness). Any spell that
creates light in the area that is cast using a lower-level spell
slot than was used to cast encroaching shadows is dispelled,
and a spell that creates light doesn’t function in the area
if that spell is cast using a spell slot of 5th level or lower.
Nonmagical effects can’t increase the level of illumination
in the affected area.
A spell that creates darkness or shadow takes effect in the
area as if the spell slot expended was one level higher than
the spell slot actually used.

a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the effect lasts for an
additional 12 hours for each slot level above 6th.
Ritual Focus. If you expend your ritual focus, the spell’s
duration increases by 12 hours, and it cannot be dispelled
by a spell that creates light, even if that spell is cast using a
higher-level spell slot.

Name: EXTRACT ESSENCE
Level: 1
School: Transmutation
Casting Time: 10 minutes
Range: 30 feet
Components: V, S, M (a wooden bowl)
Duration: Permanent
Description:
You extract the goodness from food, pulling all the
nutritional value out of three days’ worth of meals and
concentrating it into a tablespoon of bland, flourlike
powder. The flour can be mixed with liquid and drunk or
baked into bread. When consumed, it still imparts all the
nutritional value of the original food.
The original food appears unchanged, and though it’s
still filling, it has no nutritional value.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
spell slot of 2nd level or higher, an additional three meals’
worth of food can be extracted for each slot level above 1st.
Ritual Focus. If you expend your ritual focus, you can
choose to have each day’s worth of meals take the form of a
single slice of bread.

Casting Time: 10 minutes
Range: Touch
Components: V, M (a signet ring worth 25 gp)
Duration: 10 minutes
Description:
You whisper words of encouragement, and a creature
that you touch gains confidence along with approval from
strangers. For the spell’s duration, the target puts its best
foot forward and strangers associate the creature with
positive feelings. The target adds 1d4 to all Charisma
(Persuasion) checks made to influence the attitudes of
others.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the effect lasts for an

Name: SHADOWS BROUGHT TO LIGHT
Level: 2
School: Divination
Casting Time: 10 minutes
Range: 30 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous
Description:
If a creature you designate within range fails a Charisma
saving throw, you cause the target’s shadow to come to life
and reveal one of the creature’s most scandalous secrets:
some fact that the target would not want widely known
(GM’s choice). When casting the spell, you choose whether
everyone present will hear the secret, in which case the
shadow speaks loudly in a twisted version of the target’s
voice, or if the secret is whispered only to you. The shadow
speaks in the target’s native language.
If the target does not have a scandalous secret or does not
have a spoken language, the spell fails as if the creature’s
saving throw had succeeded.
If the secret was spoken aloud, the target takes a −2
penalty to Charisma checks involving anyone who was
present when it was revealed. This penalty lasts until you
finish a long rest.
Ritual Focus. If you expend your ritual focus, the target
has disadvantage on Charisma checks instead of taking the
−2 penalty.

You fill a small silver cup with your own blood (taking 1d4
piercing damage) while chanting vile curses in the dark.
Once the chant is completed, you consume the blood and
swear an oath of vengeance against any who harm you.
If you are reduced to 0 hit points, your oath is invoked;
a shadow materializes within 5 feet of you. The shadow
attacks the creature that reduced you to 0 hit points,
ignoring all other targets, until it or the target is slain, at
which point the shadow dissipates into nothing.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
spell slot of 5th level or higher, an additional shadow is
conjured for each slot level above 4th.
Ritual Focus. If you expend your ritual focus, the spell
summons a banshee instead of a shadow. If you also use a
higher-level spell slot, additional undead are still shadows.

You attune your senses to the natural world, so that
you detect every sound that occurs within 60 feet: wind
blowing through branches, falling leaves, grazing deer,
trickling streams, and more. You can clearly picture the
source of each sound in your mind. The spell gives you
tremorsense out to a range of 10 feet. In addition, you
have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely
on hearing. Creatures that make no noise or that are
magically silent cannot be detected by this spell’s effect.
Song of the forest functions only in natural environments;
it fails if cast underground, in a city, or in a building that
isolates the caster from nature (GM’s discretion).
Ritual Focus. If you expend your ritual focus, the spell
also gives you blindsight out to a range of 30 feet.

School: Conjuration
Casting Time: 10 minutes

Duration: 1 hour
Description:
consumed in the casting)
You cause a vine to sprout from the ground and crawl
across a surface or rise into the air in a direction chosen
by you. The vine must sprout from a solid surface (such as
the ground or a wall), and it is strong enough to support
600 pounds of weight along its entire length. The vine
collapses immediately if that 600-pound limit is exceeded.
A vine that collapses from weight or damage instantly
disintegrates.
The vine has many small shoots, so it can be climbed with
a successful DC 5 Strength (Athletics) check. It has AC 8,
hit points equal to 5 × your spellcasting level, and a damage
threshold of 5.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the vine can support an
additional 30 pounds, and its damage threshold increases
by 1 for each slot level above 2nd.
Ritual Focus. If you expend your ritual focus, the vine is
permanent until destroyed or dispelled.
For countless ages the heat of the deserts and shifting
sands of these lands have held many secrets that fascinate,
delight, and terrify. Ancient knowledge can be found here
by those who know how and where to look, unlocking
a new world of power and possibility. But beware—this
knowledge is difficult to learn and dangerous to the
unschooled! Few of its masters are willing to teach their
secrets to anyone outside their own sect. But perhaps as
an astute linguist, a talented artist, or even a clever mason,
you can tap into the secret script of magic from ancient
times and unlock the power of hieroglyphs.
Accessing the magic of hieroglyphs requires the Script
Carver and Script Sage feats. If the option to gain feats
isn’t used in your campaign, then Script Carver and
Script Sage can be gained in place of level-based ability
score improvement, if your GM approves. Alternatively,
characters might need to accomplish other, story-related
tasks determined by the GM to gain the abilities bestowed
by the Script Carver and Script Sage feats. Once any
obstacles are cleared, all characters who meet the
prerequisites can gain these feats.
Prerequisite: Intelligence 12 or higher
You have learned how to expertly scribe two hieroglyphs
of your choice, and you gain the benefit associated with
each one. In addition, you can invoke one power of each
hieroglyph you have learned, provided you meet any other
requirements, such as a minimum level.
You can select this feat multiple times. Each time you
do, you gain the benefit and powers of two additional
hieroglyphs of your choice.
Hieroglyph Magic
Prerequisite: Script Carver
Through dedicated study, you have mastered one
hieroglyph of your choice. Choose one hieroglyph that
you have already learned through Script Carver. You can
invoke one of its mastery powers, provided you meet any
other requirements, such as a minimum level.
You can select this feat multiple times. Each time you
do, you learn the mastery powers of a different hieroglyph
from your repertoire.
Invoking one of a hieroglyph’s powers requires an action
and provokes opportunity attacks. Generally, you must
either draw a physical representation of the glyph (in
paint, in blood, in the dirt or snow, and so forth) or trace
the shape of an existing carving of the glyph that was
created to an exacting standard.
Each hieroglyph confers a benefit on someone who
knows how to scribe it. A hieroglyph’s benefit is always
in effect for a character who knows that hieroglyph.
In addition, that character can call upon one of the
hieroglyph’s powers when so desired. Unless otherwise
noted, all hieroglyph powers can be used once, and that
expended use is regained when you finish a long rest.
Some powers have a level requirement (given in
parentheses); when a character attains that level, this
power becomes an additional choice. Mastery powers are a
separate category: only a character who has the Script Sage
feat for a particular hieroglyph can use its mastery power.
If a power or a mastery power has no level requirement,
it becomes available to you as soon as you acquire the
necessary feat.
If a hieroglyph power gives you the ability to cast a spell,
you can do so without needing any components (aside
from materials needed for the drawing of the glyph), and
the spell is always cast as if using the lowest-level spell slot
possible. It typically has the same duration as a normal
casting of the spell, and uses your character level as the
caster level.
When a hieroglyph power calls for a saving throw, the
DC equals 8 + your ability bonus + your proficiency bonus.
The ability that applies to the DC calculation is the same as
the ability used for the saving throw.
Hieroglyph
DescriptionsThe hieroglyphs are presented below in alphabetical order.
AS DOES EVERY GOD, EVERY BIRD, EVERY FISH,
This symbol represents the fertility and abundance of
animal life and every being’s place in the chain of life.
Benefit: You gain advantage on ability checks or skill
checks to identify creatures.
Power: You can use an action to quickly trace this glyph
in the air and stare down a beast or a monstrosity. The
targeted creature must make a Wisdom saving throw. On
a failed save, the creature is frightened of you for as long
as you continue staring at it. While frightened in this way,
the creature must move at its full speed away from you on
each of its turns until you can’t see it or until it makes a
successful saving throw. An affected creature repeats the
saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the
effect on itself with a successful save. When a creature’s
saving throw is successful (regardless of whether it failed
previously), it has disadvantage on attack rolls against you
until the end of its next turn.
Mastery Power: If you spend 1 minute tracing this glyph
on the body of an animal, you can grant yourself a measure
of the animal’s ability. You gain one of the following: a
climbing or swimming speed of 30 feet, or a flying or
burrowing speed of 20 feet—whichever is most appropriate
to the type of animal the bone came from. The effect lasts
for as long as you maintain concentration, up to 1 hour.
This symbol represents sweet scents, perfumes, allure, and
pleasant feelings. It can also be associated with influencing
or changing the mind of another.
Benefit: You gain a +1 bonus on Charisma (Persuasion)
checks.
Power: If you use an action to trace this glyph on your
body in cologne or perfume, you have advantage on
Charisma checks for the next hour.
Power (3rd Level): If you use an action to trace this
hieroglyph on the ground with dust or ink made from the
petals of flowers, every creature within 10 feet of you must
make a successful Charisma saving throw or be charmed
by you for 1 minute.
Power (5th Level): You use an action to contemplate
flower petals as they drift in the breeze, enabling you to
cast a gust of wind spell.
Mastery Power: When you use an action to anoint
yourself with perfume, for the next 10 minutes you have
advantage on Charisma checks to influence people within
50 feet of you.
DRINK DEEP OF THE RIVER’S POWER
This hieroglyph represents the flow of magic through the
land, as well as the physical flow of rivers.
Benefit: You gain the ability to cast one cantrip of your
choice from the wizard spell list. Your spellcasting ability is
Intelligence when you cast this cantrip.
Power (2nd Level): You trace this hieroglyph over
a creature’s eyes in a ritual that takes 10 minutes to
perform. When the ritual is complete, it produces a detect
magic effect that works on the creature and on any items
the creature is holding or carrying. The effect lasts for 1
minute while you maintain concentration.
Mastery Power: You trace this hieroglyph in dirt over
the course of 1 hour. At the end of the hour, you dispel a
magical effect of up to 4th level that is within 120 feet of
you. If the effect is higher than 4th level, you dispel it if
you make a successful Intelligence (Arcana) check against
a DC equal to 10 + the level of the effect.
This symbol represents the transition from the realm of
the living to the realm of the dead. It is often engraved on
the tombs of fallen heroes.
Benefit: You gain a +1 bonus on Constitution saving
throws.
Power: When you drop to 0 hit points, you become
stabilized immediately and automatically.
Mastery Power: You can see a distance of 60 feet into
the Ethereal Plane for 1 hour. You also can determine
whether anyone within 60 feet of you is possessed by a
spirit; you see such a figure as having a vague, dim outline
around it.
FLY AS THE FALCON, HOWL AS THE WOLF
This symbol represents hunting, tracking, stalking, and
bringing prey to the ground.
Benefit: You gain a +1 bonus on Wisdom (Survival) checks.
Power (2nd Level): When you use an action to trace
this symbol on the body of a willing creature, the creature
gains darkvision out to a range of 20 feet, which lasts for 1
minute and works even in magical darkness.
Power (4th Level): You trace this hieroglyph on an
item that belongs to a specific creature or clearly represents
a creature you have encountered, then use an action to
consume it. For the next hour, the tracks of that creature
glow in your sight. You can follow and track the creature
automatically while moving at the speed of a forced march.
Mastery Power: By using an action to trace this glyph
on your hand, you invoke the hunter’s gift against a specific
creature. The target must be a creature you have previously
used one of this hieroglyph’s powers against. The next
time you hit the creature with an attack, it must make a
successful Constitution saving throw or take an additional
1d10 necrotic damage from the attack.
This symbol represents gifts, knowledge, secrets, and
things hidden.
Benefit: You gain a +1 bonus on Intelligence
(Investigation) checks.
Power: By spending 1 minute in concentration while
holding a papyrus reed, you can cast the spell speak with
inanimate object (see ).
Power (4th Level): By taking an action to break open
an egg, you create an extradimensional space (a “silver
coffer”) that is 5 cubic feet in volume and can hold up to 50
pounds of material. This space looks like a simple, empty
hole in the ground, but when you reach inside it, you always
find whatever you placed inside. The extradimensional
space remains visible as a hole in the ground for 24
hours, then disappears, along with its contents. It can be
reopened with another use of this hieroglyph power. The
silver coffer’s location on the Material Plane depends on
your location when you trigger the hieroglyph. This power
always opens the same extradimensional space no matter
how much time passes or how far you travel between uses,
so it’s not a good way to dispose of, for example, unwanted
or dangerous magic items. If the person who created the
extradimensional space dies, any items in the silver coffer
eventually reappear on their plane of origin at a random
location, anytime from a day to several centuries after the
creator’s death.
Mastery Power (10th Level): By taking an action to rub a
special brown paste over your eyes that costs 50 gp, you can
cast true seeing on yourself.
This symbol represents charity, healing, benevolent
leadership, and sanctuary given to friends and kin as well
as enemies.
Benefit: You have advantage on Wisdom (Medicine)
checks.
Power: If you spend an hour in meditation while holding
a mug of beer or a goblet of wine, your sincere wish to help
someone transfers into the brew. When a creature drinks
the brew, it gains all the benefits of finishing a short rest.
This brew remains potent for 24 hours.
Mastery Power: If you spend an hour in meditation
while holding a full waterskin, up to six creatures that
drink from the waterskin recover from two levels of
exhaustion and don’t need any food or water until after
finishing a long rest. The water remains potent for up to 24
hours, or until six creatures have drunk it.
THE GODS’ COMPANY IS LIKE LIGHT
This symbol represents knowledge gained over an
extended time through dedication and effort.
Benefit: You gain the ability to speak and read one
additional language of your choice.
Power: After meditating on this hieroglyph for 10
minutes, you can cast comprehend languages.
Power (2nd Level): If you take an action to trace this
symbol on your forehead or that of another creature, the
recipient gains advantage on Intelligence checks for 1
minute.
Mastery Power: By inhaling incense and powders over
the course of an hour, you call upon your ancestors to
reveal a bit of knowledge from the past. This knowledge
enables you to gain your ancestors’ assistance with a
problem immediately before you. The implementation of
this benefit is up to the GM; you might receive a specific
clue that helps you to solve the problem, or you might
gain proficiency for 1 hour with a skill or a set of tools,
or advantage on a single type of skill check for the same
length of time.
This symbol represents the judgment of the dead,
ever watchful and weighing the actions of the living in
expectation of the moment when they eventually pass on
from the world.
Benefit: You gain a +1 bonus on Intelligence
(Investigation) checks.
Power: You trace this hieroglyph in ash on the body of
a willing creature, which requires an action. For the next
hour, the creature has advantage on Wisdom ability checks.
Power (3rd Level): If you use an action to trace this
hieroglyph in the air with your fingers, you force a creature
you can see to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed
save, you can immediately give the creature one command,
either verbally or in writing, that can be completed in the
next minute. The creature must try to obey the command
to the best of its ability, provided that doing so won’t
directly harm it. If the task isn’t completed within 1
minute, the glyph’s power wears off and the creature is
freed from the compulsion.
Mastery Power (9th Level): You spend 10 minutes
decorating a piece of paper with this hieroglyph. If you
then take an action to burn the paper, you can cast a geas
spell on one target. As with a normal casting of the spell,
you and the target must have a language in common for
the effect to work.
This symbol represents the prevention of harm, usually
through the protection of devoted soldiers or bodyguards.
Benefit: When you wear no armor, your Armor Class
is equal to 10 + your Wisdom modifier + your Dexterity
modifier.
Power (3rd Level): If you take an action to trace
this hieroglyph on a creature, you grant that creature
resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage
(your choice) for 1 minute.
Power (5th Level): By taking an action to burn a bit
of incense, you can conjure a squad of soldiers. These
soldiers can appear different to different creatures; some
might see a squad of orcs, others a group of the king's
guards. The soldiers appear standing inside a 10-foot-
square space within 10 feet of you, and they can’t leave
that space. Within that space, they behave like a swarm;
other creatures can enter the space and end their turn
there. Whenever one of your enemies enters the soldiers’
space or starts its turn in the space or within 5 feet of it, the
soldiers attack that creature. Their attack bonus is equal
to your Wisdom modifier + your proficiency modifier, and
a successful attack deals 2d6 force damage. The soldiers
remain for 1 minute, provided you maintain concentration
on them. They are immune to all forms of damage and can’t
be dispelled except by breaking your concentration.
Mastery Power (8th Level): If you take an action to trace
this hieroglyph on the ground and then throw a handful of
sand into the air, you can cast banishment.
This symbol represents the power of storms and wind and
the effect these phenomena can have on the world.
Benefit: You can resist any effect or attack that would
move you, causing you to be moved 5 feet less than the
effect’s normal distance.
Power (3rd Level): By drawing this hieroglyph in the
air for three consecutive turns (each one requiring an
action), you gain the ability to cast wind wall.
Power (5th Level): After spending an hour in
meditation with burning incense before tracing this
hieroglyph in the air, you can cast a modified version of
control weather. Unlike the spell, this power affects an area
only a quarter-mile in radius, and the change lasts no
longer than 20 minutes.
Mastery Power: Immediately after performing a
10-minute ritual with special incense, you can cast a
modified version of wind walk. Unlike the spell, this power
affects up to five creatures, and the effect lasts for up to 2
hours and requires your concentration.
This symbol represents travel, persistence, and not giving
up in the face of challenge.
Benefit: You gain a +1 bonus on saving throws to resist
exhaustion.
Power (3rd Level): If you take an action to trace this
symbol on the body of a willing creature, you increase that
creature’s speed by 15 feet for 1 hour. This power affects all
forms of movement the creature can use.
Mastery Power: By drawing this hieroglyph on the
ground over the course of 10 minutes, you create a
temporary portal to another place within 1 mile that you’re
familiar with. You can step through the portal once, after
which it disappears. You can bring along a number of
other creatures equal to one-fourth your level (round up),
provided all of them are your size or smaller and either
willing or helpless.
This symbol represents triumph over your enemies,
victory, and celebration of those victories.
Benefit: You gain a +1 bonus on Charisma
(Intimidation) checks.
Power (3rd Level): To trigger this power, you must use
an action to trace the symbol on yourself with a knife or
other sharp object (pressing hard enough to leave a mark
on the skin but not hard enough to draw blood) and emit
a loud battle cry. Each creature you designate within 10
feet of you that hears the battle cry must make a successful
Charisma saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute.
Mastery Power: Once a week, you can host a feast for
your companions and other allies. Each individual who
partakes in the feast gains temporary hit points equal
to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 2) and has
advantage on the same number of its next attack rolls.
The effect dissipates for each creature after 24 hours if the
benefits have not been used by then.
This symbol represents casting off chains, putting down
oppression, and opening pathways.
Benefit: You gain a +1 bonus on Dexterity (Sleight of
Hand) checks.
Power: If you use an action to trace this hieroglyph on
a rope, chain, or other implement that’s holding you in
place, you gain advantage on Dexterity checks made to
free yourself. This benefit doesn’t apply to checks made
to escape a grapple, unless you’re being grappled by an
inanimate object.
Mastery Power: When you take an action to trace
this hieroglyph on the body of a willing creature, you can
impart to that creature the effect of a blink spell.
This symbol represents robust and vigorous health and the
favor of the gods.

Hit Die you have.
Power: When you take an action to trace this hieroglyph
on a creature’s skin with blood, that creature gains a
number of temporary hit points equal to your Hit Dice.
Mastery Power: If you spend 1 minute repeatedly
tracing this hieroglyph on the body of an afflicted creature,
you can cast lesser restoration on that creature.
This symbol represents physical and mental strength,
overcoming weakness, and surpassing limits.
Benefit: You count as one size larger for the purpose of
determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can
push, drag, or lift.
Power: By using an action to trace this hieroglyph on a
creature, you double that creature’s Strength bonus for
the purpose of determining the damage from its next
successful attack.
Power (3rd Level): If you take an action to crush a
previously prepared clay semblance of this hieroglyph, you
gain advantage on Strength checks for 1 minute. You can
also give the clay hieroglyph to another creature, so that
creature can gain the benefit from crushing it.
Mastery Power: If you use an action to trace this
hieroglyph on a creature, it is freed from the need for sleep
and immune to the effects of exhaustion for 24 hours.
This symbol represents moral rightness, dominance,
rulership, and ego.
Benefit: You have advantage on Charisma saving throws.
Power (3rd Level): By tracing this hieroglyph on your
clothing, you rally your allies and improve their morale.
For the next minute, each of your allies gains a +1 bonus
on attack rolls, saving throws against fear effects, and skill
checks while within 10 feet of you.
Mastery Power: If you use an action to trace this
hieroglyph on a willing creature, it gains the ability to
overawe the mind of one other creature within 60 feet. The
targeted creature must make a successful Charisma saving
throw or prostrate itself before the creature that bears the
hieroglyph. An awed creature repeats the saving throw at
the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself with
a success. The effect lasts for 1 minute or until the awed
creature is attacked.
This symbol represents vision, sight, and perceiving from
great distances.
Benefit: You gain a +1 bonus on Wisdom (Perception)
checks.
Power: If you use an action to trace this glyph on a
creature, you can cast enhance ability on the target, which
gains the benefit of the Owl’s Wisdom effect.
Mastery Power: By tracing this glyph over and over in a
10-minute ritual, you can cast clairvoyance.
This symbol represents looking beneath the surface to see
the world differently or to question the way things are done.
Benefit: You gain a +1 bonus on Wisdom (Insight) checks.
Power (3rd Level): By spending 5 minutes tracing the
hieroglyph on a creature, you imbue that creature with
the ability to cast detect evil and good once in the next 24
hours. The hieroglyph can also be created on a small object
instead of directly on a creature; in that case, detect evil and
good can be cast once by a creature holding the object.
Power (6th Level): After spending 10 minutes inking
this hieroglyph in the middle of your forehead, you gain
the benefits of casting detect thoughts for as long as you
concentrate, up to 1 minute.
Mastery Power: By taking an action to draw this
hieroglyph, you can cast arcane eye.
WITH ONE HEART AND VOICE,
This symbol represents unity, community, common
purpose and goals, and protecting one another.
Benefit: You have advantage on any saving throw that is
also being made by at least one of your allies.
Power (3rd Level): By using an action to draw this
hieroglyph on a rope that you use to bind your wrist to
another creature, you can absorb the damage and other
effects from the next attack that hits the other creature.
The attack must hit the other creature, but it affects you
instead; the other creature is unaffected. The rope can be
no more than 30 feet long.
Mastery Power: By invoking this hieroglyph during
a 10-minute ritual, you can grant telepathy to up to ten
creatures that are within 60 feet of you. The telepathy lasts
for 1 hour, and it works only among the affected creatures
(including you); it can’t be used to communicate with
creatures outside the group.
This symbol is associated with strength, speed, honor, and
heroism.
Benefit: You gain a +1 bonus on initiative rolls.
Power (4th Level): As an action, you can trace this
hieroglyph on a creature to grant it advantage on Strength
checks and Constitution checks for as long as you
maintain concentration, up to 1 hour.
Power (6th Level): By spending 1 round in
concentration to summon power from the sky, you can
target one creature that has this hieroglyph emblazoned
on its forehead. The creature gains the effects of the enlarge
spell, and its head takes on the appearance of a hawk for
the duration of the effect.
Mastery Power (8th Level): When you use an action
to trace this symbol in the air, you grant the speed of the air
to an ally within 60 feet. The affected ally gains the effect of
a haste spell for 1 minute.
Illumination magic concerns both the manipulation of
light and observations of the heavens. Its practitioners
have been likened to elemental specialists who have
an affinity for light instead of fire, earth, air, or water.
Naturally, these individuals are anathema to creatures
and spellcasters that lurk in places where darkness and
shadow hold sway.
Mastery of illumination magic comes from long and
dedicated study, and thus wizards have access to more of
these spells than other spellcasting classes do.

Sharp‑eyed readers will note that some of the spells
described in the standard rules are given out to classes
that were not originally included in those classes' spell lists.
Granting access to those spells to a wider range of classes
is a deliberate change, meant to showcase the expanded
power and utility of illumination magic. If the GM decides
that this approach is too generous, some or all of these
adjustments might be disallowed.

The following spells are presented in alphabetical order.

=== SPELL START ===
Name: AMPLIFY LIGHT
Level: 1
School: Transmutation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M (a nonmagical light source)
Duration: Special
Description:
You touch a nonmagical light source and increase its
brightness. While the spell is in effect, the radius of the
bright light around the source is doubled, and dim light
extends for the same distance beyond that area. The
light source’s duration is halved, however, so that a torch
affected by amplify light would burn out in half an hour, or
a hooded lantern would burn through its fuel in 3 hours.
Adding new fuel to a light source while it is under the
effect of amplify light will end the spell and return it to its
normal brightness.

Name: BURNING RADIANCE
Level: 6
School: Evocation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self (60-foot line)
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous
Description:
A line of light 60 feet long and 5 feet wide emanates from
you in a direction of your choice. Each creature in the line
must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a
creature takes 10d8 radiant damage and catches fire; until
someone takes an action to douse the fire, the creature
takes 1d10 fire damage at the start of each of its turns. A
successful saving throw halves the damage and prevents a
creature from catching fire.
The burning radiance ignites flammable objects in the
area that aren’t being worn or carried.

You wrap yourself in a powerful corona that sheds bright
light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30
feet. Until the spell ends, you have resistance to necrotic
damage and radiant damage. You can end the spell early by
using an action to dismiss it, which creates a blast of light
in a 30-foot radius. The blast deals 4d8 radiant damage
to each creature in the area while simultaneously healing
yourself of an equal amount of damage.

By observing the stars or the position of the sun, you are
able to determine the cardinal directions, as well as the
direction and distance to a stated destination. You can’t
become directionally disoriented or lose track of the
destination. The spell doesn’t, however, reveal the best
route to your destination or warn you about deep gorges,
flooded rivers, or other impassable or treacherous terrain.

Components: V, S, M (a small sketch of a candle)
Duration: 1 hour
Description:
You touch one object that measures less than 10
feet in every dimension. Until the spell ends, the
object sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and
dim light for an additional 20 feet. The light can
be colored as you like. At the time of the casting,
you designate up to six creatures. Only those

Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 200 feet
Components: V, S, M (a magnifying lens)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

that it burns exposed flesh. You must be able to see the
sun when you cast the spell. The searing sunlight affects
a cylindrical area 50 feet in radius and 200 feet high,
centered on the a point within range. Each creature that
starts its turn in that area takes 5d8 fire damage, or half
the damage with a successful Constitution saving throw.

advantage on the saving throw. On your turn, you can use
an action to move the center of the cylinder up to 20 feet
along the ground in any direction.

the start of each of its turns while within the bright light.
Each fiend or undead in the area takes 2d4 radiant damage
at the start of each of its turns.

School: Evocation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous
Description:
You cause a mote of starlight to appear and explode in a
5-foot cube you can see within range. If a creature is in the
cube, it must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or take
1d8 radiant damage.
This spell’s damage increases to 2d8 when you reach 5th

Name: STARFALL
Level: 5
School: Evocation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous
Description:
You cause bolts of shimmering starlight to fall from the
heavens, striking up to five creatures that you can see
within range. Each bolt strikes one target, dealing 6d6
radiant damage, knocking the target prone, and blinding
it until the start of your next turn. A creature that makes a
successful Dexterity saving throw takes half the damage, is
not knocked prone, and is not blinded. If you name fewer
than five targets, excess bolts strike the ground harmlessly.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 6th level or higher, you can create one
additional bolt for each slot level above 5th.
STAR’S HEART
=== SPELL END ===

=== SPELL START ===
Name: STAR’S HEART
Level: 9
School: Transmutation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 50 feet
Components: V, S, M (an ioun stone)
Duration: 1 minute
Description:
This spell increases gravity tenfold in a 50-foot radius
centered on you. Each creature in the area other than
you drops whatever it’s holding, falls prone, becomes
incapacitated, and can’t move. If a solid object (such as the
ground) is encountered when a flying or levitating creature
falls, the creature takes three times the normal falling
damage. Any creature except you that enters the area
or starts its turn there must make a successful Strength
saving throw or fall prone and become incapacitated and
unable to move. A creature that starts its turn prone and
incapacitated makes a Strength saving throw. On a failed
save, the creature takes 8d6 bludgeoning damage; on a
successful save, it takes 4d6 bludgeoning damage, it’s no
longer incapacitated, and it can move at half speed.
All ranged weapon attacks inside the area have a normal
range of 5 feet and a maximum range of 10 feet. The same
applies to spells that create missiles that have mass, such as
flaming sphere. A creature under the influence of a freedom of
movement spell or comparable magic has advantage on the
Strength saving throws required by this spell, and its speed
isn’t reduced once it recovers from being incapacitated.
=== SPELL END ===

=== SPELL START ===
Name: SUMMON STAR
Level: 8
School: Conjuration
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 90 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Description:
You summon a friendly star from the heavens to do your
bidding. It appears in an unoccupied space you can see
within range and takes the form of a glowing humanoid
with long white hair. All creatures other than you who view
the star must make a successful Wisdom saving throw or be
charmed for the duration of the spell. A creature charmed
in this way can repeat the Wisdom saving throw at the end
of each of its turns. On a success, the creature is no longer
charmed and is immune to the effect of this casting of the
spell. In all other ways, the star is equivalent to a deva. It
understands and obeys verbal commands you give it. If you
do not give the star a command, it defends itself and attacks
the last creature that attacked it. The star disappears when
it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.
=== SPELL END ===

=== SPELL START ===
Name: TRACKING BEACON
Level: 3
School: Divination
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 120 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 8 hours
Description:
You choose a creature within range to mark with a
glowing orb of light, which floats 120 feet above the
creature’s head. The target must make a Wisdom saving
throw. On a successful save, the spell ends. On a failed
save, the light hovers above the target’s location, moving
as the target moves, which enables you to track the
creature’s direction and distance by staying within
sight of the beacon. The beacon continues to function
even when you cannot see it, as long as the target
remains on the same plane as you. If either you or the
target travels to another plane, the spell ends.
You can use a bonus action on your turn to adjust the
height of the beacon, ranging from its starting point of
120 feet to as low as 5 feet above the head of the target.
Wizards who pursue illumination magic, called
illuminators, use the stars to predict when danger is near,
and they draw on the power of light to attack their foes.
This branch of magic is popular with those who delve
underground, because its spells work best where light
is dim or absent.
How to Start: If you’re a wizard who wants
to become an illuminator, you make that
decision upon reaching 2nd level, when
you are also entitled to choose an
arcane tradition. If you decide to
follow the path of the illuminator
exclusively, you can forego the
selection of an arcane tradition
and gain the features of the
illuminator specialty instead.
You can also pursue the illuminator specialty in
conjunction with one of the standard arcane traditions. If
you choose to do this, you gain the Savant feature of your
chosen school in addition to Illumination Magic Savant
(described below). Also at 2nd level, you choose whether
to gain Omen of Warning (see below) or the 2nd-level
feature of your chosen school. Thereafter, at 6th, 10th, and
14th level, you choose between the lowest-level features
still available. For instance, a diviner might select Portent
at 2nd level and Omen of Warning at 6th level, followed
by either Expert Divination or Master of the Radiant
Heavens at 10th level.
Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the
gold and time needed to copy illumination spells into your
spellbook is halved.
Starting at 2nd level, you can forecast danger for the next
24 hours by studying the stars for 1 hour. The stars must
be visible to you for you to use this feature. Studying the
stars in this way gives you advantage on up to two initiative
rolls. The bonus remains for 24 hours or until the end of
your next long rest.
Instead of using this feature on yourself, you can grant
advantage on an initiative roll to one other creature you
can see when initiative rolls are made, but doing this
prevents you from using the benefit on yourself in that
combat. You can choose whether to use this feature at
the moment initiative is rolled, but you must make the
decision before rolling the die.
Starting when you reach 6th level, the spell attack modifier
and spell save DC for any cantrips you cast in dim light or
darkness increases by 1.
Beginning at 10th level, illusion spells you cast that require
concentration last for 1 round after you stop concentrating,
as long as the spell hasn’t exceeded its duration.
Starting at 14th level, during a long rest you can consult
the stars and comprehend some meaning in a cosmic
event. The stars must be visible to you for you to use this
ability. The insight you gather is stored as a small reserve
of magic inside an item that has meaning to you; a star
chart or an astrolabe is commonly used, but any item that
can be held in your hand will suffice. When the item is in
your hand, you can consume that stored magic as a bonus
action to produce one of the effects described below. The
insight is expended in one use, and it is lost if it hasn’t been
used within 24 hours or by the time you start your next
long rest.
Comet: Comets are the harbingers of change and
instability. You can change your appearance as if you
had cast an alter self spell, but the effect doesn’t require
concentration and lasts until you finish a long rest.
Conjunction: Planetary conjunctions destabilize
minds and emotions. You can give one creature you can see
disadvantage on a saving throw against one enchantment
or illusion spell you cast.
Eclipse: Eclipses plunge the world into darkness and
strengthen connections to the shadow plane. When you
cast a spell of 5th level or lower that deals necrotic damage,
you can reroll a number of damage dice equal to your
Intelligence modifier (minimum of one die). You must use
the new rolls.
Dwarves are renowned as shapers of the physical world.
Earth, stone, and metal bend to the will of dwarven
hammers. It’s easy to assume that because dwarves have
such great skill at shaping material, they must lack the
time and energy to become masters of the arcane, too—
but that assumption is wrong. Taking unformed matter
and shaping it to conform to one’s will is an effective way
of blending the physical and arcane arts. The dwarves’
greatest magic has come from this effort, as evidenced
by the legendary weapons, armor, and implements of
war that emerge from their mountain strongholds. Few
dwarves pursue the study of magic aside from devotion to
their deities, but one discipline bridges the gap between
creation and spellcasting: ring magic.
Ring magic is the dwarven art of forging metal into rings,
often with runes inscribed on their surface, and using
those rings to produce or bring about magical effects.
Dedicated practitioners known as ring wardens channel
their magic through specially prepared rings, increasing
the devastation wreaked upon their foes, and they can
even imbue spells into rings that they or someone else can
unleash later.
Rings created for the purpose of invoking ring magic
are more than decorative hand jewelry. They often take
the form of circlets of precious metal large enough to
adorn a weapon, a staff, or a suit of armor. Wizards who
devote themselves to ring magic are rare outside the
dwarves’ lands, but they’re instantly recognizable by the
ring-adorned stafffs they carry.
Ring Magic
Although ring magic spells often require a ring of
some form as a material component, the effects they
produce are quite distinct and variable, from illusions
to transmutations and evocations. What they have in
common is that dwarves have uncovered a way to bind the
effects into rings; the deeper arcane connection between
the rings and the spells is sometimes elusive.

or half the damage with a successful Constitution saving
throw. A creature or object dropped to 0 hit points by the
spell is reduced to fine ash.
The cylinder’s radius expands by 20 feet at the start of
each of your turns after the spell is cast. Any creatures or
objects enveloped in the enlarged area are subject to its
effects immediately.

metal chains for the duration. While bound, the target
can move only at half speed and has disadvantage on

moves more than 5 feet during a turn, it takes 3d6 piercing
damage from the barbs.
The creature can escape from the chains by using an

You lay a curse upon a ring you touch that

effects of bestow curse. The next creature that
willingly wears the ring suffers the chosen
effect with no saving throw. The curse transfers
from the ring to the wearer once the ring is put
on; the ring becomes a mundane ring that can
be taken off, but the curse remains on the creature
that wore the ring until the curse is removed or
dispelled. An identify spell cast on the cursed ring

at the end of each of its turns for 1 minute. A creature can
stop the bleeding for itself or another creature by using
an action to make a successful Wisdom (Medicine) check
against your spell save DC or by applying any amount of
magical healing.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by
1d8 for each slot level above 4th.
The ring is a powerful shape, with no beginning or end,
and potent ties to life. These feats allow any character to
experience the distinctive power of ring magic.
Prerequisite: The ability to cast at least one spell.
You have learned to create a circular flow of magic between
yourself and an allied spellcaster to bolster your spells. You
gain the following benefits:
• Increase your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma score
by 1, to a maximum of 20.
• You can spend 2 hours (which can be during a long
rest) creating a mystical bond with another spellcaster.
Both of you must spend this time in meditation, and
you must remain within 10 feet of each other. The bond
goes into effect when the meditation is over (or when
you finish your long rest). Once the bond is formed,
the two of you can bolster one another’s magic. When
one of you must make a Constitution saving throw to
maintain concentration on a spell, the other can use his
or her reaction to help maintain the effect. Both of you
make the saving throw. If either save is successful, the
caster maintains concentration. If both saves are failed,
both of you lose concentration on any spells you are
maintaining and each of you takes 2d6 psychic damage
from the strain. You can maintain this bond with only
one spellcaster at a time. If you create a new bond, the
previous one breaks. Otherwise, the bond lasts until
you finish your next long rest.
RING-BOUND
Prerequisite: The ability to cast at least one spell.
You have acquired a magic-imbued ring as a token of
respect. You gain the following benefits from the ring:
• You have advantage on saving throws against
transmutation spells.
• You can physically bind your ring to a weapon with
1 hour of work that can be completed during a short
rest. While the ring is attached to the weapon, you can
use a bonus action to make the weapon magical until
the start of your next turn. After activating this ability
twice, you must finish a short or long rest before using
it again.
• Ring wardens and others who respect the traditions
of ring magic are favorably disposed toward you. Their
starting attitude toward you automatically improves by
one step, and you have advantage on Charisma checks
related to social interaction with such individuals.
The dwarves long ago discovered the means to infuse
magic into rings, and the first ring wardens came into
being soon after that discovery came to light.
With a focus on the school of transmutation, ring wardens
blend dwarven craftsmanship with arcane might. They are
rarely encountered outside dwarven nations, but they are
easy to recognize thanks to their signature ring-staves.
Except as noted below, ring wardens function as
transmuters and use the wizard spell list.
Beginning when you select this specialty at 2nd level, the
gold and time you must spend to copy a transmutation
spell into your spellbook is halved.
In addition, the gold and time you must spend to copy a
ring magic spell into your spellbook is halved.
Also at 2nd level, you gain proficiency in your choice of
blacksmith’s tools or jeweler’s tools.
BONDED RING-STAFF
At 2nd level, you create a special quarterstaff with two
special metal rings adorning it. When you roll damage for
a spell attack while you hold your ring-staff, you can add
your proficiency bonus to the result. If the spell allows for
multiple damage rolls against multiple targets (such as with
scorching ray), you must choose which roll gains the benefit
before you roll the die. You can use this ability a number of
times equal to the number of rings on your staff. You regain
all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.
Whenever you gain a new wizard level, you can attach a
new ring to your staff by spending 8 hours of work with
blacksmith’s tools or jeweler’s tools and paying a cost of 5
gp in raw materials.
Beginning at 6th level, you can add twice your normal
proficiency bonus when you use the tools you chose at 2nd
level. When using your chosen tools to craft nonmagical
or magical items, you make twice the normal amount of
progress each day.
Additionally, you learn the method for crafting a single
kind of magic ring chosen from the following list: ring of
jumping, ring of mind shielding, ring of protection, ring of the
ram, ring of regeneration, or ring of resistance. At the GM’s
discretion, you can choose a ring not listed here. You must
meet all the standard prerequisites for crafting the ring and
pay the required gold as normal, along with providing any
special materials or meeting any conditions set by the GM.
Starting at 10th level, you can imbue magic into the special
rings that decorate your ring-staff. When you cast a spell,
instead of having it take effect normally, you can choose
to store the spell in one of the rings. As long as the spell
is stored, you can’t regain the expended spell slot. You
can remove an imbued ring from the staff and give it to
another creature (or hold it yourself) as an action.
A creature holding an imbued ring can release
the stored spell as an action. Attack rolls, saving
throws, and damage are based on the caster who
imbued the ring, but the creature holding the
ring counts as the spell’s caster for all other
purposes.
After you remove an imbued ring from the
staff, you must create a new special ring and
affix it to the staff by working for 8 hours
and spending 5 gp in raw materials. An
imbued ring is considered a magical
effect for the purpose of dispel
magic. You can have a number of
rings imbued at one time equal to
your proficiency bonus.
At 14th level or higher, with
1 hour of work (which can be
accomplished during a short rest),
you can embed a single magic
ring that you possess into your
ring-staff. The ring's rarity must be
common, uncommon, or rare. As
long as you hold the ring-staff, you
gain the effect of the embedded
ring as if you were attuned to it and wearing it (including
any negative effects of attuning to the item, such as
curses). This embedded ring doesn’t count as one of your
three allowable attuned magic items.
With one hour of work, you can remove an embedded
ring (along with its attunement) and replace it with a new
one if desired.
Writing can be an expression of magic, and a way to trap
and focus arcane energy. This precept is the foundation of
rune magic, which requires carving, writing, or otherwise
generating glyphs, sigils, signs, and runes of many kinds.
This practice is quite common among many different
people, from dwarves and druids to northlanders and
even some goblin tribes. The rune magic presented here is
somewhat northern-flavored, but it could easily serve for
dwarven runes, druidic ogham, or goblin graffiti magic.
The deeper understanding is that shapes bind power, and
that magic can be made tangible. That tangible magic can
be a stone rune, a silvery sigil, or even a bloody scrawl—its
power functions regardless of how it was made.
Rune PowersAccessing the magic inherent within runes requires the
Rune Knowledge feat. If the option to gain feats isn’t used
in your campaign, then Rune Knowledge can be gained
in place of level-based ability score improvement, if your
GM approves. Alternatively, characters might need to
accomplish other, story-related tasks determined by the
GM to gain Rune Knowledge. Once those obstacles are
cleared, all characters who meet the prerequisites can gain
Rune Knowledge and Rune Mastery. A character who
acquires the Rune Knowledge feat can begin making use
of the runes described here.
Rune Magic
When one of your rune powers calls for a saving throw, the
DC is equal to 8 + your ability modifier + your proficiency
bonus. Your applicable ability modifier is the same one
being used for the saving throw unless a different ability is
specified; for example, if a rune calls for a Charisma saving
throw, your Charisma modifier is used to set the DC.
Prerequisite: Wisdom 12 or higher
You are wise in the lore of two runes of your choice. You
always have access to the benefit that a rune provides. In
addition, you can invoke one rune power of each rune you
have learned, provided you meet any other requirements
such as a minimum level.
You can select this feat multiple times. Each time you do,
you gain the benefit and powers of two additional runes of
your choice.
Prerequisite: Rune Mastery
You have mastered the special powers of one rune. Choose
one rune that you have already learned through Rune
Knowledge. You can invoke one of its mastery powers,
provided you meet any other requirements such as a
minimum level.
You can select this feat multiple times. Each time you do,
you learn the mastery powers of a different rune from your
repertoire.
Invoking
Rune PowersInvoking one of a rune’s powers requires an action and
provokes opportunity attacks. Generally, you must either
create a physical representation of the rune (in paint, in
blood, drawn in the dirt or snow, and so forth) or trace the
shape of an existing carving of the rune that was created to
an exacting standard.
Each rune confers a benefit on someone who knows how
to scribe it. A rune’s benefit is always in effect for a character
who knows that rune. In addition, that character can call
upon one of the rune's powers when so desired. Unless
otherwise noted, any rune power can be used once, and that
expended use is regained when you finish a long rest.
Some powers have a level requirement (given in
parentheses); when a character attains that level, this
power becomes an additional choice. Mastery powers are
a separate category: only a character who has the Rune
Mastery feat for a particular rune can use its mastery power.
If a power or a mastery power has no level requirement,
it becomes available to you as soon as you acquire the
necessary feat.
If a rune’s power gives you the ability to cast a spell, you
can do so without needing any components (aside from
materials needed for the drawing of the rune), and the spell
is always cast as if using the lowest-level spell slot possible.
It typically has the same duration as a normal casting of the
spell, and uses your character level as the caster level.
When a rune power calls for a saving throw, the DC
equals 8 + your ability bonus + your proficiency bonus.
Typically, the ability that applies to the DC calculation is
the same as the ability used for the saving throw.
Rune
descriptionsThe following runes are presented in alphabetical order.
ALGIZ
Elk and reindeer, evading danger; the god
Heimdall
Benefit: You gain a +1 bonus on
initiative rolls.
Power (5th level): Living creatures that
are within 10 feet of an algiz rune when
you draw it on the ground or on a wall gain a +2 bonus
on Wisdom (Perception) checks and have advantage on
saving throws against sleep spells and other magical effects
that cause unconsciousness. Both effects last for 8 hours.
Scribing the rune takes 15 minutes.
Mastery Power (8th Level): Marking a willing
creature with the algiz rune transforms the creature into
an elk, as if by a polymorph spell. Drawing the rune on the
creature takes an action, and the change lasts while you
concentrate, for up to 1 hour.
ANSUZ
Gods and outsiders
Benefit: You gain a +1 bonus on
Intelligence (Arcana) checks to identify the
type, powers, or weaknesses of aberrations,
celestials, fey, or fiends.
Power: Once per day, the ansuz rune can be sketched on
an object to ward off giants and fey hostile to the Aesir. The
object must be presented boldly toward such creatures,
each of which must make a Charisma saving throw. On a
failed save, the creature must stay at least 5 feet away from
the rune and cannot touch or make melee attacks against
the creature presenting it, as long as the symbol is boldly
and aggressively presented (which requires an action each
round). Sketching the rune takes an action, and the marked
object remains effective for 1 minute.
Power (7th level): If you sketch ansuz on a floor or a
wall, each of your allies within 10 feet of it can roll a d4 and
add the result to each of its attack rolls, similar to the effect
of a bless spell. Sketching the rune takes two actions, and it
remains effective thereafter for as long as you concentrate,
for up to 1 minute.
Mastery Power (11th level): When you trace ansuz
on the forehead of a willing creature, the creature falls
into a trance, during which it receives a message from the
gods (identical in effect to a divination spell). A creature
can experience only one such trance per week. Tracing the
rune takes 10 minutes, and the trance lasts for 1 round.
Birch tree, love, new beginnings; the Bear Maiden
Benefit: You gain a +1 bonus on Charisma
(Persuasion) checks.
Power: When you trace berkanan on a
living creature, the rune grants the creature
advantage on a single Charisma (Persuasion) check of
its choosing. Tracing the rune takes 10 minutes, and it
remains effective for up to 1 hour.
When you trace this rune on a living plant, an effect
identical to a spike growth spell erupts in a 20-foot radius
around the rune. Tracing the rune on a plant takes an
action, and the effect lasts while you concentrate, for up to
10 minutes.
Mastery Power (8th level): You can create a philter of
love once a week.
DAGAZ
Day and laying the dead to rest
Benefit: You can always tell whether a
creature you can see within 10 feet of you
is alive or dead.
Power (4th level): If you use an action
to trace dagaz on a creature that is blinded,
deafened, paralyzed, poisoned, or diseased, the creature’s
affliction is cured as if by a lesser restoration spell.
Power (6th level): Tracing dagaz on an object makes
it give off bright light in a 60-foot radius and dim light for
60 feet beyond that. Magical darkness of 3rd level or lower
is dispelled in an area where this light overlaps it. The
light is blocked as normal by opaque objects or structures.
Tracing the rune for this purpose takes an action, and the
light lasts while you concentrate, for up to 1 hour.
Mastery Power (13th level): Once a week, you
can sketch dagaz on the ground or a wall to create an
instantaneous effect identical to a cleric’s Turn Undead
class feature. Sketching the rune takes an action, and it
affects undead within 30 feet that can see it at the moment
of its completion.
EHWAZ
Horses, freedom, the Nithing Pole
Benefit: You gain a +1 bonus to Wisdom
(Animal Handling) checks made to
control a mount, and to Dexterity checks
made to wriggle free of bonds.
Power (5th level): Using an action to trace ehwaz on
a lock or a set of shackles has the same effect as casting a
knock spell, but makes no sound.
Mastery Power (8th level): When you sketch ehwaz
on the ground, you can produce the effect of a phantom steed
spell. Sketching the rune takes 5 minutes, and the illusory
steed remains for 1 hour or until it takes damage.
Mastery Power (9th level): You can create a nithing
pole once per month. The process can be performed
only during a new moon, takes 12 hours, and requires
bloodletting that leaves a permanent scar in the shape of
the ehwaz rune on the rune maker’s left hand. Each new
use of this power creates a new scar; those after the first
don’t need to be on the hand, but they must be on the
hands or arms.
Wondrous item, rare
A nithing pole is crafted to exact retribution for an act of
cowardice or dishonor. It is a sturdy wooden staff, 6 to
10 feet long, carved with runes that name the dishonored
target of the staff ’s curse. The carved shaft is draped in
horsehide, topped with a horse’s skull, and placed where its
target is expected to pass by; typically, the pole is driven into
the ground or wedged into a rocky cleft in a remote spot,
where the intended victim won’t see it until it’s too late.
A pole is created to punish a certain person for a specific
crime. The target must be named on the pole; a description
such as “the person who blinded Lars Gustafson” isn’t
precise enough. The moment the target approaches within
60 feet, the pole casts bestow curse (with a range of 60 feet
instead of touch) on the target. The DC for the target’s
Wisdom saving throw is 15. On a successful save, the pole
recasts the spell every round until the target’s saving throw
is a failure, the target retreats out of range, or the nithing
pole is destroyed. Anyone other than the pole’s creator who
tries to destroy or knock down a nithing pole is also targeted
by a bestow curse spell, but only once.
You determine the effect of the curse when the pole is
created. The pole becomes nonmagical only after it has
laid its curse on its intended target; an untriggered and
forgotten nithing pole remains dangerous for centuries. The
curse, once activated, lasts for 8 hours and doesn’t require
concentration.
EIWAZ
Yew tree, Yggdrasil
Benefit: You have proficiency on
Intelligence (Arcana) checks.
Power (4th level): Spending an action
to trace eiwaz onto a suitably sized piece of
wood subjects it to the effect of a shillelagh spell
for 1 minute. This power is usable at will.
Mastery Power (8th level): If you take 1 minute to
write out three questions on a piece of paper or parchment
and trace eiwaz on the bottom of the sheet, you can later
produce an effect similar to a contact other plane spell
(including the possible negative consequences). If you
later sleep for at least 10 minutes while holding the sheet,
your dreams yield answers to those questions that you
can receive when you awaken if you make a successful
Intelligence saving throw.
Mastery Power (11th level): When carved on the
bark of a living tree, eiwaz allows you to travel between
that tree and another tree within 500 feet that you have
previously marked with eiwaz, as if both were under the
effect of a tree stride spell. Each carving takes an action,
and the effect lasts while you concentrate, for up to 1
minute after the second carving is finished.
FEHU
Cattle, livestock, and wealth
Benefit: You have advantage on Wisdom
(Animal Handling) checks concerning
domesticated animals that aren’t used as
riding mounts.
Power: Sketching fehu on an object makes that item
easier to lift or drag, as if it were only half its actual weight.
Sketching the rune takes 1 minute, and the effect lasts
while you concentrate, for up to 1 hour. This power works
equally well on a single object, such as a block of stone, or
on a collection of objects that are bundled together, such
as a large chest stuffed with coins.
Mastery Power (8th level): By spending 1 minute
tracing fehu on your skin, you can cast dominate beast as
though from a 6th-level spell slot. The effect must be used
within 10 minutes of completing the tracing, or the rune’s
power dissipates.
GEBU
Generosity and hospitality, gifts
Benefit: You have advantage on Intelligence
checks to estimate an item’s value.
Power: When you spend 1 minute carefully
examining an item while tracing gebu on it, you learn the
item’s name and magical properties, as if you had cast an
identify spell. Alternatively, if you use an action to trace
gebu on a willing creature, that creature gains the effect
of a sanctuary spell. (You can’t use this power on yourself.)
The effect lasts while you concentrate, for up to 1 minute.
Mastery Power (8th level): To use this power, you
take an action to scratch or sketch gebu on a wall, floor,
or other surface of an enclosed space, in a place where it
is clearly visible. For up to 1 minute thereafter, you can
activate the rune with a command word, provided you
are within 20 feet of it. When you do so, each creature
within 20 feet of the rune and with a clear line of sight to
it (regardless of whether the creature can actually see it)
must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, a
creature is affected as if by a calm emotions spell that lasts
while you concentrate, for up to 1 minute.
Hail, winter weather
Benefit: You have advantage on Wisdom
(Survival) checks to predict weather conditions
for the next 24 hours in your vicinity.
Power: If you take an action to trace hagalaz on a willing
creature, it receives the benefit of a protection from energy
(cold) spell while you concentrate, for up to 1 hour.
Mastery Power (9th level): When you sketch hagalaz
on the ground under the open sky, you produce the effect
of a sleet storm centered on a point you choose within 150
feet. Sketching the rune takes 4 rounds, and the storm
lasts while you concentrate, for up to 2 minutes.
Mastery Power (14th level): When hagalaz is
sketched on the ground inside the area of an effect caused
by sleet storm, ice storm, control weather (hail or blizzard
only), or a similar spell, the rune brings about a dispel magic
effect as if that spell had been cast with a 7th-level slot. If
the effect being dispelled is from 8th- or 9th-level magic,
you use Charisma for the ability check to determine the
rune’s effectiveness. Sketching the rune takes 2 rounds.
Mastery Power (14th level): When hagalaz is
sketched on the ground inside the area of a natural
(nonmagical) storm, the rune brings about the effect of a
control weather spell. Sketching the rune takes 1 hour, and
the control lasts while you concentrate, for up to 8 hours.
Ancestors, major deities
Benefit: You have proficiency on
Intelligence (History) checks.
Power (4th level): When you use an
action to trace ingwaz on a spear, the first character who
uses the spear against an enemy adds 1d4 radiant damage
to attacks made with the spear. The first attack must be
made within 8 hours after the rune is traced, and the
benefit lasts for 1 minute after it is triggered.
Power (5th level): When you trace ingwaz on the
face of a willing creature, the creature gains the benefit
of the barbarian’s Rage class feature, as though it were a
barbarian of your character level. Tracing the rune takes
two actions, and the effect lasts for 1 minute.
Mastery Power (8th level): When ingwaz is traced
on the flesh of a corpse, the rune creates the effect of a
speak with dead spell on that corpse. Tracing the rune takes
1 minute, and the effect lasts while you concentrate, for up
to 10 minutes.
ISAZ
Ice, imprisonment, paralysis
Benefit: Whenever you take cold damage, that
damage is reduced by 1.
Power (4th level): When you take an action
to sketch isaz on the ground, slick ice spreads out
from that point to cover an area of 225 square feet. The
iced area can have any shape you want, as long as every
square of ice has at least one side in common with another
square of ice; on a grid of 5-foot squares, the ice can
cover as many as 9 squares. Ice-filled squares are difficult
terrain, and the DC of Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks made
in the area increases by 5. The ice is nonmagical and melts
normally.
Power (5th level): When isaz is traced on a weapon,
the weapon sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim
light for 10 feet beyond that, and it deals an extra 1d4 cold
damage on a hit. Tracing the rune takes an action, and the
effect lasts while you concentrate, for up to 1 hour.
Mastery Power (8th level): A shield marked with
this rune glitters like frost in the morning sun. As an
action, a wielder of the shield who is in direct sunlight can
use it to focus reflected light on a single creature within
30 feet. The target must make a successful Constitution
saving throw or become blinded. The DC for the saving
throw equals 8 + your Dexterity bonus + your proficiency
bonus. Marking the shield takes an action, and the rune
remains effective while you concentrate, for up to 1 hour.
JERA
Abundant harvest; the gods Frey and Freya
Benefit: You have proficiency on
Intelligence (Nature) checks.
Power (4th level): When jera is traced
on the belly of a living creature, the rune
guarantees that any sexual union involving that creature
in the next 24 hours proves fruitful. If the rune is traced
on a pregnant creature at least once per month during its
pregnancy, the act guarantees a successful birth and healthy
offspring. Tracing the rune takes an action.
Power (6th level): When jera is traced on a wooden
table, plate, or platter, all food and drink that’s spoiled,
rotten, diseased, poisonous, or otherwise contaminated
within 20 feet of that object becomes pure and safe for
consumption. Tracing the rune takes an action.
Mastery Power (8th level): When jera is drawn in the
earth among living plants, the effect of a plant growth spell
arises in a 100-foot radius around the rune. Sketching the
rune takes an action.
Flaming torch, enlightenment, ulcers
Benefit: You gain darkvision out to
a range of 30 feet. If you already have
darkvision, you gain proficiency on Wisdom
(Perception) checks.
Power (4th level): When you spend 1 minute tracing
kaunen on the ground, that spot burns like a campfire for
up to 8 hours. The fire is 2 feet in diameter, and the flames
deal 2d6 fire damage to any creature that ends its turn in
the fire. It provides warmth as a campfire, but the flame
cannot be transported or used to set other objects afire.
Power (5th level): Tracing kaunen onto a weapon
causes that weapon to shed bright light in a 10-foot radius
and dim light for 10 feet beyond that, and the weapon
deals an extra 1d6 fire damage on a hit. Tracing the rune
takes an action, and the effect lasts while you concentrate,
for up to 1 hour.
Mastery Power (8th level): When you use an action
to trace the rune on a living creature, kaunan produces the
effect of a lesser restoration spell on that creature.
Water, the sea, the god Njord
Benefit: You gain Aquan as a bonus
language. If you already know this
language, you have advantage on Charisma
(Persuasion) checks involving creatures from
the Elemental Plane of Water.
Power (4th level): When you take an action to trace
laukaz on an object, it becomes more buoyant for 24
hours. Anyone grasping the object has advantage on
Strength (Athletics) checks to swim or to stay afloat.
Power (7th level): When you trace laukaz on a living
creature’s chest, the creature gains the benefit of a water
breathing spell. Tracing the rune takes an action, and the
effect lasts for 24 hours.
Mastery Power (11th level): When you draw the
rune on the surface of a lakebed, a riverbed, or the sea
bottom, you can manipulate a 100-foot cube of the nearby
water as if by a control water spell. Sketching the rune takes
an action, and the effect lasts while you concentrate, for up
to 10 minutes.
Humanoids, especially humans and dwarves
Benefit: You gain a +1 bonus on saving
throws against petrification and against
effects that alter your form, such as
lycanthropy, polymorph, or flesh to stone.
Power (5th level): When mannaz is traced on the
ground, a boulder, or a wall, it produces the effect of a calm
emotions spell on all living creatures within 20 feet of the
rune. Tracing the rune takes an action, and the effect lasts
while you concentrate, for up to 1 minute.
Mastery Power (8th level): When you use an action
to trace mannaz on the flesh of a creature, the act returns a
lycanthrope to its humanoid form or dispels (as if by dispel
magic) a polymorph effect the target is currently under. An
unwilling creature can resist this change with a successful
Charisma saving throw (using your Wisdom modifier to
set the DC).
Mastery Power (9th level): Tracing mannaz on a
plant or animal causes it to be affected as if by the awaken
spell. Drawing the rune in this way takes 8 hours, and the
effect is permanent.
Necessity and filling needs
Benefit: Once a day, you can cast spare
the dying.
Power (4th level): By spending an action
to trace naudiz on an item, you grant a
creature that touches the item the benefit of
a guidance or resistance spell (creature’s choice). A number
of creatures equal to your proficiency bonus can benefit
from this effect. Both the rune and the effect last while you
concentrate, for up to 1 minute.
Power (5th level): You can trace naudiz in the air in
such a way that five creatures within 10 feet of you have
their hit point maximums increased by 5, and each gains 5
hit points. Tracing the rune takes an action, and the effect
lasts for 8 hours.
Mastery Power (15th level): When you use an action
to trace naudiz on an object weighing no more than 20
pounds, you can call that item to you once during the
next 24 hours if it is anywhere within 400 feet. The item
teleports into your hand instantly when you use an action
to call it. If another creature is holding the object, that
creature prevents it from teleporting with a successful
Charisma saving throw (using your Wisdom modifier to
set the DC).
NYKÖPING
Passage of time, the seasons, phases of
the moon
Benefit: You gain proficiency on
Wisdom (Survival) checks.
Power (5th level): When nyköping
is sketched on the ground, up to six
creatures of your choice can each regain hit points equal
to 2d8 + your Wisdom modifier. You must be able to see
the creatures, and they must be within 30 feet of you.
Sketching the rune in this way takes 10 minutes.
Power (6th level): When you take an action to trace
the rune on the ground under an open sky, nyköping
creates the effect of a gust of wind spell. The wind lasts
while you concentrate, for up to 1 minute.
Mastery Power (9th level): Tracing nyköping on
a creature grants it the benefit of a haste spell. Drawing
the rune takes an action, and the effect lasts while you
concentrate, for up to 1 minute.
Mastery Power (13th level): When you sketch
nyköping on the ground beneath the open sky, the weather
in the area improves toward clear skies, as if you had cast
control weather. The rune can only improve the weather, not
make it more severe. Sketching the rune takes 1 hour, and
the effect lasts for 8 hours.
Property, inheritance, family
Benefit: You gain proficiency on
Charisma (Persuasion) checks.
Power (7th level): When this rune
is traced on a reflective surface (for
example, a mirror, a polished shield, or
even still water), otalan lets you scry on an object that you
have possessed for at least one week, or on any member of
your immediate family within three generations of you, as
if subjected to the scrying spell. Tracing the rune takes 10
minutes, and the effect lasts while you concentrate, for up
to 10 minutes.
Mastery Power (13th level): When otalan is invoked
on an object, the rune’s power lingers harmlessly in the
item until the death of the item’s owner. The moment
that creature dies, the object teleports into the hands of
another individual whose identity is specified when the
rune is created. This person can be described by name, by
title, or by relationship (for example, “the king of Noatun”
or “my firstborn son”). This power functions over any
range as long as the object and the individual are on the
same plane. If another creature is holding the object when
its owner dies, that creature can prevent the object from
teleporting by making a successful Charisma saving throw
(using your Wisdom modifier to set the DC). The rune
remains effective until it is triggered or until you use this
power to invoke the rune on a different object. Preparing
the object takes 10 minutes.
PERTO
Things not as they seem, the god Loki
Benefit: You gain a +1 bonus on
Wisdom ability checks to solve riddles or
puzzles, and on Wisdom saving throws
against illusions.
Power (4th level): When you take an
action to trace perto on a creature, you can change the
creature’s appearance as if by a disguise self spell. If the
creature has Intelligence 3 or higher, it decides how to
change its appearance. The effect persists for 1 hour.
Mastery Power (8th level): Spending an action to
trace perto on the ground causes all objects within 10
feet of the rune to be undetectable by divination magic or
scrying sensors. The effect lasts for 8 hours.
RAIDO
Travel
Benefit: Your speed is 5 feet faster than
the norm for your race, and you always
know which way is north.
Power (4th level): The possessor of
an object that has had raido sketched on it has advantage
on Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks to ski, skate, or control a
sled. Sketching the rune in this way takes 1 minute, and the
effect lasts while you concentrate, up to 1 hour.
Power (5th level): By using an action to trace raido on
your skin, you bestow the benefit of a water walk spell on
yourself and up to five other creatures of your choice that
you can see.
Power (7th level): If you take 1 minute to sketch raido
on the sole of your foot or boot, you gain the ability to
engage in a forced march for 12 hours instead of the usual 8
hours before risking exhaustion. You can impart this ability
on up to five other creatures of your choice that you can
see, but all of you must travel together for the entire period.
The effect ends 12 hours after your forced march begins,
regardless of whether you are traveling at that time.
The sun, the god Balder
Benefit: You gain immunity to the
blinded condition.
Power (5th level): When traced on a
creature, sowilo grants it magical confidence
and magnetism, enabling it to use an enthrall
effect on an audience, as with the spell. Tracing the rune
takes an action, and the effect lasts for 1 minute.
Power (7th level): Spending an action tracing sowilo on
an object makes it glow, as if by the daylight spell, for 1 hour.
Mastery Power (13th level): Spending an action
drawing sowilo on the brow of a creature causes its eyes
to emit a brilliant light, as a sunbeam spell. The creature is
immune to the blinded condition for the duration of the
effect, which lasts while you concentrate, for up to 1 minute.
TEWAZ
Fearlessness, assemblies or councils, the god Tyr
Benefit: You gain advantage on saving
throws against the frightened condition.
Power (4th level): Tewaz can be sketched
on an object to ward off wolves, worgs,
werewolves, and other lupine creatures. The
object must be presented boldly toward such creatures,
each of which makes a Charisma saving throw. On a failed
save, the creature must stay at least 5 feet away from the
rune and cannot touch or make melee attacks against
the creature presenting it, as long as the symbol is boldly
and aggressively presented (which requires an action
each round). Sketching the rune takes an action, and the
marked object remains effective for 1 hour.
Power (5th level): When tewaz is sketched somewhere
clearly visible, it produces the effect of a calm emotions spell
on all creatures that can see it within a 20-foot radius.
Sketching the rune takes an action, and the effect lasts
while you concentrate, for up to 1 minute.
Giants, thunder and lightning
Benefit: You gain Giant as a bonus
language. If you already know this
language, you gain advantage on Wisdom
(Insight) checks involving giants.
Power (4th level): A weapon marked
with turisaz deals an extra 1d4 lightning damage on each
of the next five times it hits its target within the next hour.
Marking the weapon takes an action.
Power (5th level): Armor marked with turisaz has
resistance to lightning damage and grants a +2 bonus to
the wearer’s Strength score. Marking the armor takes an
action, and the effect lasts while you concentrate, for up
to 1 hour.
Mastery Power (8th level): When inscribed on a
surface, the turisaz rune acts as a glyph of warding that deals
6d8 lightning damage if triggered. Sketching the rune
takes 1 hour, and the effect lasts for up to 24 hours, or until
the glyph is triggered or dispelled.
URUZ
Wild oxen, sacrifice to the gods, strength
Benefit: You gain a +2 bonus to
your Strength score for the purpose of
determining carrying capacity.
Power (4th level): The wielder of a
shield that has been inscribed with uruz
gains the benefits of the Charger feat. Tracing the rune
takes 1 minute, and the effect lasts for 1 hour.
Power (5th level): When uruz is traced on the flesh of
a living creature, the creature’s carrying capacity doubles,
and the creature has advantage on Strength checks.
Tracing the rune takes an action, and the effect lasts while
you concentrate, for up to 1 hour.
Mastery Power (8th level): When you trace this rune
on an appropriate sacrifice (food, a symbolic weapon, an
animal), any offenses the sacrifice giver has committed
against the gods are forgiven (treat as a remove curse effect).
Tracing the rune in this way takes 1 hour, and the sacrifice
must be offered no more than 1 hour later.
WUNJO
Happiness and joy
Benefit: After using inspiration or
gifting it to another player, you have a
20 percent chance to retain it. If you use
inspiration that was retained in this way, it
can’t be retained again.
Power (4th level): Tracing the wunjo rune on the
ground or on a boulder creates the effect of an animal
friendship spell on one beast within 30 feet. Tracing the
rune takes an action, and the effect lasts for 24 hours.
Mastery Power (8th level): If you use an action to
sketch wunjo on an object that you then hold aloft, your
allies that can see you have advantage on saving throws
against fear, charm, and domination effects. The effect
lasts while you concentrate, for up to 10 minutes.
Darkness brings a tingle to the spine, reminding us of a
time when we felt trapped without light and the darkness
itself seemed a companion to fear.
When the light goes out, the hair on the back of your
neck stands up. Was that the wind, or is something
lurking in the dark, waiting to attack you? When nature’s
deadliest predators hunt in darkness, their ability to see
when we can’t makes us feel weak against their power.
Shadow magic can lend a sinister feel to an NPC, or
cast a player character as a cursed hero who uses the
power of darkness for good—at the cost of his or her
soul. Spellcasters who manipulate shadow draw this
mysterious, unsettling energy from alien dimensions
and turn it to their own uses.

=== SPELL START ===
Name: BECOME NIGHTWING
Level: 6
School: Enchantment
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self
Components: V, S, M (a crow’s eye)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Description:
This spell imbues you with wings of shadow. For the
duration of the spell, you gain a flying speed of 60 feet and
a new attack action: Nightwing Breath.
Nightwing Breath (Recharge 4–6). You exhale
shadow-substance in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in the
area takes 5d6 necrotic damage, or half the damage with a
successful Dexterity saving throw.
=== SPELL END ===

=== SPELL START ===
Name: BLACK HAND
Level: 4
School: Necromancy
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 30 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Description:
You gather the powers of darkness into your fist and fling
dark, paralyzing flame at a target within 30 feet. If you
make a successful ranged spell attack, this spell siphons
vitality from the target into you. For the duration, the
target has disadvantage (and you have advantage) on
attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws made with
Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution. An affected target
makes a Constitution saving throw (with disadvantage) at
the end of its turn, ending the effect on a success.
=== SPELL END ===

=== SPELL START ===
Name: BLACK RIBBONS
Level: 1
School: Conjuration
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 40 feet
Components: V, S, M (a piece of ribbon)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Description:
You pull pieces of the plane of shadow into your own
reality, causing a 20-foot cube to fill with inky ribbons that
turn the area into difficult terrain and wrap around nearby
creatures. Any creature that ends its turn in the area
becomes restrained by the ribbons until the end of its next
turn, unless it makes a successful Dexterity saving throw.
Once a creature succeeds on this saving throw, it can’t be
restrained again by the ribbons, but it’s still affected by the
difficult terrain.
=== SPELL END ===

=== SPELL START ===
Name: BLACK WELL
Level: 6
School: Necromancy
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 300 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Description:
You summon a seething sphere of dark energy 5 feet
in diameter at a point within range. The sphere pulls
creatures toward it and devours the life force of those it
envelops. Every creature other than you that starts its turn
within 90 feet of the black well must make a successful
Strength saving throw or be pulled 50 feet toward the
well. A creature pulled into the well takes 6d8 necrotic
damage and is stunned; a successful Constitution saving
throw halves the damage and causes the creature to
become incapacitated. A creature that starts its turn inside
the well also makes a Constitution saving throw; the
creature is stunned on a failed save or incapacitated on
a success. An incapacitated creature that leaves the well
recovers immediately and can take actions and reactions
on that turn. A creature takes damage only upon entering
the well—it takes no additional damage for remaining
there—but if it leaves the well and is pulled back in again,
it takes damage again. A total of nine Medium creatures,
three Large creatures, or one Huge creature can be inside
the well’s otherdimensional space at one time. When the
spell’s duration ends, all creatures inside it tumble out in a
heap, landing prone.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage dealt by the
well increases by 1d8—and the well pulls creatures an
additional 5 feet—for each slot level above 6th.

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Description:
You conjure a shadow mastiff from the plane of shadow.
This creature obeys your verbal commands to aid you in
battle or to seek out a specific creature. It has the body
of a large dog with a smooth black coat, 2 feet high at the
shoulder and weighing 200 pounds.
The mastiff is friendly to you and your companions. Roll
initiative for the mastiff; it acts on its own turn. It obeys
simple, verbal commands from you, within its ability to
act. Giving a command takes no action on your part.
The mastiff disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or
when the spell ends.
Medium monstrosity, neutral evil
Armor Class 14
Hit Points 30 (4d8 +12)
Speed 50 ft.

Challenge: 2 (200 XP)
Bay. When a shadow mastiff howls, all creatures within a 300-
foot radius who are not evil monstrosities must succeed on
a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be panicked. On each of
its turns, a panicked creature must take the Dash action and
move away from the mastiff by the safest and shortest route,
if such a route exists. If the target moves out of range of this
ability, the effect ends.
Scent. Shadow mastiffs have advantage on all Wisdom checks
that rely on their sense of smell.
Shadow Blend. Shadow mastiffs can hide in any condition of
illumination other than bright light.
Trip. Whenever a shadow mastiff hits an opponent with a bite
attack for the first time on a turn, the opponent falls prone
unless it succeeds on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a
failed save, the shadow mastiff makes an immediate second
bite attack as a bonus action.
Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
Hit: 7 (1d6+3) piercing damage.

School: Evocation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Description:
You shape shadows into claws that grow from your fingers
and drip inky blackness. The claws have a reach of 10 feet.
While the spell lasts, you can make a melee spell attack
with them that deals 1d10 cold damage.
=== SPELL END ===

Name: CLOAK OF SHADOW
Level: 1
School: Illusion

Name: CONJURE SHADOW TITAN
Level: 7
School: Conjuration
Casting Time: 1 minute
Range: 90 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour
Description:
You summon a shadow titan, which appears
in an unoccupied space that you can see
within range. The shadow titan’s statistics are
identical to a stone giant’s, with two differences: its
camouflage ability works in dim light instead of rocky
terrain, and the “rocks” it hurls are composed of
shadow-stuff and cause cold damage.
The shadow titan is friendly to you and your
companions. Roll initiative for the shadow
titan; it acts on its own turn. It obeys verbal
or telepathic commands that you issue to it
(giving a command takes no action on your
part). If you don’t issue any commands to
the shadow titan, it defends itself from hostile
creatures but otherwise takes no actions.
The shadow titan disappears when it drops
to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.
=== SPELL END ===

=== SPELL START ===
Name: CREEPING DARKNESS
Level: 8
School: Conjuration
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Description:
You create a great, writhing mass of shadows that move
slowly in a direction you choose. The grasping, shadowy
tendrils occupy up to three 10-foot cubes within range.
The mass has a speed of 20 feet, and it moves each round
at the end of your turn, ignoring difficult terrain. The
shadows can also move vertically or across a ceiling, as
long as they can travel along a surface on which to cling.
All light in this area is reduced to dim light. The surface
covered by the darkness is considered difficult terrain.
If the darkness moves into the space occupied by a living
creature, that creature takes 6d6 necrotic damage and is
restrained. The creature must make a Constitution saving
throw. On a successful save, the creature takes half the
damage and is not restrained. Any creature in the area
of the spell at the start of its turn must make another
Constitution saving throw, taking damage in each
round that it remains in the area. Restrained creatures
move with the darkness, dragged along by the shadowy
tendrils. A creature can take an action on its turn to make
a Strength check against your spell save DC to free itself
from the tendrils.
Bright light can destroy portions of the spell. One 5-foot
cube is destroyed if it takes 12 radiant damage. As long as
at least one 5-foot cube occupies all or part of a creature’s
space, the creature remains restrained.
=== SPELL END ===

=== SPELL START ===
Name: DARK DEMENTING
Level: 5
School: Illusion
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 120 feet
Components: V, S, M (a moonstone)
Duration: 10 minutes
Description:
A dark shadow creeps across the target’s mind and leaves a
small bit of shadow essence behind, triggering a profound
fear of the dark. A creature you designate within range
must make a Charisma saving throw. If it fails, the target
becomes frightened of you for the duration. A frightened
creature can repeat the saving throw each time it takes
damage, ending the effect on a success. While frightened
in this way, the creature will not willingly enter or attack
into a space that isn’t brightly lit. If it’s in dim light or
darkness, the creature must either move toward bright
light or create its own (by lighting a lantern, casting a light
spell, or the like).
=== SPELL END ===

=== SPELL START ===
Name: DARK PATH
Level: 2
School: Conjuration
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 30 feet
Components: V, S, M (a lodestone)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Description:
You conjure a shadowy road between two points within
range to create a bridge or path. This effect can bridge a
chasm or create a smooth path through difficult terrain.
The dark path is 10 feet wide and up to 50 feet long. It
can support up to 500 pounds of weight at one time. A
creature that adds more weight than the path can support
sinks through the path as if it didn’t exist.
=== SPELL END ===

=== SPELL START ===
Name: DARKBOLT
Level: 2
School: Evocation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous
Description:
You utter a quick invocation to create a black nimbus
around your hand, then hurl three rays of darkness at one
or more targets in range. The rays can be divided between
targets however you like. Make a ranged spell attack for
each target (not each ray); each ray that hits deals 1d10 cold
damage. A target that was hit by one or more rays must
make a successful Constitution saving throw or be unable
to use reactions until the start of its next turn.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell
slot of 3rd level or higher, you create one additional ray for
each slot level above 2nd.

School: Transmutation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 30 feet

source of light within range. This spell extinguishes a
torch, a candle, a lantern, or a light or dancing lights cantrip.

=== SPELL START ===
Name: DYING OF THE LIGHT
Level: 7
School: Evocation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 120 feet
Components: V, S, M (a black pearl worth 250 gp)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Description:
A wave of withering darkness erupts from you, filling a
120-foot-radius sphere and extinguishing any nonmagical
light sources in the area. Any light produced by spells
of 6th level or lower is dispelled. Magic items (but not
artifacts) that give off light have that property suppressed
while in the spell’s area. Any light sources brought into the
area during the spell’s duration are likewise extinguished.
Light-producing spells of 7th level or higher function
within the area.
Nonmagical light sources removed from the area can be
reignited. Magic items regain their ability to give off light
1 round after leaving the area. This magical darkness foils
darkvision, except for creatures that can see in magical
darkness, such as devils. You can see within the area of the
spell as if it were brightly lit.
Each creature you choose to be affected that ends its
turn in the darkness takes 4d8 necrotic damage and gains
one level of exhaustion. A successful Constitution saving
throw halves the damage and negates the exhaustion.
HIDE IN ONE’S SHADOW
=== SPELL END ===

=== SPELL START ===
Name: HIDE IN ONE’S SHADOW
Level: 4
School: Transmutation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Touch
Components: S, M (charcoal)
Duration: 3 hours
Description:
When you touch a willing creature with a piece of charcoal
while casting this spell, the target and everything it carries
blends into and becomes part of the target’s shadow, which
remains discernible, although its body seems to disappear.
The shadow is incorporeal, has no weight, and is immune
to all but psychic and radiant damage. The target remains
aware of its surroundings and can move, but only as a
shadow could move—flowing along surfaces as if the
creature were moving normally. The creature can step out
of the shadow at will, resuming its physical shape in the
shadow’s space and ending the spell.
This spell cannot be cast in an area devoid of light, where
a shadow would not normally appear. Even a faint light
source, such as moonlight or starlight, is sufficient. If that
light source is removed, or if the shadow is flooded with
light in such a way that the physical creature wouldn’t cast
a shadow, the spell ends and the creature reappears in the
shadow’s space.
=== SPELL END ===

Name: LEGION
Level: 3
School: Conjuration
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S, M (a toy soldier)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Description:
You call down a legion of shadowy soldiers in a 10-foot
cube. Their features resemble a mockery of once-living
creatures. Whenever a creature starts its turn inside the
cube or within 5 feet of it, or enters the cube for the first
time on its turn, the conjured shades make an attack
using your melee spell attack modifier; on a hit, the target
takes 3d8 necrotic damage. The space inside the cube is
difficult terrain.

Duration: Instantaneous
Description:
You create a shadow-tunnel between your location and
one other creature you can see within range. You and that

is unwilling to exchange places with you, it can resist the
effect by making a Charisma saving throw. On a successful
save, the spell has no effect.

Duration: 1 round
Description:
You make a melee spell attack against a creature you
touch that has darkvision as an innate ability; on a hit, the
target’s darkvision is negated until the spell ends. This spell
has no effect against darkvision that derives from a spell or
a magic item. The target retains all of its other senses.
5th-level conjuration (ritual) (shadow)
Casting Time: 1o minutes
Range: 30 feet
Components: V, S, M (a piece of black chalk)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
By drawing a circle of black chalk up to 15 feet in diameter
and chanting for one minute during the casting time,
you open a portal directly into the Plane of Shadow. The
portal fills the chalk circle and appears as a vortex of inky
blackness; nothing can be seen through it. Any object or
creature that passes through the portal instantly arrives
safely at the destination. The portal remains open for 1
minute or until you stop concentrating on the spell, and it
can be used to travel between the Plane of Shadow and the
chalk circle, in both directions, as many times as desired
during the spell’s duration.

School: Evocation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self (10-foot cone)
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous
Description:
A freezing blast of shadow explodes out from you in a
10-foot cone. Any creature caught in the shadow takes
2d4 necrotic damage and is frightened; a successful
Wisdom saving throw halves the damage and negates the
frightened condition.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage dealt by the
attack increases by 2d4 for each slot level above 1st.

Name: SHADOW METAMORPHOSIS
Level: 6
School: Transmutation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Description:
You touch a creature of Huge size or smaller, or a single
object no more than 20 feet in any dimension, and
transform it into malleable shadow-stuff. Objects under
the effect of the spell are not immaterial, but are easy to
shape or compress. One could not walk through a door
that is affected by the spell, but the door could be pulled
aside like a curtain and bypassed, or pulled up like the
bottom edge of a tent flap and crawled under, even if the
door was locked.
An unwilling creature can make a Constitution saving
throw, avoiding the effect on a success. A creature under
the effect of the spell is amorphous and can move through
a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing. In
dim light or darkness, the creature has advantage on
Dexterity (Stealth) checks. A creature under the effect
of this spell cannot make attacks or cast spells and has
vulnerability to radiant damage.

Name: SHADOW MONSTERS
Level: 4
School: Illusion
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 120 feet
Components: V, S, M (a doll)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Description:
You choose up to two creatures within range. Each
creature must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed
save, the creature perceives its allies as hostile, shadowy
monsters, and it must attack its nearest ally. An affected
creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of
its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can target one
additional creature for each slot level above 4th.

Name: SHADOW PUPPETS
Level: 2
School: Illusion
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S, M (a pinch of powdered lead)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Description:
You animate the shadow of a creature within range,
causing it to attack that creature. As a bonus action when
you cast the spell, or as an action on subsequent rounds
while you maintain concentration, make a melee spell
attack against the creature. If it hits, the target takes 2d8
psychic damage and must make a successful Intelligence
saving throw or be incapacitated until the start of your
next turn.

spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by
1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.

Level: 4
School: Conjuration
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Description:
You can open a temporary portal between two darkened
areas, allowing you to move from one such area to another
without crossing the intervening space. If you start your
turn in an area of dim light or darkness, you can open a
portal to another area of dim light or darkness within
range and transport yourself to that spot. Doing this uses
up your movement for the turn, regardless of the distance
traveled. You can use shadow step while prone. Moving in
this manner does not draw opportunity attacks.

Name: SHADOW TENDRILS
Level: 3
School: Necromancy
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 30 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Description:
Writhing ribbons of quasi-real darkness extend from your
hand. As an action, you can make a melee spell attack with
the tendrils against any creature within range. On a hit,
the target takes 2d8 cold damage and must succeed at a
Dexterity saving throw or be restrained.
A creature that starts its turn restrained by the shadow
tendrils takes the cold damage again. It can take an action
to make a Dexterity check against your spell save DC to
free itself. On your turn, as a bonus action, you can drag
a creature restrained by the shadow tendrils up to 15 feet
closer to you.
The tendrils have AC 13 and 12 hit points. They are
immune to bludgeoning damage and to piercing and
slashing damage from nonmagical weapons. They are
vulnerable to radiant damage. If the tendrils are destroyed
by damage but the spell is still in effect, you can re-form
them on your turn as a bonus action.
3rd-level transmutation (ritual) (shadow)
Casting Time: 1 minute
Range: 5 feet
Components: V, S, M (ink made from the blood of
a raven)
Duration: 1 hour
You paint a small door approximately 2 feet square on a
hard surface to create a portal into the void of space. The
portal “peels off ” the surface you painted it on and follows
you when you move, always floating in the air within 5 feet
of you. An icy chill flows out from the portal. You can place
up to 750 pounds of nonliving matter in the portal, where
it stays suspended in the frigid void until you withdraw
it. Items that are still inside the shadow trove when the
duration ends spill out onto the ground. You can designate
a number of creatures up to your Intelligence modifier
who have access to the shadow trove; only you and those
creatures can move objects into the portal.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
spell slot of 4th level or higher, the duration increases by 2
hours for each slot level above 3rd.

You create a shadow play against a screen or wall. The
surface can encompass up to 100 square feet. The number
of creatures that can see the shadow play equals your
Intelligence score. The shadowy figures make no sound
but they can dance, run, move, kiss, fight, and so forth.
Most of the figures are generic types—a rabbit, a dwarf—
but a number of them equal to your Intelligence modifier
can be recognizable as specific individuals.

50 gp)
You momentarily become a shadow (a humanoid-
shaped absence of light, not the undead creature of that
name). You can slide under a door, through a keyhole, or
through any other tiny opening. All of your equipment is
transformed with you, and you can move up to your full
speed during the spell’s duration. While in this form, you
have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made in
darkness or dim light and you are immune to nonmagical
bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. You can
dismiss this spell by using an action to do so.
If you return to your normal form while in a space too
small for you (such as a mouse hole, sewer pipe, or the
like), you take 4d6 force damage and are pushed to the
nearest space within 50 feet big enough to hold you. If the
distance is greater than 50 feet, you take an extra 1d6 force
damage for every additional 10 feet traveled.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target an
additional willing creature that you touch for each slot

Name: UMBRAL STORM
Level: 9
School: Necromancy
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 120 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Description:
You create a channel to a region of the Plane of Shadow
that is inimical to life and order. A storm of dark, raging
entropy fills a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point
you can see within range. Any creature that starts its turn
in the storm or enters it for the first time on its turn takes
6d8 necrotic damage and gains one level of exhaustion; a
successful Constitution saving throw halves the damage
and prevents the exhaustion.
You can use a bonus action on your turn to move the area
of the storm 30 feet in any direction.
Shadow
BloodlineYour magic comes from a place drained of color,
where light fights a losing battle against the relentless
encroachment of darkness.
In the distant past, your ancestors were touched by shadow
magic, and it has left its mark on your family bloodline.
Your magic always acts a bit differently from that of other
casters. Your magical fire burns with a deep purple flame
that sheds little light but casts inky shadows. The influence
of shadow magic can be seen in every manifestation of
your work, whether it takes the form of shadowy bonds
tightening around the target of a hold person spell or the
shadows that swirl like storm clouds inside your dimension
door. When you choose this origin at 1st level, you gain
darkvision out to 60 feet. Within that range, you can see in
magical darkness as if it were dim light.
Also starting at 1st level, you can gaze at one creature
within 60 feet of you and by using a bonus action, you
mark that creature with darkness. The marked creature
has disadvantage on its next attack roll or skill check
involving sight, unless it makes a successful Charisma
saving throw. You can use this feature a number of times
equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1). You
regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
Starting at 6th level, you have advantage on saving throws
against illusion magic. You can also cast blur or mirror
image by spending 2 sorcery points.
At 14th level, you gain the ability to traverse between
patches of darkness. When the area you occupy is lightly
or heavily obscured, you can use a bonus action to step
through a shadow and emerge from another shadow up to
200 feet away. You can stay inside the shadow connection
for a number of rounds equal to your Charisma modifier
(minimum of 1); while there, you are invisible, nothing can
affect you, and you can’t affect anything else. Each use of
this ability costs you 4 sorcery points.
Beginning at 18th level, by spending 4 sorcery points, you
radiate an aura of shadow that causes everything within
15 feet of you to become lightly obscured because of dim
lighting. Any portion of that area that’s already dimly lit
becomes dark instead. An enemy that starts its turn inside
this aura takes 10 necrotic damage and must succeed on
a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened. The effect
lasts until the start of your next turn.
The control and manipulation of time is an esoteric
and mysterious branch of magic. Spellcasters who
seek to alter time have the potential to perform
incredible deeds. That potential is tempered by the
great danger of intervening with time, which resists
mortal interference. Many gods, too, look unfavorably
on those who try to divert or dam the currents of time,
and their disfavor should never be taken lightly.
SPELL LISTSEsoteric though it may be, the knowledge of how to
manipulate time through magic is not the province of
certain types of spellcasters. Anyone, even paladins, can
amass a repertoire of these spells sufficient to attract the
attention of a higher power.
Several temporal spells are also classified as clockwork
magic. For ease of reference, those entries in the lists carry
a “[clockwork]” identifier.

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Description:
You control the currents of time, affecting all creatures
within 30 feet of yourself. You can choose to deliver either
a haste or slow effect (as the spell) to each creature in the
area. An unwilling creature makes a Constitution saving
throw, avoiding the effect on a success. Each unwilling
creature must make a new saving throw if it remains
in the affected area at the end of its turn. Any affected
creature returns to normal if it exits the area, but if a
creature reenters the area while the spell is still active, it
is subject to the effect of the spell (and receives another
saving throw, if unwilling).

In a flash of foreknowledge, you spot an oncoming attack
with enough time to avoid it. Upon casting this spell,
you can move up to half your speed without provoking
opportunity attacks. The oncoming attack still occurs
but misses automatically if you are no longer within the
attack’s range, are in a space that's impossible for the
attack to hit, or can’t be targeted by that attack in your new
position. If none of those circumstances apply but the
situation has changed—you have moved into a position
where you have cover, for example—then the attack is
made after taking the new situation into account.

Range: 30 feet
Components: V
Duration: Instantaneous
Description:
makes an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw
Just in time, you call out a fortunate warning to a creature
within range. The target rolls a d4 and adds the number
rolled to an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw that
it has just made and uses the new result for determining
success or failure.
1st-level transmutation (temporal) (clockwork)
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 minute
You inflict the ravages of aging on up to three creatures
within range, temporarily discomfiting them and making
them appear elderly for a time. Each target must make
a successful Wisdom saving throw, or its walking speed
is halved (round up to the nearest 5-foot increment) and
it has disadvantage on Dexterity checks (but not saving
throws). An affected creature can repeat the saving throw
at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on
a success.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can target one
additional creature for each slot level above 1st.

Name: DECELERATE
Level: 2
School: Transmutation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S, M (a toy top)
Duration: 1 minute
Description:
You slow the flow of time around a creature within range
that you can see. The creature must make a successful
Wisdom saving throw, or its walking speed is halved
(round up to the nearest 5-foot increment). The creature
can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns,
ending the effect on a success. Until the spell ends, on a
failed save the target’s speed is halved again at the start of
each of your turns. For example, if a creature with a speed
of 30 feet fails its initial saving throw, its speed drops to
15 feet. At the start of your next turn, the creature’s speed
drops to 10 feet on a failed save, then to 5 feet on the
following round on another failed save. Decelerate can’t
reduce a creature’s speed to less than 5 feet.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a

Description:
You or a creature that you touch can see a few seconds
into the future. When the spell is cast, each other creature
within 30 feet of the target must make a Wisdom saving
throw. Those that fail must declare, in initiative order,
what their next action will be. The target of the spell
declares his or her action last, after hearing what all other
creatures will do. Each creature that declared an action
must follow its declaration as closely as possible when
its turn comes. For the duration of the spell, the target
has advantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving
throws, and creatures that declared their actions have
disadvantage on attack rolls against the target.

School: Divination
Casting Time: 1 bonus action
Range: Self
Components: S
Duration: Instantaneous
Description:
Thanks to your foreknowledge, you know exactly when
your foe will take his or her eyes off you. Casting this
spell has the same effect as making a successful Dexterity
(Stealth) check, provided cover or concealment is available
within 10 feet of you. It doesn’t matter whether enemies
can see you when you cast the spell; they glance away at
just the right moment. You can move up to 10 feet as part
of casting the spell, provided you’re able to move (not
restrained or grappled or reduced to a speed of less than 10
feet for any other reason). This move doesn’t count as part
of your normal movement. After the spell is cast, you must
be in a position where you can remain hidden: a lightly
obscured space, for example, or a space where you have
total cover. Otherwise, enemies see you again immediately
and you’re not hidden.

Duration: Instantaneous
Description:
You make one living creature or plant within range move
rapidly in time compared to you. The target becomes one
year older. For example, you could cast this spell on a
seedling, which causes the plant to sprout from the soil,
or you could cast this spell on a newly hatched duckling,
causing it to become a full-grown duck. If the target is
a creature with an Intelligence of 3 or higher, it must
succeed on a Constitution saving throw to resist the aging.
It can choose to fail the saving throw.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
spell slot of 5th level or higher, you increase the target’s age
by one additional year for each slot level above 4th.

Description:
You accelerate the aging of one creature within range,
causing it to take on the state of a decrepit version of its
type. The target suffers three levels of exhaustion that
cannot be removed by normal means. A greater restoration
spell partially reverses the effect of this spell, removing one
level of exhaustion. Constructs and undead are unaffected
by this spell, and creatures who live to great age without
negative effects, such as dragons, are also unaffected.

You foresee your foe’s strike a split second before it occurs.
When you cast this spell successfully, you also designate
a number of your allies that can see or hear you equal to
your spellcasting ability modifier + your proficiency bonus.
Those allies are also not surprised by the attack and can act
normally in the first round of combat.
If you would be surprised, you must make a check using
your spellcasting ability at the moment your reaction
would be triggered. The check DC is equal to the current
initiative count. On a failed check, you are surprised and
can’t use your reaction to cast this spell until after your
next turn. On a successful check, you can use your reaction

Name: TIME JAUNT
Level: 7
School: Transmutation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self
Components: V
Duration: Special
Description:
When you cast this spell, you step outside the normal time
stream, seeming to vanish as 1 round of time passes. You
can make minor alterations to the scene being played out,
becoming visible for an instant each time you make an
adjustment that aids an ally or hinders foes. To everyone
else, you disappear when the spell is cast, then flicker into
and out of view during the next round, before reappearing
for good in the space you vanished from 1 round later,
whereupon the spell ends. You cannot be attacked by any
means while under the effect of this spell.
As the round progresses, you can choose to bestow a
single effect on each creature involved in the combat,
choosing from the list below. You cannot take any other
actions during the round.
• Give a creature advantage or disadvantage on a saving
throw it is about to make.
• Give a creature advantage or disadvantage on an attack
roll it is about to make.
• Alter the location of a mobile object to provide or
remove cover for a creature.
• Shift objects into the path of a creature; the first 10 feet
of terrain it must travel becomes difficult terrain.
• After an attack roll is determined to be successful,
adjust the angle of the strike or the positioning of the
target, either causing the strike to deal half as much
damage or providing a bonus to damage equal to half
your level.
Example of Combat. An adventuring party encounters
four trolls in their lair. Initiative is rolled, and the order is
fighter 20, cleric 15, rogue 14, trolls 12, wizard 10. Events
unfold in this way:
Fighter draws sword and attacks troll #1.
Cleric casts time jaunt and disappears.
Rogue fires an arrow at troll #2. Cleric yanks the troll’s
arm, turning it broadside for a better target and giving the
rogue advantage on the attack roll. The attack hits.
Troll #1 swings at the fighter. Cleric gives the fighter’s
shield a nudge to raise it just a little faster. Troll has
disadvantage on the attack roll and misses.
Troll #2 throws a spear at the rogue. Cleric flips a table
over between the rogue and the troll, giving the rogue cover
against the attack. Attack roll is still high enough to hit.
Troll #3 charges the fighter. Cleric tips over an open
barrel of pickled herring, strewing the contents across
the floor and making the first 10 feet in the troll’s path
difficult terrain. As a result, troll #3 does not have enough
movement to reach the fighter on its turn.
Troll #4 moves and attacks the fighter, scoring a hit.
Cleric pulls on the troll’s weapon arm so the strike is a
glancing one rather than a direct hit, and the attack deals
half as much damage.
Wizard casts grease on the area where trolls #1 and #4
are standing. Cleric gives each a swift kick to the back
of the knee. Trolls have disadvantage on their Dexterity
saving throws, fail their saves, and fall prone.
Fighter stabs at troll #1, scoring a hit. Cleric gives the
troll’s arm a yank, moving it just enough that the fighter
hits the monster’s chest rather than its shoulder, providing
the fighter a bonus of +7 (half the cleric’s level) on the
attack’s damage.
Cleric pops back into view, occupying the space where
time jaunt was cast, then takes the next turn in round 2 as
normal.
8th-level transmutation (temporal) (clockwork)
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous
You touch a construct and throw it forward in time if it
fails a Constitution saving throw. The construct disappears
for 1d4 + 1 rounds, during which time it cannot act or be
acted upon in any way. When the construct returns, it is
unaware that any time has passed.

Name: TIME LOOP
Level: 6
School: Transmutation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 30 feet
Components: V, S, M (a metal loop)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Description:
You capture a creature within range in a loop of time.
The target is teleported to the space where it began its
most recent turn. The target then makes a Wisdom saving
throw. On a successful save, the spell ends. On a failed
save, the creature must repeat the activities it undertook
on its previous turn, following the sequence of moves and
actions to the best of its ability. It doesn’t need to move
along the same path or attack the same target, but if it
moved and then attacked on its previous turn, its only
option is to move and then attack on this turn. If the space
where the target began its previous turn is occupied or if
it’s impossible for the target to take the same action (if it
cast a spell but is now unable to do so, for example), the
target becomes incapacitated.
An affected target can repeat the saving throw at the end
of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
For as long as the spell lasts, the target teleports back to its
starting point at the start of each of its turns, and it must
repeat the same sequence of moves and actions.
TIME SLIPth-level enchantment (temporal) (clockwork)
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S, M (the heart of a chaotic creature of
challenge rating 5 or higher, worth 500 gp)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
You ensnare a creature within range in an insidious trap,
causing different parts of its body to function at different
speeds. The creature must make an Intelligence saving
throw. On a failed save, it is stunned until the end of its
next turn. On a success, the creature’s speed is halved
and it has disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws
until the end of its next turn. The creature repeats the
saving throw at the end of each of its turns, with the same
effects for success and failure. In addition, the creature has
disadvantage on Strength or Dexterity saving throws but
advantage on Constitution or Charisma saving throws for
the spell’s duration (a side effect of the chronal anomaly
suffusing its body). The spell ends if the creature makes
three successful saves in a row.

Name: TIME STEP
Level: 2
School: Conjuration
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self
Components: V
Duration: Instantaneous
Description:
You briefly step forward in time. You disappear from your
location and reappear at the start of your next turn in a
location of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of
the space you disappeared from. You can’t be affected by
anything that happens during the time you’re missing,
and you aren’t aware of anything that happens during
that time.

=== SPELL START ===
Name: TIME VORTEX
Level: 4
School: Evocation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 90 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Description:
This spell destabilizes the flow of time, enabling you to
create a vortex of temporal fluctuations that are visible
as a spherical distortion with a 10-foot radius, centered
on a point within range. Each creature in the area when
you cast the spell must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw
or be affected by the time vortex. While the spell lasts, a
creature that enters the sphere or starts its turn inside the
sphere must also succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be
affected. On a succesful save, it becomes immune to this
casting of the spell.
An affected creature can’t take reactions and rolls a d10 at
the start of its turn to determine its behavior for that turn.
D
1–2 The creature is affected as if by a slow spell until the
start of its next turn.
3–5 The creature is stunned until the start of its next turn.
6–8 The creature’s current initiative result is reduced by
5. The creature begins using this new initiative result
in the next round. Multiple occurrences of this effect
for the same creature are cumulative.
9–10 The creature’s speed is halved (round up to the nearest
5-foot increment) until the start of its next turn.
You can move the temporal vortex 10 feet each round as
a bonus action. An affected creature can repeat the saving
throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on
itself on a success.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell
slot of 5th level or higher, the radius of the sphere increases
by 5 feet for each slot level above 4th.

Name: WALL OF TIME
Level: 5
School: Abjuration
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 120 feet
Components: V, S, M (an hourglass)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Description:
You create a wall of shimmering, transparent blocks on
a solid surface within range. You can make a straight
wall up to 60 feet long, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick, or
a cylindrical wall up to 20 feet high, 1 foot thick, and 20
feet in diameter. Nonmagical ranged attacks that cross
the wall vanish into the time stream with no other effect.
Ranged spell attacks and ranged weapon attacks made with
magic weapons that pass through the wall are made with
disadvantage. A creature that intentionally enters or passes
through the wall is affected as if it had just failed its initial
saving throw against a slow spell.
For those who understand its secrets, the flow of time
itself is a powerful source of magical power.
Wizards who strive to master temporal magic view seconds
and minutes not merely as a way to measure life span, but
as a way of manifesting great and mysterious power.
How to Start: If you’re a wizard who wants to become
a timekeeper, you make that decision upon reaching
2nd level, when you are also entitled to choose an
arcane tradition. If you decide to follow the path of the
timekeeper exclusively, you can forego the selection of an
arcane tradition and gain the features of the timekeeper
specialty instead.
You can also pursue the timekeeper specialty in
conjunction with one of the standard arcane traditions.
If you choose to do this, you gain the Savant feature of
your chosen school in addition to Temporal Magic Savant
(described below). Also at 2nd level, you choose whether
to gain the Temporal Points feature (see below) or the
2nd-level feature of your chosen school. Thereafter, at 6th,
10th, and 14th level, you choose between the lowest-level
features still available. For instance, an abjurer might
select Arcane Ward at 2nd level and Temporal Points at
6th level, followed by either Projected Ward or Extended
Magic at 10th level.
Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the
gold and time you must spend to copy a temporal spell
into your spellbook is halved.
Starting at 2nd level, you gain access to temporal points,
which you can spend to acquire benefits. You receive 2
temporal points at 2nd level, and you gain 1 additional
point every time you gain a level, to a maximum of 20
points at 20th level. You regain all spent temporal points
when you finish a long rest.
You can spend 1 temporal point as a reaction or a bonus
action on your turn to gain one of the following effects for
1 round:
• You can use a bonus action on your next turn to take
the Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object action.
• Your Armor Class increases by 2.
• You have advantage on the next Dexterity check you
make.
Optionally, you can spend 2 temporal points as a bonus
action on your turn to grant a creature you touch one of
the listed effects for 1 round.
Beginning at 6th level, when you cast a spell whose
duration is 1 minute or longer, you can spend 1 temporal
point to double the spell’s duration, to a maximum of
24 hours.
At 10th level, you add the haste spell to your spellbook, if
you don’t have it already. From now on, you never suffer
the negative aftereffects of the haste spell and can act
normally when the spell ends.
Also, you can cast haste on yourself without expending a
spell slot. Once you cast haste in this way, you can’t do so
again until you finish a short or long rest. You can still
cast it normally using an available spell slot.
Starting at 14th level, you can choose to ignore the
effect of a temporal spell that would otherwise affect
you. For instance, you can exempt yourself from the
effect of a slow spell cast in the area you occupy. Or,
if you would be affected by a quick time spell, you can
choose to automatically succeed on the saving throw.
Also, you can spend temporal points in the
following ways.
• When you cast a spell with a casting time
of 1 action, you can spend 2 temporal
points to change the casting time for
this casting to 1 bonus action.
• When you must make a saving
throw against a temporal spell,
you can spend 2 temporal points
to succeed on the saving throw
automatically. You can make the
decision to spend the points after
rolling the d20 and seeing the result.
• As a reaction when another creature casts time stop,
you can spend 5 temporal points to gain the ability
to act during the spell’s duration. You and the spell’s
caster alternate taking turns, with the caster acting
first. You have the same restrictions as the caster. If the
caster ends the spell, it ends for everyone; if you take
an action that ends the spell, it ends only for you, not
for the caster.
Winter has considerable power, regardless of how it
presents itself. In its most obvious manifestation, it
is snow and ice driven by howling wind that reduces
visibility to zero and covers everything in a frozen
shell. Just as dangerous as this overt display of power is
winter’s deceptively beautiful form, when an ineffective
sun shines brightly on a serene tableau of glistening trees
and smooth, powder-coated landscapes. Those who
travel unprepared through this misleading peacefulness
are liable to end up blinded or frozen.

DescriptionsThe following spells are presented in alphabetical order.
=== SPELL END ===

=== SPELL START ===
Name: BITING ARROW
Level: cantrip
School: Evocation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self
Components: V, M (an arrow or a thrown weapon)
Duration: 1 round
Description:
As part of the action used to cast this spell, you make
a ranged weapon attack with a bow, a crossbow, or a
thrown weapon. The effect is limited to a range of 120 feet
despite the weapon’s range, and the attack is made with
disadvantage if the target is in the weapon’s long range.
If the weapon attack hits, it deals damage as usual. In
addition, the target becomes coated in thin frost until the
start of your next turn. If the target uses its reaction before
the start of your next turn, it immediately takes 1d6 cold
damage and the spell ends.
The spell’s damage, for both the ranged attack and the
cold damage, increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level
(+1d6 and 2d6), 11th level (+2d6 and 3d6), and 17th level
(+3d6 and 4d6).

Name: BLIZZARD
Level: 7
School: Conjuration
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 100 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Description:
A howling storm of thick snow and ice crystals appears
in a cylinder 40 feet high and 40 feet in diameter within
range. The area is heavily obscured by the swirling snow.
When the storm appears, each creature in the area takes
8d8 cold damage, or half as much damage with a successful
Constitution saving throw. A creature also makes this
saving throw and takes damage when it enters the area for
the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. In addition,
a creature that takes cold damage from this spell has
disadvantage on Constitution saving throws to maintain
concentration until the start of its next turn.
BOREAS’S BREATH
2nd-level transmutation (ritual) (winter)
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous
You freeze standing water in a 20-foot cube or running
water in a 10-foot cube centered on you. The water turns
to solid ice. The surface becomes difficult terrain, and
any creature that ends its turn on the ice must make a
successful DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall prone.
Creatures that are partially submerged in the water when
it freezes become restrained. While restrained in this way,
a creature takes 1d6 cold damage at the end of its turn.
It can break free by using an action to make a successful
Strength check against your spell save DC.
Creatures that are fully submerged in the water when it
freezes become incapacitated and cannot breathe. While
incapacitated in this way, a creature takes 2d6 cold damage
at the end of its turn. A trapped creature makes a DC 20
Strength saving throw after taking this damage at the end
of its turn, breaking free from the ice on a success.
The ice has AC 10 and 15 hit points. It is vulnerable to
fire damage, has resistance to nonmagical slashing and
piercing damage, and is immune to cold, necrotic, poison,
psychic, and thunder damage.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell
slot of 3rd level or higher, the size of the cube increases by
10 feet for each slot level above 2nd.

Name: BREATHTAKING WIND
Level: 1
School: Evocation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 30 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Description:
You target a creature with a blast of wintry air. That
creature must make a successful Constitution saving
throw or become unable to speak or cast spells with a vocal
component for the duration of the spell.
=== SPELL END ===

=== SPELL START ===
Name: BRITTLING
Level: 4
School: Transmutation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M (an icicle)
Duration: Instantaneous
Description:
This spell uses biting cold to make a metal or stone object
you touch become brittle and more easily shattered. The
object’s hit points are reduced by a number equal to your
level as a spellcaster, and Strength checks to shatter or
break the object are made with advantage if they occur
within 1 minute of the spell’s casting. If the object isn’t
shattered during this time, it reverts to the state it was in
before the spell was cast.
=== SPELL END ===

=== SPELL START ===
Name: CLASH OF GLACIERS
Level: 5
School: Evocation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self (100-foot line)
Components: V, S, M (a piece of cracked glass)
Duration: Instantaneous
Description:
You conjure up icy boulders that crush creatures in a
line 100 feet long. Each creature in the area takes 5d6
bludgeoning damage plus 5d6 cold damage, or half the
damage with a successful Dexterity saving throw.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage increases by
1d6 for each slot level above 5th. You decide whether each
extra die deals bludgeoning or cold damage.
=== SPELL END ===

=== SPELL START ===
Name: CONTROL ICE
Level: 5
School: Transmutation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 300 feet
Components: V, S, M (a cube of white wax)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Description:
Until the spell ends, you control any ice inside an area you
choose within range that can be as large as a cube 100 feet
on a side. You choose one of the following three effects
when you cast this spell. As an action on each of your
turns thereafter, you can use the same effect or choose
a different one. Any alterations made to the ice remain
after the spell ends, but can be altered by other effects
(temperature, seismic action, or another application of
this spell, for example).
Crack. You cause ice in the area to crack and splinter.
On level terrain, this effect turns the ice into difficult
terrain, possibly producing other hazards, depending
on the terrain and the nature of the ice—ice over a deep
chasm might open onto a pit, while ice over water can
break into individual floes, for example. Using this effect
on cliffs, walls, or ceilings made of ice can cause collapse,
dealing 4d10 bludgeoning damage to creatures in the area
below the collapse, or half the damage with a successful
Dexterity saving throw. After such a collapse, the area
where the fallen ice collects becomes difficult terrain.
Reshape. You cause ice in a portion of the area to
rapidly melt, move, and re-form into whatever shape
you command. You can block holes, open tunnels, form
bridges, remove difficult terrain, or otherwise alter the
form of the ice in the area. You can cause ice to become
slippery, making it difficult terrain, or dry to remove
difficult terrain. You can fill a hole up to a 20-foot cube,
or create 20 feet (up to 20 feet wide) of a bridge across a
chasm, or raise a 20-foot-tall pillar of ice (up to 20 feet
square). You can continue this action on consecutive
rounds to increase the size of the affected area while you
maintain concentration on the spell.
Thicken/Thin. You cause existing ice to increase or
decrease in thickness, up to 1 inch per round over some or
all of the total area, either making the surface stronger or
creating thin ice that is hazardous to walk on.
=== SPELL END ===

=== SPELL START ===
Name: CREEPING ICE
Level: 2
School: Conjuration
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Description:
You create a sheet of ice that covers a 5-foot square within
range and lasts for the spell’s duration. The iced area is
difficult terrain.
A creature in the area where you cast the spell must make
a successful Strength saving throw or be restrained by ice
that rapidly encases it. A creature restrained by the ice
takes 2d6 cold damage at the start of its turn. A restrained
creature can use an action to make a Strength check
against your spell save DC, freeing itself on a success, but
it has disadvantage on this check. The creature can also be
freed (and the spell ended) by dealing at least 20 damage to
the ice. The restrained creature takes half the damage from
any attacks against the ice.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
spell slot of 4th to 6th level, the area increases to a 10-foot
square, the ice deals 4d6 cold damage, and 40 damage is
needed to melt each 5-foot square. When you cast this spell
using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the area increases
to a 20-foot square, the ice deals 6d6 cold damage, and 60
damage is needed to melt each 5-foot square.
=== SPELL END ===

=== SPELL START ===
Name: CURSE OF BOREAS
Level: 6
School: Transmutation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 100 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Permanent
Description:
You designate a creature within range that you can see.
If the target fails a Charisma saving throw, it and its
equipment are frozen solid, becoming an inert statue of
ice. The creature is effectively paralyzed, but mental activity
does not cease, and signs of life are detectable; the creature
still breathes and its heart continues to beat, though both
acts are almost imperceptible. If the ice statue is broken
or damaged while frozen, the creature will have matching
damage or injury when returned to its original state. Dispel
magic can’t end this spell, but it can allow the target to
speak (but not move or cast spells) for a number of rounds
equal to the spell slot used. Greater restoration or more
potent magic is needed to free a creature from the ice.
=== SPELL END ===

=== SPELL START ===
Name: DEEP FREEZE
Level: 4
School: Evocation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S, M (a piece of ice or quartz)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Description:
You send a blast of deep cold at a creature, dealing 4d8
cold damage to it and encasing it in ice. An encased
creature is grappled and takes an extra 2d8 cold damage
at the start of its turn every round it remains encased. If
the target of this spell makes a successful Dexterity saving
throw, it takes half the damage and none of the extra
damage and is not encased in ice, but the ice that clings to
its body reduces its speed by 15 feet (to a minimum speed
of 5 feet) until it takes an action to remove the ice.
A grappled target can take an action to make a Strength
check against your spell save DC, breaking free of the ice
on a success. Alternatively, another creature within 5 feet
of the target can make a Strength check on its turn, freeing
the creature on a success. The ice can also be attacked. It
has AC 12, 10 hit points, and vulnerability to fire damage.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can target one
additional creature for each slot level above 4th.
=== SPELL END ===

=== SPELL START ===
Name: ENTOMB IN ICE
Level: 2
School: Evocation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Description:
You trap a creature in a thick coating of ice. The target
must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be restrained
for the duration. At the beginning of the trapped
creature’s turn, it takes 2d4 cold damage. On its turn,
an entombed creature (or an ally) can take an action to
make a Strength check against your spell save DC. On a
success, the entombed creature is freed. The icy tomb is
also susceptible to damage and vulnerable to fire. Damage
equal to your spell save DC will destroy the tomb and free
the target.
At Higher Levels.
When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can target one
additional creature for each slot level above 3rd. The
creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when you
target them.
=== SPELL END ===

=== SPELL START ===
Name: EVERCOLD
Level: 4
School: Necromancy
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 30 feet
Components: V, S, M (an insect that froze to death)
Duration: Until dispelled
Description:
You target a creature within the spell’s range, and that
creature must make a successful Wisdom saving throw
or take 1d6 cold damage. In addition, the target is cursed
to feel as if it’s exposed to extreme cold. For the duration
of evercold, the target must make a successful DC 10
Constitution saving throw at the end of each hour or gain
one level of exhaustion. The target has advantage on the
hourly saving throws if wearing suitable cold-weather
clothing, but it has disadvantage on saving throws against
other spells and magic that deal cold damage (regardless of
its clothing) for the spell’s duration.
The spell can be ended by its caster or by dispel magic or
remove curse.

=== SPELL START ===
Name: FLURRY
Level: 1
School: Transmutation
Casting Time: 1 bonus action
Range: Self
Components: V, S, M (a fleck of quartz)
Duration: 1 round
Description:
A flurry of snow surrounds you and extends to a 5-foot
radius around you. While it lasts, anyone trying to see into,
out of, or through the affected area (including you) has
disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks and attack
rolls.
=== SPELL END ===

=== SPELL START ===
Name: FREEZE BLOOD
Level: 3
School: Transmutation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Description:
When you cast freeze blood as a successful melee spell
attack against a living creature with a circulatory system,
the creature’s blood freezes. For the spell’s duration, the
affected creature’s speed is halved and it takes 2d6 cold
damage at the start of each of its turns. If the creature
takes bludgeoning damage from a critical hit, the attack’s
damage dice are rolled three times instead of twice.
At the end of each of its turns, the creature can make a
Constitution saving throw, ending the effect on a success.
=== SPELL END ===

Name: FREEZE POTION
Level: 1
School: Transmutation
Casting Time: 1 reaction, which you take when you see a
Range: 25 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous
Description:
creature within range about to consume a liquid
A blue spark flies from your hand and strikes a potion vial,
drinking horn, waterskin, or similar container, instantly
freezing the contents. The substance melts normally

or glass that is consumed in the casting)
A gleaming fortress of ice springs from a square area of
ground that you can see within range. It is a 10-foot cube
(including floor and roof). The fortress can’t overlap
any other structures, but any creatures in its space are
harmlessly lifted up as the ice rises into position. The walls
are made of ice (AC 13), have 120 hit points each, and are
immune to cold, necrotic, poison, and psychic damage.
Reducing a wall to 0 hit points destroys it and has a 50
percent chance to cause the roof to collapse. A damaged
wall can be repaired by casting a spell that deals cold
damage on it, on a point-for-point basis.
Each wall has two arrow slits. One wall also includes
an ice door with an arcane lock. You designate at the
time of the fort’s creation which creatures can enter the
fortification. The door has AC 18 and 60 hit points, or
it can be broken open with a successful DC 25 Strength
(Athletics) check (DC 15 if the arcane lock is dispelled).
The fortress catches and reflects light, so that creatures
outside the fortress who rely on sight have disadvantage
on Perception checks and attack rolls made against those
within the fortress if it’s in an area of bright sunlight.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using

When you cast protective ice, you encase a willing target in
icy, medium armor equivalent to a breastplate (AC 14). A
creature without the appropriate armor proficiency has
the usual penalties. If the target is already wearing armor,
it only uses the better of the two armor classes.
A creature striking a target encased in protective ice with a
melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 1d6 cold damage.
If the armor’s wearer takes fire damage, an equal amount
of damage is done to the armor, which has 30 hit points
and is damaged only when its wearer takes fire damage.
Damaged ice can be repaired by casting a spell that deals
cold damage on it, on a point-for-point basis, but the
armor can’t have more than 30 points repaired.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
4th-level spell slot, it creates splint armor (AC 17, 40 hit

points increase by 10 for each spell slot above 5th, but the

Sculptures created by this spell can be animated with
animate objects or comparable magic. Animated sculptures
gain the AC, hit points, and other attributes provided by
that spell. When they attack, they deal normal damage plus
a similar amount of cold damage; an animated Medium

Description:
You transform one of the four elements—air, earth, fire, or
water—into ice or snow. The affected area is a sphere with
a radius of 100 feet, centered on you. The specific effect
depends on the element you choose.
Air. Vapor condenses into snowfall. If the effect of a fog
cloud spell, a stinking cloud, or similar magic is in the area,
this spell negates it. A creature of elemental air within
range takes 8d6 cold damage—and, if airborne, it must
make a successful Constitution saving throw at the start of
its turn to avoid being knocked prone (no falling damage).
Earth. Soil freezes into permafrost to a depth of 10 feet.
A creature burrowing through the area has its speed halved
until the area thaws, unless it can burrow through solid
rock. A creature of elemental earth within range must
make a successful Constitution saving throw or take 8d6
cold damage.
Fire. Flames or other sources of extreme heat (such as
molten lava) on the ground within range transform into
shards of ice, and the area they occupy becomes difficult
terrain. Each creature in the previously burning area
takes 2d6 slashing damage when the spell is cast and
1d6 slashing damage for every 5 feet it moves in the area
(unless it is not hindered by icy terrain) until the spell ends;
a successful Dexterity saving throw reduces the slashing
damage by half. A creature of elemental fire within range
must make a successful Constitution saving throw or take
8d6 cold damage and be stunned for 1d6 rounds.
Water. Open water (a pond, lake, or river) freezes to
a depth of 4 feet. A creature on the surface of the water
when it freezes must make a successful Dexterity saving
throw to avoid being trapped in the ice. A trapped creature
can free itself by using an action to make a successful
Strength (Athletics) check. A creature of elemental
water within range takes no damage from the spell but
is paralyzed for 1d6 rounds unless it makes a successful
Constitution saving throw, and it treats the affected area

Upon casting wintry glide, you can travel via ice or snow

This is typically a powerful entity of winter, such as the
avatar of Boreas (Tome of Beasts, p. 42), but prominent
ice maidens (Tome of Beasts, p. 254), ice devils, and other
creatures associated with the cold can also serve as patrons.
Your patron seeks to immerse the world in eternal winter
or bring about some similar fate. Though you might not
share this goal, you have sworn fealty to this being, and
you act as its agent to spread winter wherever you roam.

are added to the warlock spell list for you.

3rd protective ice*, sleet storm
4th ice storm, wintry glide*
5th cone of cold, ice fortress*
* Described in this book
Starting at 1st level, you can bring a small chunk of ice to
your aid. As a reaction when a creature makes a weapon
attack against you, the ice shields you from the attack. The
creature has disadvantage on its attack roll. Regardless
of the result of the attack, the ice melts away immediately
afterward. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again
until you finish a short or long rest.
Beginning at 6th level, as part of your move, you can
leave a layer of ice on the ground along your path. This
ice persists for 1 minute. A creature other than you that
enters a space of ice must make a successful Dexterity
saving throw against your spell save DC or fall prone in
that space. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again
until you finish a short or long rest.
Beginning at 10th level, your skin takes on an icy sheen.
You are immune to cold damage, and you have advantage
on Strength and Dexterity checks you make to escape
from being grappled.
At 3rd level, the Frozen One bestows a gift upon you for
your loyal service. You gain one of the following features of
your choice.
Pact of the Blade. Your pact weapon has a patina of
ice, and small icicles dangle from it. When you create or
summon your pact weapon, you can choose whether it
deals its standard damage type or cold damage.
Pact of the Chain. When you conjure your familiar
or change its form, you can choose the form of an ice
mephit in addition to the usual options granted by the pact
boon. When you use your action to command your mephit
familiar to attack, it can use its breath or cast an innate
spell instead.
Pact of the Tome. Your book is formed from rune-
etched sheets of ice that are cold to the touch to everyone
but you. The book is immune to cold damage.
The following invocations are available to Frozen One
warlocks.
Prerequisite: 3rd level, Frozen One patron
Ice and snow cascade around you. When you use an action,
your melee attacks deal an extra 1d6 cold damage, and
attackers within 5 feet of you who hit you in melee take 1d6
cold damage, for as long as you maintain concentration.
Prerequisite: 5th level, Frozen One patron
You can cast sculpt snow once using a warlock spell slot.
Creatures that see your sculpture for the first time must
make a successful Wisdom saving throw against your
spell save DC or become frightened of the sculpture for
1 round. You must finish a long rest before using this
invocation again.
Your innate magic comes from the power of divine or
magical entities of winter, beings born to the ice and cold.
You might trace your descent down a line of ancestry
from a mighty sorcerer that bargained with the God of
the North Wind for power, or that formed a pact with
powerful creatures of ice and snow. Or perhaps you are
the first of the bloodline, the product of a union between
a parent of your own kind and some wintry being. You
Starting at 14th level, you can designate a creature you see
within 60 feet of you. It must make a Constitution saving
throw against your warlock spell save DC. On a failed save,
the creature feels numbing cold emanating from your
patron. The creature takes 10d10 cold damage and must
make another Constitution saving throw. If the second
saving throw is failed, the creature is also restrained for
1 minute. A creature restrained in this way repeats the
saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the
condition on a success. After using this feature, you must
finish a short or long rest before using it again.
might even be the originator of it—the first one to traffic
with a powerful boreal being in order to master the icy
might of winter magic.
Starting when you choose this origin at 1st level, your
affinity for winter means that your enemies suffer more
than normal from the cold spells you cast. A creature that
takes cold damage from one of your spells takes extra
damage equal to your Charisma modifier.
WINTER'S CHILD
Your affinity with winter allows you to venture forth in
the cold without harm. You never suffer the effects of
extreme cold, even if you are not dressed for the weather.
Additionally, you can move over snow and ice without
taking penalties for difficult terrain.
At 6th level, you gain resistance to cold damage. Also,
when you use sorcery points to apply a Metamagic option
to a spell that deals cold damage or that produces an effect
that involves snow or ice (sleet storm, for example), you can
reduce the cost by 1 sorcery point, to a minimum of 1 point.
WINTER'S FORM
At 14th level, you can give your wintry power physical
form. As a bonus action, you can spend 1 sorcery point
to transform your body for 1 minute. When you use this
feature, you can take one of two forms:
• Your body transforms into a swirling mass of sleet
or snow. Your gear transforms with you or falls to
the ground in the space you occupy, as you choose.
While in this form, you cannot speak, manipulate
objects, attack, or cast spells. You gain immunity to
cold damage, resistance to nonmagical bludgeoning,
piercing, and slashing damage, and vulnerability
to fire damage. In this form, your only method
of movement is a flying speed of 60 feet, and you
can hover. You can pass through small holes and
narrow openings at least 1 inch in width, but you treat
liquids as if they were solid surfaces. You cannot fall,
and you remain hovering even while stunned or
incapacitated. You can enter the space of another
creature and remain there. Any creature whose
space you occupy takes cold damage equal to your
Charisma modifier.
• Your body transforms into translucent, blue-white
ice, and your hair becomes a crown of snow. You gain
immunity to cold damage, resistance to nonmagical
bludgeoning damage, and vulnerability to fire damage,
and your Armor Class is never lower than 15 + your
Dexterity modifier. Any creature within 5 feet of you
that hits you with a melee weapon attack or a touch
attack takes cold damage equal to your Charisma
modifier. While in this form, you gain a slam attack
with your icy fists that deals 1d4 bludgeoning damage
plus cold damage equal to your Charisma modifier.
WINTER'S SOUL
At 18th level, you gain immunity to cold damage and
resistance to fire damage. (You don’t have this resistance
when you use Winter’s Form, but you also no longer gain
vulnerability to fire damage when you use that feature.)
When you cast a spell that deals cold damage, any creature
that gets a failure on its saving throw against the spell
is also encased in ice, becoming grappled until it or a
creature allied with it within 5 feet succeeds on a Strength
check against your spell save DC. If the spell does not
normally allow a saving throw, the creature makes a saving
throw to avoid being grappled. If the spell already causes
the grappled condition, the creature has disadvantage on
the saving throw.
280WIZARD'S ENTOURAGE
The brooding archmage alone in his tower is a staple of
fantasy literature. The more powerful the wizard becomes,
the more distant he or she seems from the common folk,
and the greatest wizards are often the most misunderstood
or feared. Some wizards try to alleviate this loneliness
by passing on their knowledge to those around them,
taking on one or more apprentices. Others create magic
constructs to guard their homes—or simply to keep them
company—and wizards summon familiars for much the
same reason.
This section describes various companions and
accoutrements that a powerful spellcaster, particularly a
wizard, might have. These creatures and features help to
flesh out a wizard’s home and are often encountered in
the wizard’s stead. Finally, they provide opportunities for
adventure, either independent of the wizard or linked to
the spellcaster.
ApprenticesEvery archmage needs someone to clean dishes, tend to
meals, and wash bedpans. Although some wizards use
spells or servants to perform these duties, others give
these jobs to their apprentices, budding wizards they
have taken under their wings to learn the esteemed art of
magic. Many wizards also rely on their apprentices to deal
with the riffraff who wander into their towers looking for
help; for many player characters, the wizard’s apprentice is
their first point of contact.
Wizard's Entourage
281WIZARD'S ENTOURAGE
Below are presented five apprentices that can be inserted
into a new or ongoing campaign. These apprentices are
more than just collections of numbers; each has his or her
own history and motivations that can impact the lives of
the characters who deal with them.
“Magic never judges you based on your appearance. It doesn’t care
if you are fat or thin, if you are beautiful or ugly. Magic accepts
you the way you are.”
Lereilel Cloudwood (NG female human 2nd-level
wizard) is a young woman in her early twenties with
dark reddish-brown hair, pale green eyes, and numerous
freckles. Overweight and lacking confidence, Lereilel
has always been anxious about her appearance and is
frequently tongue-tied, particularly when dealing with
members of the opposite sex. She has a real passion for
magic, however, and was taken in as an apprentice by
Ravin Wyrdstone (LN male human 16th-level wizard
[transmuter]), who has great faith in Lereilel’s abilities.
Background. Lereilel was born into an affluent family
and displayed an affinity for magic when she came of
age—much to the chagrin of her socialite mother, who
constantly expressed her disappointment that Lereilel
had taken after her father’s looks and whims. Although
she was discouraged by her mother’s disapproval and the
mirthful stares of the men her mother brought to woo her,
Lereilel eventually convinced her father to let her study
magic under the tutelage of Ravin Wyrdstone. Since then,
Lereilel has worked hard to prove herself but still thinks
that her appearance holds her back. She has faith that the
transmutation magic she is studying might hold the key
to “correcting” her unsightly looks and finally make her
mother proud of her.
Recently, Lereilel has been seeing Thaliydor Brightcrest,
a handsome half-elf and a local carpenter who seems
to think the world of her despite her homeliness.
Unfortunately for her, Lereilel does not realize she is being
duped and that Thaliydor is actually an assassin (CE male
half-elf 5th-level rogue) who is using her to get closer to
her master.
Personality. Loreilel is highly intelligent and well
versed in arcane lore, but finds it difficult to speak with
people and has been something of a wallflower throughout
her life. As such, she can easily be taken advantage of
by someone who gives her any attention, particularly if
that person is both attractive and charming. If Lereilel
realizes that Thaliydor’s feelings are false, the last shreds
of her confidence might finally break, leading her to do
something potentially self-destructive unless someone
steps in to save her.
Plot Hook. One easy way for the characters to become
involved with Lereilel is to have them hired by her master
as guards. Ravin is concerned that he might be the target
of an assassination attempt by an old enemy and wants the
characters to protect him and his apprentice until he can
track down the villain. Strangely, the archmage is more
concerned about Lereilel than he is about himself and
tells the characters to watch her carefully. Alternatively,
they could be hired by Lereilel’s father to check on his
daughter and see how she is doing. Regardless of how
the characters become involved, their arrival puts a major
chink in Thaliydor’s plans and forces the assassin’s hand,
as the half-elf hires a band of evil brigands to deal with
the characters while he uses Lereilel as bait to make an
attempt on the life of her master.
282WIZARD'S ENTOURAGE
“Ever since my sister was forced to marry that horrible noble, I’ve
been looking for a way to free her. You lot might be just the heroes
I need.”
Terindor Grayveil (CG male human 1st-level wizard) is a
wiry lad of fifteen with unruly orange hair and deep blue
eyes. An earnest and helpful soul, Terindor is also far
smarter than most of the adults around him and has taken
to the study of magic with natural aplomb. His master is
Elgretta Mathelzor (LG female human 14th-level wizard
[evoker]), a famous war wizard who is often away on
military campaigns, leaving Terindor to fend for himself.
Background. Terindor was born to hard-working but
luckless mercantile parents who gave everything they had
to make the lives of their children better, even teaching
them letters and history to help them establish themselves
in the world. The family became crippled by debt, and
rather than seeing her parents cast out onto the streets,
Terindor’s sister, Ileena, agreed to marry a lecherous noble
in order to save the family business. Shortly thereafter,
Terindor sought out the war wizard and begged to become
her apprentice—a move that
shocked his mother and father,
even more so when Elgretta
agreed. Since then, Terindor
has worked hard at his training,
moving forward in leaps and
bounds even though his master
is frequently absent.
Personality.
Terindor is a
determined lad who
consistently pushes
himself to become
a better wizard.
While maintaining this
focus, he frequently pauses
his studies to help out those
in need, whether by fixing
the roof of a spinster’s
cottage or driving out giant
rats from the local brewery.
Well-liked by those in his
community, he is also the
only one not awestruck by his
mistress, who is renowned
for her success in single-
handedly destroying a
horde of goblins and felling
a mighty white dragon with
a barrage of spells.
Terindor’s main reason for wanting to become stronger
is to free Ileena from her forced marriage. Although he
knows that Elgretta sympathizes with him, she has told
him quite bluntly that seeking retribution against the
noble is wrong and not something she can be part of.
Plot Hook. While he is training, Terindor keeps his
ear to the ground in the community for talk of passing
adventurers, particularly those who don’t care about
breaking the rules but are still fundamentally good at
heart. If he hears of the characters’ deeds, he approaches
them at his first opportunity and expresses his desire
to help his sister out of her predicament. Terindor has
nothing to give the characters in payment but promises
to help them enchant their gear when he becomes a more
powerful wizard. If the characters seem about to refuse
his request, he offers them the services of Elgretta—a
promise that he knows might cause him a lot of trouble in
the future.
“Master Taramind took me on as his apprentice even though there
were more suitable candidates. I’ll be forever grateful to him.”
Erolimar (LG male elf 1st-level wizard) is a young elf with
sweeping silvery locks and amethyst eyes. Stout of limb,
graceful and handsome, Erolimar seems almost like the
perfect elf—yet despite these qualities, he has been cursed
with only middling intelligence and wisdom, making
him a poor choice as a wizard’s apprentice. Nevertheless,
he has been taken on by Taramind the Scorched (NE elf
male 15th-level wizard [conjurer]), a mysterious elf with
hideously burned features who is known for his dealings
with elementals and fiends.
Background. Erolimar comes from a long line of
accomplished spellcasters. Indeed, it was expected that
young Erolimar would enroll at an esteemed college
of magic when he came of age so he could follow in his
forebears’ footsteps. This would have been the case, had
he passed the entrance exam. Soon, it became clear that
Erolimar was not the paragon of wizardry his father and
mother thought he would be. Dejected, he turned his back
on magic to pursue the meaningful but far less prestigious
role of hunter for his village.
Just when it seemed that magic had left Erolimar
behind, he was saved by Taramind, who approached
the young elf to be his apprentice. At first fearful of the
wizard’s reputation, Erolimar finally accepted the offer
and has taken to his new position with gusto, unaware
that his master has taken him on to prepare Erolimar’s
soul for sacrifice to a fiend, whose life force he will then
transfer into the young elf ’s body.
283WIZARD'S ENTOURAGE
Personality. Erolimar
is a kind-hearted,
generous, and naive
individual who does
not see a bad bone
in anyone around
him. Even Taramind,
with his menacing
demeanor and harsh
teaching methods, does
not set off Erolimar’s
alarm bells; he prefers
to focus on his master’s
strengths, rather than
than worry about his flaws.
Erolimar is envied by many
in his village for his good
looks and natural agility,
but they are also aware of his
failings, and there are few who can hold a bad thought in
their hearts for the elf for too long.
Plot Hook. The characters are hired by the local elf
population to investigate a spate of bizarre animal attacks
in the vicinity of Taramind’s mansion. The attacks have
been violent and erratic, the animals in question extremely
vicious and difficult to kill. During their investigation,
the characters run into Erolimar, and the elf proves to be
helpful on more than one occasion. Eventually (perhaps
with Erolimar’s help), they realize that the animals have
become possessed by lesser fiends and that some sort of
conjuration magic is responsible. It is at this point when
Taramind begins to prepare the young elf for sacrifice, and
it is up to the characters to save him. How this plays out is
up to the GM, but Taramind is no pushover—his mansion
is home to magic traps, bound fiends, and terrible golems.
“I was a warrior before I became a wizard, a sword for hire who
traveled the world looking for adventure. I made a name for
myself as well. Perhaps you’ve heard of me? Arn’s the name—Arn
of Rowan.”
Arn of Rowan (CN male human 12th-level
fighter/2nd-level wizard) is a strapping man in his
mid-thirties with long brown hair, a thick beard, and
piercing black eyes. Tall and full of vigor, Arn seems like
an odd choice for a wizard’s apprentice, and his master,
Jainara Meadowwands (LN female human 9th-level
wizard [illusionist]), seems more like a harried wife than
a teacher. Indeed, most people find
their pairing to be odd, especially
given that Arn is much more
famous than his master.
284WIZARD'S ENTOURAGE
Background. Arn began his career as a soldier in the
army of a self-righteous duke who waged war against his
neighbors under the pretense of dispensing justice. It was
during this bloody time that Arn solidified his reputation as
a vicious fighter with axe and shield, and once the duke had
his fill of warfare, Arn forged his own career as a mercenary
for hire, basing himself in the small town of Rowan, which
he soon put on the map with his legendary exploits.
It was after one particularly harrowing mission that Arn
drank too much ale at the local tavern and lost a bet to one
of his companions, a bard who claimed that Arn could
never master any trade but that of the blade. Haughtily,
Arn took up the challenge and availed himself of the
talents of Jainara Meadowwands, a mousy-haired woman
and capable illusionist, agreeing to pay off her debts in
exchange for becoming her pupil. Jainara accepted the
deal, believing that Arn would quickly grow bored and
leave—but much to her amazement, he not only stayed but
quickly excelled as her student.
Personality. Arn is a boisterous and carefree individual
who has many scars and tales from his past. Naturally
charismatic and with an unusually keen intellect, he would
probably have been a lord by now if it were not for his
chaotic nature. The fact that he is good at magecraft does
not surprise Arn, since he is good at whatever he puts
his mind to. What does surprise him, however, is that he
actually enjoys the work. He has also grown quite fond of
Jainara, and finds her presence strangely calming.
Plot Hook. The characters are passing through the
area when Rowan is attacked by a flight of wyvern-riding
hobgoblins. Arn and Jainara are also present, and through
their combined efforts they and the characters manage to
turn back the attack. Jainara is injured during the fight,
and it is at this stage that Arn decides to turn his back on
the blade and try being a wizard full-time. Of course, being
Arn of Rowan, he cannot let the culprits get away with
hurting his master, so he offers the PCs his magic battleaxe
if they track the hobgoblins back to their base and finish
them off.
“Master Dramothir will be with you shortly. Just be sure to mind
your manners and don’t put any dirt on the furniture.”
Xelasora (LN female dragonborn 1st-level sorcerer/1st-
level wizard) is a graceful dragonborn in her late teens
with mottled blue and green scales, four short horns that
sweep back from her brow, and large amber eyes. She also
has a large, reddish birthmark on her left shoulder that
she normally keeps hidden under her robes. Xelasora is
serious and humble and possesses a razor-sharp mind.
Her master is Dramothir Galefnir (LG male dwarf 12th-
level wizard [abjurer]), who in addition to being a learned
mage is also a renowned artisan and jeweler.
Background. The youngest of seven siblings, Xelasora
lived a happy childhood, until the disastrous day when a
red dragon attacked her community and killed the rest
of her family. Mentally and emotionally scarred by the
experience, Xelasora withdrew into herself after she was
placed in an orphanage. She was ostracized by the other
children in the orphanage, who were mostly human and
considered her little more than a monster. Eventually, her
pent-up emotions boiled over and she unleashed some
of her latent magic, setting fire to the clothing of one of
her tormentors. This act led to her being expelled from
the orphanage and forced to live on the streets, where
she barely managed to stay alive by using her powers.
Finally, when all hope seemed lost, Xelasora was taken
285WIZARD'S ENTOURAGE
in by the mage Dramothir, a dwarf who was intrigued by
her intelligence and wit, and who was a natural sucker
for a damsel in distress. Since then, Xelasora has done
her best to be a dutiful apprentice and astutely handles
Dramothir’s busy schedule.
Personality. Xelasora is the best student that any
wizard could hope for. She pursues both her magical
studies and her mundane duties with the same rigorous
attention to detail and is faultless in her execution. Her
poised exterior, however, conceals a tormented soul. She
constantly doubts herself and is worried that she could
lose control of her sorcerous abilities if she becomes
flustered or upset. The deaths of her family and the
trouble she faced at the orphanage also still weigh on her
heavily, and lately she has been plagued with dreams of
fire and shadowy flying shapes, causing her to suddenly
awaken in terror.
Plot Hook. Xelasora’s magic comes from a bit of theft:
in her younger days, she stole a set of scrolls from an
ancient red dragon. The dragon still exists in the form
of a terrible undead monstrosity, and it shares a strange
link with the young dragonborn that allows the two
of them to share dreams and images of their lives. By
the time the characters enter the picture, the dragon is
close to discovering Xelasora’s
location—and when it
does so, it plans to slay
her and recover its
scrolls. Before this
event comes to pass,
the characters have
a chance to stop it,
either by destroying
the dragon or somehow
trapping it. Of course,
defeating an undead
dragon is no easy feat;
depending on the
characters’ level, the GM might
want to lead them up to the event
with battles against the dragon’s
servants in the form of ghouls, trolls,
vampires, and lesser evil dragons.
Magic ConstructsGolems and similar constructs are common features in a
wizard’s home. The most powerful mages have access to
even more dangerous and complex automatons. Although
golems are the most common of these constructs, they
seldom have any individuality or personality, making them
little more than defensive window-dressing.
Described below are several unique magic constructs,
each with its own history and personality. Some of them
are presented along with ready-made adventure scenarios.
BZELDRUIN’S HUNDRED
Spread out across the ground before you is an impressive collection
of close to a hundred wooden miniatures. Each figure resembles an
adult male, an adult female, or a child. Most seem to be human,
but you can see elves, dwarves, halflings, and even a few centaurs
and other creatures scattered among them. As soon as you notice
them, the figures begin to mimic your every movement.
Bzeldruin’s Hundred is a group of one hundred wooden
miniature figures created by the gnomish transmuter
Bzeldruin Tiwaskar to represent his friends and family.
Bzeldruin created them in celebration of his life’s many
286WIZARD'S ENTOURAGE
achievements, but their creation was flawed and they
became inhabited by an evil spirit that sought to slay the
very people they were modeled after. Unable to bring
himself to destroy them, Bzeldruin tried to seal them away
in the depths of his tower—and although he succeeded,
the effort cost him his life. Now his tower lies deserted,
enticing explorers with the promise of powerful magic if
they can overcome the horrors within.
BZELDRUIN’S HUNDRED
Medium swarm of tiny constructs, neutral evil
Armor Class 17 (natural armor)
Hit Points 88 (16d4 + 48)
Speed 10 ft.

Condition Immunities charmed, exhaustion, grappled,
paralyzed, petrified, poisoned, stunned, restrained
Senses darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 10

Challenge 7 (2,900 XP)
Immutable Form. Bzeldruin’s Hundred is immune to any
spell or effect that would alter its form.
Magic Resistance. Bzeldruin’s Hundred has advantage on
saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
Magic Weapons. Weapon attacks made by Bzeldrin’s
Hundred are magical.
Perfect Mimicry. The scores of individual figures that make
up the swarm can perfectly mimic the actions of a single
humanoid creature within 30 feet as an action. The swarm
can mimic only one creature at a time, and the act of doing
so grants the construct advantage on attack rolls and saving
throws it makes involving the mimicked creature until the
start of the construct’s next turn.
Swarm. The swarm can occupy another creature’s space and
vice versa, and the swarm can move through any opening
large enough for a Tiny figurine. The swarm can’t regain hit
points or gain temporary hit points.
Rejuvenation. If Bzeldruin’s Hundred is reduced to 0 hit
points, it collapses and disintegrates into dust, then re-forms
24 hours later in the same location with its full hit points.
There is no way to stop this rejuvenation from happening,
short of a carefully worded wish spell or divine intervention.
Slam. Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 0 ft., one target
in the swarm’s space. Hit: 33 (8d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage.
If the swarm is reduced to half its hit points or fewer, the
bludgeoning damage from its slam attack is 19 (4d6 + 5).
Hindering Strike. Any Medium or smaller creature damaged
by the swarm must make a DC 15 Strength saving throw. On
a failed save, several of the figures cling to its body, reducing
its speed by 10 feet and giving it disadvantage on Dexterity
saving throws and Dexterity checks. A creature can repeat
the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on
itself on a success.
LEOTHAR’S BUST
Floating before you is an exquisitely-crafted bust of a middle-aged
man with a balding pate and a well-cropped beard. The bust
appears to be constructed out of white marble. Its features are
animated, and the entity is watching you with an expectant
expression. Close behind the bust are two maids’ uniforms,
suspended in the air as though being worn by unseen creatures.
The archmage Leothar Wickerfrost is a noted explorer and
adventurer, and as such is often away from home for long
periods of time. During some of these absences, thieves
raided his tower, and after he surprised them on his return,
he ended up spending a lot of time cleaning up their
corpses. To rid himself of this chore, the wizard decided to
create the perfect servant, a bust in his own magnificent
image endowed with magical power.
Leothar’s bust shares many traits with its creator. It has
the same haughty and egomaniacal attitude and looks
down on those who cannot wield magic. The construct is
scrupulous in its duties and is in command of the tower’s
many servants, including a pair of modified unseen
servants wearing maid outfits. Leothar’s bust welcomes
visitors with the same abrasive manner its creator displays,
whether they are legitimate guests or intruders, but will
not take hostile action against creatures until it can discern
the details of their intentions.
LEOTHAR’S BUST

Challenge 3 (700 XP)
Magic Resistance. The bust has advantage on saving throws
against spells and other magical effects.
287WIZARD'S ENTOURAGE
Innate Spellcasting. The bust’s spellcasting ability is
Intelligence (spell save DC 14). It can innately cast the
following spells, requiring no
material components:
At will: light, mending, prestidigitation
5/day each: detect magic, floating disk
3/day each: knock, suggestion
1/day each: fear, sending
Multiattack. The bust makes two ray attacks or a single slam
attack.
Arcane Ray. Ranged Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, range 120 ft.,
one target. Hit: 14 (4d4 + 4) force damage.
Paralysis Ray. Ranged Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, range 60
ft., one target. Hit: The target must succeed on a DC 15
Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. A
creature can repeat this save at the end of each of its turns,
ending the effect on itself on a success.
Slam. Melee Weapon Attack: +1 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
Hit: 4 (1d4 + 2) bludgeoning damage.
NISRUEL’S COACHFLY
This long, narrow contraption resembles a clockwork dragonfly
that’s larger than a horse. It is fashioned from silver and lapis
lazuli, with panes of delicate-looking multicolored
stained glass for wings. The back of the
construct contains a hollow that looks like
it could hold one or more occupants.
Decades ago, the noble half-elf
wizard Nisruel created a
beautiful clockwork construct fashioned after
the enormous dragonflies of her marshy
homeland. Though she was usually content to
teleport when she wanted to go somewhere,
sometimes Nisruel wanted to travel in style—so she
crafted this construct to impress her friends and others
in the elven court. Word of her wondrous carriage spread
throughout the land shortly after she revealed it, and
Nisruel enjoyed receiving recognition for her work.
Sadly, her fame also drew the ire of her rival, the
sorceress Ymelda, who lured Nisruel and her construct
into the web of a gargantuan spider before ambushing the
wizard with foul magic. Both Nisruel and Ymelda died
in this struggle, but Nisruel’s construct survived intact,
and it still lies caught up in the webs of the great arachnid,
awaiting rescue.

Challenge 2 (450 XP)
Compartment. One Medium creature, two Small creatures,
or four Tiny creatures can comfortably fit inside the
compartment at the rear of the coachfly. A creature inside
the compartment is protected from the effects of wind, rain,
and snow, and can share any spell it casts on itself with the
coachfly if the spell also affects constructs. A creature can
enter or leave the compartment as an action but cannot
288WIZARD'S ENTOURAGE
fall out even if the coachfly is upside
down and has advantage on
grapple checks to avoid being
dragged out. Creatures in the
compartment also have total
cover against all attacks, though
if the coachfly fails a saving
throw against an area attack
that deals damage, those in the
compartment take half as much
damage. If the coachfly is destroyed,
occupants are ejected into an
unoccupied space within 5 feet of it.
An occupant of the compartment
can direct the coachfly to move and
to make attacks against a target within
range. Only one occupant can direct
the coachfly in each round, even if it
has multiple occupants. If the coachfly is
not being controlled, it moves and
attacks only to defend itself.
Immutable Form. The coachfly is
immune to any spell or effect that
would alter its form.
Magic Resistance. The coachfly has advantage on saving
throws against spells and other magical effects.
Multiattack. The coachfly makes two Light Ray attacks.
Light Ray. Ranged Spell Attack: +6 to hit, range 120 ft., one
target. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) radiant damage. A creature struck
by the ray must also make a successful DC 14 Constitution
saving throw or be blinded until the end of its next turn.
SIVVAR’S WRITING DESK
This large ebony writing table has glossy brass fittings and a
broad, flat top, dangling from which is a thin brass chain. Carved
at the end of the desk’s wooden legs are the claws of some sort of
beast. As you approach, these claws animate and paw menacingly
at the ground.
Over a century ago, the wizard Sivvar was counted among
the most learned historians of his age. So respected was
he that people came from miles around to ask him for
help in tracking down lost relics, forgotten tombs, and
ancient ruins. The knowledge he amassed came with a
price, though, and Sivvar eventually gathered many secrets
that were too dangerous to be shared openly. To protect
himself and his works, Sivvar fashioned a construct out
of his writing desk. Not only would this piece of simple
furniture store the knowledge he had gathered, it would
protect itself from harm if someone tried to take the
contents by force.
Recently, after years of foiling or dodging enemy
attacks, Sivvar suddenly vanished, leaving his desk and
other worldly possessions in the care of his sister’s
granddaughter, Emelia Nightmace. Emelia knows that
her great-uncle’s mansion and possessions are potentially
dangerous and seeks the help of adventurers to enter the
place and catalogue its contents. What she doesn’t know is
that Sivvar is still alive somewhere inside the mansion, and
his desk holds the key to contacting him.

Antimagic Susceptibility. The desk is incapacitated while in
the area of an antimagic field. If targeted by dispel magic, the
289WIZARD'S ENTOURAGE
desk must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against
the caster’s spell save DC or become inanimate for 1 minute.
Immutable Form. The desk is immune to any spell or effect
that would alter its form.
False Appearance. While the desk remains motionless, it is
indistinguishable from a normal writing desk.
Locked Drawers. The drawers of the desk are locked by a
modified version of the arcane lock spell. The desk opens its
drawers when someone speaks the appropriate command
word. If someone tries to open the drawers without the
correct password, the desk animates and attacks.
Oddities For Every Occasion
Multiattack. The desk makes two claw attacks.
Claw. Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
Hit: 14 (3d6 + 4) slashing damage.
Rake. If the desk hits the same target with both claw attacks,
it rakes the victim for an extra 10 (3d6) slashing damage.
Desperate Escape (1/day). The desk can use dimension door
as a bonus action. It uses this ability only when reduced to
10 hit points or fewer.
From wands that shoot out darts of force and potions that
allow you to breathe underwater to magic airships and
iron barrels that turn into crabs, wizards are behind the
creation of most of the magic items found in a standard
fantasy setting. Yet not every magic item is as generally
useful or powerful as those mentioned above. Some of the
magic items found in a wizard’s laboratory or workshop
fill a niche role, are the results of failed experiments,
function as normal magic items but have a different
appearance, or are just plain bizarre.
While characters explore a wizard’s tower or
stronghold, an adventurer might come across a variety
of strange magic items, some of which are more helpful
than others. To determine what a character finds while
searching, roll on the table below or choose one or more
items at your discretion.
D
1 An animated weapon rack with long, thin wooden arms that hands out any item stored in it on command. The
weapon rack doesn’t defend itself if attacked (AC 15, hp 20, damage threshold 3, vulnerability to fire damage).
2 A battered copper lantern that sings a bawdy folk tale in Goblin whenever oil is placed inside it and it is lit. The
singing can be heard clearly from up to 300 feet away.
3 A chamber pot that teleports its contents into an extradimensional space on command. There is a 25 percent
chance that the chamber pot malfunctions and teleports its contents onto the head of a nearby creature.
4 A bright purple skullcap with fancy golden embroidery that turns the wearer’s head invisible and renders the
wearer mute. The wearer can see and hear normally, and can remove the skullcap without impediment.
5 A painting of a beautiful half-elf girl staring off into a pond. The girl animates and curtsies whenever a living
creature comes within 10 feet of her. If the painting is attacked, the girl cowers in terror but does not make a
sound. The painting is as hard as steel (AC 19, hp 20, damage threshold 8, resistance to all damage).
6 A wind chime made of bones that emits a clear ringing sound whenever any spell is cast within 30 feet of it. The
chime does not react to normal winds and does not activate while being carried, worn, or held.
7 A tiny animated bronze rat that causes irrational fear in any feline that sees it. A feline creature of challenge
rating 1 or lower that comes within 30 feet of the rat must make a successful DC 10 Wisdom saving throw or be
frightened for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself
on a success. The rat has the statistics of a normal rat, but it is immune to poison and psychic damage and to being
charmed, frightened, exhausted, paralyzed, poisoned, petrified, or stunned.
8 A white silk handkerchief that functions as a cloak of protection, but only when worn by a Tiny creature.
There is a 33 percent chance that the handkerchief is currently being worn by a homunculus.
9 A set of false black eyelashes in a metal case. The lashes can be put on or removed as an action. Whenever a creature
the wearer would be physically attracted to comes within 10 feet, the wearer is forced to wink repeatedly in the
direction of the other creature. The wearer can resist this compulsion with a successful DC 11 Wisdom saving throw.

10 Twelve identical decorative silver nails that ignore the damage threshold of any nonmagical object they are nailed
into and can hold up to 5,000 pounds of weight. The nails cannot be used as weapons, and they lose their magic if
they are extracted after being used.
11 A clear crystal prism containing a mummified elven ear. When the prism is placed against a surface where a
compartment lies beyond, such as a closed door, a random illusory sound is generated that seems to be coming
from the other side.
12 A leather-bound booklet that contains illustrations of various creatures and objects. The booklet functions as a
robe of useful items, except that it has only the twelve patches found on each robe. When the last page is torn out, the
booklet becomes useless.
13 A ceramic and gold bathtub shaped like a dragon and painted bright crimson. The bathtub fills with hot, scented
water that pours from the dragon’s maw on command and fills the tub. The bathtub regains the use of this ability
each day at dawn.
14 A glass globe filled with pale yellow smoke that swirls menacingly when touched. When shattered, the globe
replicates the effects of a wand of wonder and produces a smell like rotten eggs. The sphere magically re-forms in
1d6 days unless dispel magic is cast on the fragments.
15 A tiny lump of cream-colored wax in a small wooden box. It shapes itself into a wax duplicate of any living creature
that touches it for more than 1 round. The creature that was mimicked can cause its duplicate to move up to 10 feet
as an action and to perform simple actions (but not attack). The wax figurine has a Strength score of 2 for lifting
and carrying purposes. After 1 hour, the wax duplicate becomes inert and resumes its normal form. It cannot be
reactivated until the following dawn.
16 A potted plant of unknown origin in a dark blue vase. The plant’s berries are actually gems worth 10 gp each. A
total of 2d6 gems can be collected from the plant, but if every gem is picked the plant transforms into either a great
mandrake (Creature Codex, p. 260) or an awakened tree and attacks the picker.
17 A featureless wooden mannequin that cloaks itself in the illusion of whatever clothing the viewer desires. The range
of clothing the mannequin can generate is limited only by the viewer’s imagination. The mannequin is treated as a
normal wooden object for combat purposes (AC 15, hp 30, damage threshold 4, vulnerability to fire damage).
18 A featureless wooden mannequin holding a wooden sword and shield that stands silently in the center of a
20-foot-radius red circle. The mannequin animates when a creature brandishing a weapon enters the circle. The
mannequin uses the statistics of either a wood golem (Creature Codex, p. 201) or animated armor. If it reduces
a creature to 0 hit points, the creature is knocked unconscious rather than being killed. The mannequin stops
attacking if the creature threatening it or attacking it leaves the circle.
19 A small gilded birdcage covered in exotic filigree and mounted on a greenstone plinth. The cage grants the
semblance of life to any dead creature of Tiny size placed inside it. The creature appears to be alive for all intents
and purposes, but only while it is inside the cage. As soon as the creature leaves the cage, it returns to its dead state
in the same condition it entered. The cage ceases to function if removed from its plinth. The cage currently holds a
songbird (01–25), a raven (26–50), or a pixie (56–75), or is empty (76–00).
20 A Large stone font inscribed with arcane symbols. The font produces one dose of a random potion each day at
dawn. Someone who drinks from the font gains the effect of the potion. If the liquid is removed from the font
and placed inside another container, it loses its magical properties. The font weighs more than 200 pounds, so
transporting it is difficult.
291WIZARD'S ENTOURAGE
Familiar Territory
Although the list of available familiars in the standard
rules is sufficient for most campaigns, some players and
GMs might enjoy using an unusual creature that has
features not found in other familiars.
To determine what familiar an NPC spellcaster might
have, the GM can roll on one of the tables in this section or
select a creature. Players can also use these tables to choose
familiars for their characters, with the GM’s approval. (Of
course, any creature that can be a familiar must also exist
in the world on its own.)
The familiars presented here are of two basic kinds:
standard familiars, which function the same as other
beasts that serve the caster of the find familiar spell, and
variant familiars, each of which is an intelligent creature
that offers a special benefit to its master.
As stated in the find familiar spell, each of these creatures
gains the celestial, fey, or fiend type (spellcaster’s choice)
when it becomes a familiar. Also, as noted in the spell, a
familiar can’t attack (though it can deliver a touch spell on
behalf of its master). The stat blocks in this section include
information on attacks, because it might come into play if
any of these creatures are encountered as monsters in their
own right, or perhaps as allies of the player characters.
With the GM’s consent, any of the beasts described in this
section can be chosen by a character who casts the find
familiar spell. These creatures might also be encountered
as the familiars of NPC spellcasters.

Feasting on the hearts of fallen evil warriors on battlefields
has corrupted these crows. They resemble normal crows,
but they are easily distinguished by their rust-colored,
barbed beaks and a patch of feathers on their breasts of the
same color. Sometimes, carrion crows use their mimicry
to lure animals and people into danger, in hopes of having
more dead meat on which to feast.
Evil spellcasters find carrion crows to be capable
familiars. The creatures are happy to serve a master if they
are provided with a steady supply of dead flesh and blood.

a successful saving throw, a creature is immune to the shriek
of any carrion crow for 1 hour.
The catfish shark lives in deep water. Most species are

helps goldbugs get close to their prized food source: gold.
When placed in a pouch or chest along with the gold coins

but before the roll takes place. A creature that attacks the
hedgehog must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity check or take
1 piercing damage. A creature that uses a reach weapon or
a ranged weapon against the hedgehog is unaffected by

use its bite on another target. While the target is grappled,
the wharfling’s bite attack hits it automatically.
Pilfer. A wharfling that has an opponent grappled at the start
of its turn can make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check as a
bonus action against a DC equal to 10 + the grappled target’s
Dexterity modifier. On a successful check, the wharfling
steals a small metallic object from the target, and the theft is

Variant FamiliarsThis section expands the roster of potential familiars to
include several intelligent creatures with supernatural
abilities. The relationship between the familiar and its
master, and the benefits the master receives, resembles
how the imp, the quasit, and the pseudodragon are
presented as variant familiars in the standard rules.
If the GM allows the use of any of these variant familiars
by player characters, it might or might not be necessary
for the would-be master to start the process by casting find
familiar. Either way, a variant familiar is an actual creature
(not a spirit) that serves at its own discretion, obeying
its master’s commands only when doing so does not
immediately bring it harm, and it will not hesitate to end
the link with its master as a matter of self-preservation.
Unlike standard familiars, a variant familiar does not
disappear if it drops to 0 hit points; it simply dies or falls
unconscious (GM’s choice).

These creatures can be found in vast numbers in the lower
planes, mostly providing fodder for demons and other
denizens. Typically, an abyssal worm measures a foot to a
foot and a half in length, its body gray in color, with mossy
green and mustard yellow mottling. The worm’s mouth is
a round orifice ringed with sharp, needle-like teeth. The
worm’s skin exudes a slime that leaves a glistening trail in
its path.
Evil spellcasters often choose the abyssal worm as a
familiar as an intimidation tactic. The creature’s disgusting
appearance makes it an excellent tool for unnerving
others, especially if they aren’t hardened adventurers.
Abyssal worms are happy to serve as familiars, so long as
they get a steady diet of flesh and the chance to torment
the living.
Familiar. If an abyssal worm agrees to serve another
creature as a familiar, it forms a telepathic bond with its
master. While the two are bonded, the master can sense
what the abyssal worm senses, as long as they are within
1 mile of each other. While the abyssal worm is within 10
feet of its master, the master gains the worm’s immunity to
poison damage and the poisoned condition. If its master
causes it physical harm, or if it simply chooses to do so,
the abyssal worm will abandon its service as a familiar,
breaking the telepathic bond.

Hit: 5 (1d4+3) piercing damage plus 1 poison damage, and
296WIZARD'S ENTOURAGE
the abyssal worm attaches to the target. While attached,
the abyssal worm doesn't attack. Instead, at the start of the
abyssal worm's turn, the target loses 5 (1d4+3) hit points
due to blood loss and also takes 1 poison damage.
The abyssal worm can detach itself by spending 5 feet of
movement. It does so after draining 10 hit points of blood
from its target or when the target dies. A creature, including
the target, can use an action to detach the abyssal worm.
The alkonost is a graceful bird that has the face of a
beautiful man or woman. Flocks of these creatures lurk
on the edges of dark clouds. Their plumage is the color
of storms, ranging from light gray to dark slate with a
shimmer of green or violet hue on the eldest.
Familiar. If an alkonost agrees to serve another creature
as a familiar, it forms a telepathic bond with its master.
While the two are bonded, the master can sense what the
alkonost senses, as long as they are within 1 mile of each
other. While the alkonost is within 10 feet of its master,
the master shares the alkonost’s One with Wind trait. If its
master causes it physical harm, or if it simply chooses to
do so, the alkonost will abandon its service as a familiar,
ending the telepathic bond.

Charged Melody (Recharge 6). The alkonost sings a beautiful
melody. Each creature within 30 feet of it that can hear the

take 7 (2d6) lightning damage the next time it moves.
An evil drake that resembles a pseudodragon, the
crimson drake is a popular familiar among evil evokers,
particularly those who favor fire magic. An evil warlock
who has the Pact of the Chain can acquire a crimson drake
companion in place of a quasit, while an evil wizard can
procure the services of one through treats and sacrifices
worth at least 150 gp.
Familiar. If a crimson drake agrees to serve another
creature as a familiar, it forms a telepathic bond with its
master. While the two are bonded, the master can sense
what the crimson drake senses, as long as they are within
1 mile of each other. While the crimson drake is within
10 feet of its master, the master shares the drake’s Magic
Resistance trait. At any time and for any reason, the
drake can abandon its service as a familiar, ending the

burning venom. They have a dim intelligence that makes
them more dangerous than common snakes.
Familiar. If an infernal viper agrees to serve another
creature as a familiar, it forms a telepathic bond with its
master. While the two are bonded, the master can sense
what the infernal viper senses, as long as they are within 1
mile of each other. While the infernal viper is within 10 feet
of its master, the master gains the viper’s resistance to fire
damage. If its master causes it physical harm, or if it simply
chooses to do so, the viper will abandon its service as a
familiar, breaking the telepathic bond.

The kuunganisha is a type of fiend that appears to have
been specifically created by the powers of villainy to serve
as a familiar. An evil warlock who has the Pact of the Chain
can summon a kuunganisha in place of a quasit or an imp,
while a wizard can acquire one only by casting a planar
binding spell (though the kuunganisha serves the wizard
permanently in this case, rather than for just 24 hours).
Familiar. If a kuunganisha agrees to serve another
creature as a familiar, it forms a telepathic bond with its
master. While the two are bonded, the master can sense
what the kuunganisha senses, as long as they are within 1

it simply chooses to do so, the kuunganisha will abandon
its service as a familiar, breaking the telepathic bond.

Fiend Sight. Magical darkness doesn’t impede the fiend’s
darkvision.
Magic Resistance. The kuunganisha has advantage on saving
throws against spells and other magical effects.
Regeneration. The kuunganisha regains 1 hp at the start of
its turn if it has at least 1 hp.
Will of the Master. The master of a kuunganisha familiar can
cast a spell through the creature, using the fiend’s senses
to target the spell. The range limitations are treated as if
the spell originated from the kuunganisha, not the master.
The spell effect occurs on the kuunganisha’s turn, though
the master must cast the spell during the master’s turn.
Concentration spells must still be maintained by the master.
Multiattack. The kuunganisha makes one claw attack and
one bite attack.
Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
Hit: 5 (1d4 + 3) piercing damage, and the target must
succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or take 5
(2d4) poison damage and become poisoned for 1 minute.
The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of
its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
Claw. Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
Hit: 8 (2d4 + 3) slashing damage.
Invisibility. The kuunganisha magically turns invisible until it
attacks, or until its concentration ends (as if concentrating
on a spell). Any equipment the fiend wears or carries
becomes invisible with it.
Appearing as a wild cat with hawk-like wings, the leonino
is a much sought-after familiar by elf wizards, particularly
those who have an affinity for air or wind. Acquiring a
leonino familiar requires the casting of the find familiar
spell, with an additional offering of fine fish and at least
200 feet of dyed red yarn. Once the spell is cast, the wizard
makes a Charisma check contested by the leonino’s
Charisma check. If the leonino wins the contest, the
298WIZARD'S ENTOURAGE
creature flies off and the wizard is hated and distrusted by
all feline creatures for at least a month.
Familiar. If a leonino agrees to serve another creature
as a familiar, it forms a telepathic bond with its master.
While the two are bonded, the master can sense what the
leonino senses, as long as they are within 1 mile of each
other. While the leonino is within 10 feet of its master,
the master gains the leonino’s Evasion trait. If its master
causes it physical harm, or if it simply chooses to do so,
the leonino will abandon its service as a familiar, breaking
the telepathic bond.

Flyby. The leonino doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks when
it flies out of an enemy’s reach.
Evasion. If the leonino is subjected to an effect that allows it
to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage,
the leonino instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the
saving throw, and only half damage if it fails.
Silent Wings. The flight of a leonino is especially silent
and difficult to notice in forests and urban settings. It has
advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made while flying in
these areas.
Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
Hit: 5 (1d4 + 3) slashing damage. If this is the first time
the leonino has hit the target within the past 24 hours, the
target must succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw or be
charmed by the leonino for 1 hour.
These strange-looking constructs are unusually intelligent
for creatures of their type and will sometimes serve a
lawful or neutral spellcaster (though never a chaotic one)
as a familiar.
Familiar. If a library automaton agrees to serve another
creature as a familiar, it forms a telepathic bond with its
master. While the two are bonded, the master can sense
what the library automaton senses, as long as they are
within 1 mile of each other. While the automaton is within
10 feet of its master, the master gains the automaton’s
immunity to poison damage and the poisoned condition.
If its master causes it physical harm, or if it simply chooses
to do so, the automaton will abandon its service as a
familiar, breaking the telepathic bond.

Extradimensional Book Repository. A small door
on the chest of the library automaton opens into an
extradimensional bookcase. This bookcase functions exactly
as a bag of holding, except that it can store only written
materials, such as books, scrolls, tomes, parchment, folders,
notebooks, spellbooks, and the like.
Gaze of Confusion. The library automaton chooses one
creature it can see within 40 feet. The target must succeed
on a DC 12 Intelligence saving throw or take 9 (3d4 + 2)
psychic damage and have disadvantage on Intelligence-
based checks, saving throws, and attack rolls until the end
of its next turn. On a successful save, the target takes half as
much damage and suffers no other effect.
Bibliotelekinesis. This ability functions as the mage hand
cantrip but can be used only on books, scrolls, maps, and
other printed or written materials.
One of the rarer and more bizarre options for a familiar
is the living shade, a fey creature often confused with
undead creatures such as the shadow. Illusionists,
wizards who specialize in shadow, and Pact of the
Archfey warlocks are the most common masters of these
creatures. Obtaining a living shade by casting the find
familiar spell requires an additional material component:
50 gp worth of powdered jet.
Familiar. If a living shade agrees to serve another
creature as a familiar, it forms a telepathic bond with its
master. While the two are bonded, the master can sense
what the living shade senses, as long as they are within 1
mile of each other. While the living shade is within 10 feet
of its master, the master gains the living shade’s Shadow

Sunlight Sensitivity. While in sunlight, the living shade
has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom

Shadow Touch. Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft.,

STRYX
Owl-like monstrosities with vaguely human-like heads,
stryx sometimes serve mortal spellcasters, particularly one
of elven blood or one who has some tie to the fey, such as a
half-elf enchanter or a warlock whose patron is the Archfey.
Familiar. If a stryx agrees to serve another creature as a
familiar, it forms a telepathic bond with its master. While
the two are bonded, the master can sense what the stryx
senses, as long as they are within 1 mile of each other.
While the stryx is within 10 feet of its master, the master

Keen Hearing and Sight. The stryx has advantage on
Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or sight.
Talons. Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one

These tiny constructs that resemble will-o-wisps are
similar to homunculi, in that they are created (from pieces
of quartz) and animated by their creators rather than
brought into being by the spell. Conjurers and spellcasters
who concentrate on illumination and light magic are the
most common masters of these constructs.
Familiar. If a witchlight agrees to serve another creature
as a familiar, it forms a telepathic bond with its master.
While the two are bonded, the master can sense what
the witchlight senses, as long as they are within 1 mile of

Dispel Magic Weakness. Casting dispel magic on a witchlight
paralyzes it for 1d10 rounds.
Luminance. A witchlight normally glows as brightly as a
torch. The creature can dim itself to the luminosity of a
candle, but it cannot extinguish its light. Because of its
glow, the witchlight has disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth)
checks.
Thin as Light. Although a witchlight is not incorporeal, it can
pass through any opening that light can.
Light Ray. Ranged Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, range 30 ft., one
target. Hit: 6 (1d4 + 4) radiant damage.
Flash (Recharge 5–6). The witchlight emits a bright burst
of light that causes any sighted creature within 30 feet to
be blinded for 1d4 rounds unless it succeeds on a DC 10
Constitution saving throw.
Woodland-dwelling monstrosities, wolpertingers are
popular familiars among gnomish wizards but will serve
just about any spellcaster if they are treated with care and
respect. Since these creatures are more powerful than a
standard familiar, 25 gp worth of holly berries must also be
expended as part of the casting of the find familiar spell.
Familiar. If a wolpertinger agrees to serve another
creature as a familiar, it forms a telepathic bond with its
master. While the two are bonded, the master can sense
what the wolpertinger senses, as long as they are within 1
mile of each other. While the wolpertinger is within 10 feet
of its master, the master gains the wolpertinger’s Standing

Clockwork magic is a style of magic from the Midgard
Campaign Setting, divinely granted to humans and
dwarves by the goddess Rava, patron of industry and
mistress of time.
If you play in Midgard, or if you want to add clockwork
magic to your game, this category of magic includes
several temporal magic spells and some of the spells
described earlier in this book. For additional, specific
spells to heal or control clockworks, see the Midgard
Heroes Handbook.
FAMILIARSA wizard who embraces clockwork magic can use the find
familiar spell in a special way. A small clockwork device
in the form of an animal (worth 10 gp) is substituted for
the spell’s usual material component. The device must
resemble one of the allowable animals listed in the spell.
When the casting is complete, the clockwork animates.
It has the statistics of the chosen animal form, but is a
construct, rather than a beast.
A clockwork familiar’s form can be changed by rebuilding
the clockwork device into a new form of animal and
casting the spell again. If the familiar is destroyed, it can
be rebuilt (in the same form or a new one) with the same
components, if they are recovered; otherwise, 10 gp must
be spent on replacement parts.

as borne out in the lists that follow. The spells in these lists

The minotaurs created what they call “labyrinth magic”
long ago, a result of their fascination with and mastery
of mazes. Spells of this sort tend to involve elements
of confusion, dimensional manipulation, and the
strengthening of the minotaur’s natural weapons. They
are rarely taught to outsiders.

This appendix is intended primarily for the GM’s use in
equipping villains and other NPCs with particularly vile
or dangerous sorts of magic. Although it is possible that
some of these spells will find their way into the hands
of spellcasting player characters, most good-aligned
characters might (understandably) have doubts about
using magic fueled by bloodletting, the forces of the
Void, or the Elder Gods. How far the GM allows player
characters to progress along this dark path is an individual
decision, but it should be clear from the nature of the
material that anyone who uses these purely maleficent
forms of magic must be prepared to accept the unpleasant
and sometimes debilitating consequences.
The tradition of apocalypse magic is one road that evil
wizards and other arcane casters can follow to power.
It also leads clerics and prophets into the service of
ambitious, destructive deities.
Entropy is sometimes seen as synonymous with death
and the end of days. In truth, it’s a facet of nature as
inescapable as the four elements and the laws of alchemy.
Doomsday cults relish the approaching apocalypse,
espousing love while threatening damnation for
unbelievers; kings and lords threaten to tear down all of
civilization just to add a new province to their realms.
Apocalypse magic isn’t widely practiced, because of its
inherent destructiveness. At the same time, practitioners
can be found in a vast variety of situations. Devotees
of dark lords, emissaries of hostile interplanar beings,
leaders of vicious cults, and a host of other villainous
threats might be workers of apocalypse magic.
When and where this branch of magic originated is
unknown. Some scholars see it as the ultimate expression
of natural law, while others consider it a divine gift or the
manifestation of a chaotic deity’s will. Whatever its source,
apocaplyse magic’s potential to harm, weaken, terrify, and
empower makes it one of the most dangerous magical arts.
All spellcasting classes except for the ranger have access
to certain kinds of apocalypse magic, as shown in the
following lists.

Sickening energy radiates out from you in a sphere with

centered on you and moves with you. Each hostile creature
in the sphere has disadvantage on saving throws against
becoming frightened, paralyzed, poisoned, or stunned.
Creatures in the sphere can’t gain temporary hit points,
and any effect that restores hit points to a creature within
the sphere has those hit points reduced by an amount

within 40 feet of the black hole when it appears must make
a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature
takes 20d6 force damage and is pulled to within 5 feet of
the black hole. On a successful save, the creature takes half

toward the black hole.
A creature that’s within 5 feet of the black hole at the

throw or take 8d6 force damage and have its speed
reduced to 0 until the start of its next turn. A creature
that’s within 40 feet of the black hole (but not within 5
feet of it) at the end of its turn takes 2d6 cold damage. A

Duration: Instantaneous
Description:
creature within range casting a spell
You attempt to hijack a spell being cast and redirect it to
serve your purpose. If the spell is being cast with a spell
slot of 3rd level or lower, you choose the target or targets
for the spell instead of its caster. If the spell is being cast
with a spell slot of 4th level or higher, make an ability
check using your spellcasting ability against a DC of 12
+ the spell’s level. On a successful check, you choose the
target or targets for the spell.
Your targets must be valid targets for the spell based on
the caster’s ability and the range of the spell, but using
your distinctions for friendly and hostile creatures.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a

amber, worth at least 1,500 gp)
You blast a creature within range with a beam of pure,
entropic energy that ages it rapidly. The target takes 4d6
necrotic damage and must make a successful Constitution

are both reduced to 1. While its Strength and Dexterity
are reduced in this way, the creature can’t hold weapons
weighing more than 3 pounds, its speed is halved, and it
can’t take reactions. The creature’s Armor Class and attack
rolls are modified to account for its reduced attributes. The
creature can cast spells normally.
An affected creature can repeat the saving throw after
it finishes a long rest, ending the effect on a success. The
effect can also be ended by greater restoration, wish, or
comparable magic.

a tombstone)
You examine the life force in a creature you touch and
sense when it will expire. You and the creature share a
vision of the most likely way in which the creature will die.
You both sense approximately how far into the future the
event occurs. The vision is not a prophecy or a definite fate;
life can take unexpected twists and turns. It is, however,
the most likely outcome at the current time unless the
creature alters the course of its life. The vision can seem to
last as little as a few moments or as long as 30 minutes to
you and the spell’s target, but in the objective world, the
knowledge is received instantaneously.

can use an action to see what the undead creature sees
(including through darkvision, blindsight, tremorsense,

your next turn. You use your own ability scores and skill
proficiencies to spot things and to interpret the sensations
you’re receiving.

spell attack against the creature. On a hit, the target

opportunity attacks. Each creature whose space you pass
through takes 6d6 fire damage, or half as much damage
with a successful Dexterity saving throw.
You leave a 5-foot-wide line of hellfire burning behind
you in your path. This hellfire continues burning for
a number of rounds equal to your spellcasting ability

creature)
Specify a 5-foot-square space of natural ground (not solid
stone) that you can see within range, then choose any
undead creature of challenge rating 1 or lower (such as a
specter, ghoul, shadow, zombie, or skeleton). That creature
claws its way up out of the ground and immediately tries to
grapple or attack a creature within 5 feet.
The undead uses its standard stat block, but it has only 10
hit points and is prone until it stands up. It takes its turn
immediately after yours. You can use a bonus action to
issue a mental command to the undead when you cast the
spell, and you can change the command by using a bonus
action on your turn while the spell is active. Once given an
order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is
complete. If you issue no command, the creature defends
itself and attacks the last enemy that attacked it.
The creature remains under your control for 1 hour, after
which it crumbles to dust or disappears.
At Higher Levels. The number of undead you summon
increases when you cast this spell with a higher-level spell
slot: two when cast with a 5th-level slot, three with a 7th-
level slot, and four with a 9th-level slot.

A creature whose hit points are reduced to 0 by this

You elevate your body to a higher form. When you cast

lasts, you can use a bonus action to exchange one of your

Breath Weapon. You gain a breath weapon of one of
these types of your choice: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or

The breath weapon is considered a magical attack. You can

third use.
Limbs. Appendages resembling tentacles, spider legs,
pincers, or something else of your choosing sprout from
your body. Choose slashing, bludgeoning, or piercing

attacks with your new limbs, and each attack deals 2d12
damage of the chosen type. You are proficient with these
weapons, and they have the reach and finesse properties.
Radiating Light. You emit light in a 10-foot radius. The
light can come from a halo, from ghostly flames, from your
eyes, or any other source you choose. The light deals your
choice of necrotic, fire, or radiant damage. A creature that
passes through the light on its turn or that ends its turn in
the light takes 2d10 damage of the chosen type, or half as
much damage with a successful Constitution saving throw.
A creature takes this damage only once per turn.
Regeneration. You regain 10 hit points at the start of

Name: WITHERING SMITE
Level: 1
School: Necromancy
Casting Time: 1 bonus action
Range: Self
Components: V
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Description:
Your weapon radiates terrible energy that empowers the
next strike you make with it. The next time you hit with
a melee weapon attack during this spell’s duration, your
attack deals an extra 1d6 necrotic damage.
If the target of that attack was a creature, it must make a
successful Constitution saving throw or take 1d6 necrotic
damage at the start of each of its turns for 1 minute, its
flesh rotting around the wound. An affected creature can
repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns,
ending the effect on a success. The rotting effect also ends
if the affected creature receives magical healing.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell
slot of 2nd level or higher, the extra damage dealt by the
weapon’s hit increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.
Subsequent necrotic damage doesn’t increase.
Gods with the Apocalypse domain in their portfolios
promote fear, judgment, punishment, and the end of all
things.
Priesthoods of such gods consider themselves the
messengers of that doom, and they work to spread word
of the coming end. Their gloomy, often frightening
message makes them unwelcome in many, but not all,
civilized places.
1st bane, grim siphon
3rd blindness/deafness, enthrall
5th bestow curse, fear
7th blight, confusion
9th contact other plane, souleater
When you choose this domain at 1st level, you learn the
vicious mockery cantrip. You also gain proficiency in either
Arcana or Survival (your choice).
CHANNEL DIVINITY: DAMNATION
Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity
to lash out at those who defy your deity’s messenger. As an
action, you present your holy symbol while pronouncing
doom to unbelievers. Each hostile creature that can see
you and is within 30 feet of you takes necrotic damage
equal to 3d6 + your cleric level, or half as much damage
with a successful Wisdom saving throw. A creature that has
total cover from you is not affected.
CHANNEL DIVINITY: WEIGHT OF GUILT
At 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity to
manipulate a creature’s thoughts. You can then use
your access to the creature’s mind as an advantage when
interrogating it.
As an action, choose one creature that you can see within
60 feet of you. That creature must make a Wisdom saving
throw. On a failed save, you automatically know for the
next 10 minutes whether anything the target says is true, a
lie, or in between. On a successful save, the target cannot
be affected by this spell until you finish a long rest.
At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon
strikes with necrotic energy. Once on each of your turns,
you can cause a weapon attack to deal an extra 1d8 necrotic
damage to the target on a hit. When you reach 14th level,
the extra damage increases to 2d8.
At 17th level, you gain resistance to acid, fire, and poison
damage.
The oath of the annihilator is as ancient as the darkness
between stars.
These paladins—sometimes called antipaladins, dark
paladins, or death knights—represent the antithesis of the
ideal paladin. Paladins who take this oath see themselves
as divine instruments of reckoning and foretellers of
armageddon. Despite their extreme viewpoint and often
brutal behavior, they still conduct themselves honorably
and expect to be treated with respect.
Many who swear this oath are devoted to gods of
destruction, chaos, and war.
The principles of the oath of the annihilator are simple.
They emphasize the value of strength above all else.
• Extinguish the Weak. An enemy who lacks the strength
to prevail in combat must be ushered into the embrace
of death.
• Maintain the Balance. For life to flourish, there must
be destruction. The strong endure, the weak succumb.
• Revel in Destruction. All things end, especially life.
Everyone has only a limited time to experience mortal
delights, the greatest of which are combat and strife.
• Embrace the End. Death should not be feared. Since it
comes for everyone, best be prepared for it at any time.
When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following
two Channel Divinity options.
Vow of Ruin. As a bonus action, you can utter a vow
of ruination using your Channel Divinity. For 1 minute
thereafter, successful attacks you make against objects
and constructs are treated as critical hits. If your weapon
isn’t a magic weapon, it becomes a magic weapon with a +1
bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls for the duration of
this effect.
Wither Foe. As an action, you can present your holy
symbol and speak a prayer of damnation, using your
Channel Divinity. Choose one creature within 60 feet of
you that you can see. That creature must make a Charisma
saving throw. On a failed save, it takes necrotic damage
equal to your Charisma modifier + your paladin level, and
it has disadvantage on saving throws for 1 minute or until
it’s reduced to 0 hit points.
You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed.
3rd bane, proselytize
5th augury, shatter
9th bestow curse, phantom steed
13th blight, caustic waste
17th contagion, hallow
Starting at 7th level, you and allied creatures within 10
feet of you are immune to the frightened condition.
When you or an allied creature within 10 feet of you takes
damage, the damage is reduced by an amount equal to
your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1). At 18th level, the
range of this effect increases to 30 feet.
Starting at 15th level, your smites are powerful enough to
bring your foes to their knees. When you use your Divine
Smite against a creature that is Large or smaller, the
creature must make a successful Strength saving throw or
be knocked prone.
At 20th level, you can use an action to assume the form of
a harbinger of the apocalypse. Your appearance alters in
some frightening way of your choosing. For example, your
skin could take on the texture of broken stone and magma,
your hair could become flames, or you could sprout
demonic horns and a tail. For 1 minute thereafter, you gain
the following benefits:
• When you reduce a creature to 0 hit points, you heal 20
hit points.
• Your attacks and spells ignore a target’s resistance to
damage.
• You add your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1) to
your saving throws.
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you
finish a long rest.
The magic you seek is as powerful as it is destructive.
Any fool can learn to hurl a fireball, but only a master of the
apocalypse can open a black hole. Some doomsayers use
their terrible power to amass a conquering army; others
seek to become a force of darkness and to reshape the
world according to their own vision.
Beginning when you select this specialty at 2nd level, the
gold and time you must spend to copy an apocalypse spell
into your spellbook is halved.
At 2nd level, you gain the ability to instill a sense of
impending doom in creatures who witness your power.
When you kill a creature with a spell that isn’t a cantrip,
you can use a bonus action to select one or more creatures
within 30 feet of the creature you just killed. Each of those
creatures must make a successful Wisdom saving throw
or become frightened of you for 1 minute. A frightened
creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of
its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you
finish a long rest.
Starting at 6th level, whenever you score a critical hit with a
spell attack, choose one of the following two effects:
• Every creature affected by the spell must make a
successful Wisdom saving throw or become frightened
of you until the end of its next turn.
• Every creature affected by the spell must make a
successful Constitution saving throw or become
poisoned until the end of its next turn.
Starting at 10th level, you have advantage when making
spell attack rolls against creatures that are frightened or
poisoned.
Beginning at 14th level, your spell attacks score critical hits
when the attack roll is a natural 19 or 20.
Blood MagicBlood is life, and blood magic is closely tied to the dark
gods, blood sacrifices, and malevolent casters. Typically,
this style of magic is found among vengeful druids, dark
magical societies, cultists of forbidden gods, and lone
arcane practitioners with a wanton disregard for others.
Blood Magic Spell Lists
As might be expected, sorcerers and wizards have the

=== SPELL START ===
Name: BLOOD AND STEEL
Level: 4
School: Transmutation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Description:
When you cast this spell, you cut your hand and take 1d4
slashing damage that can’t be healed until you take a long
rest. You then touch a construct; it must make a successful
Constitution saving throw or be charmed by you for the
duration. If you or your allies are fighting the construct, it
has advantage on the saving throw. Even constructs that
are immune to charm effects can be affected by this spell.
While the construct is charmed, you have a telepathic
link with it as long as the two of you are on the same plane
of existence. You can use this telepathic link to issue
commands to the creature while you are conscious (no
action required), which it does its best to obey. You can
specify a simple and general course of action, such as,
“Attack the ghouls,” “Block the bridge,” or, “Fetch that
bucket.” If the construct completes the order and doesn’t
receive further direction from you, it defends itself.
You can use your action to take total and precise control
of the target. Until the end of your next turn, the construct
takes only the actions you specify and does nothing you
haven’t ordered it to do. During this time, you can also
cause the construct to use a reaction, but doing this
requires you to use your own reaction as well.
Each time the construct takes damage, it makes a new
Constitution saving throw against the spell. If the saving
throw succeeds, the spell ends.
If the construct is already under your control when the
spell is cast, it gains an Intelligence of 10 (unless its own
Intelligence is higher, in which case it retains the higher
score) for 4 hours. The construct is capable of acting
independently, though it remains loyal to you for the
spell’s duration. You can also grant the target a bonus
equal to your Intelligence modifier on one skill in which
you have proficiency.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
5th-level spell slot, the duration is concentration, up to
10 minutes. When you use a 6th-level spell slot, the
duration is concentration, up to 1 hour. When you
use a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the duration is
concentration, up to 8 hours.
=== SPELL END ===

=== SPELL START ===
Name: BLOOD ARMOR
Level: 3
School: Necromancy
Casting Time: 1 bonus action
Range: Self
Components: V, S (you must have just struck a foe with a
Duration: 1 hour
Description:
melee weapon)
When you strike a foe with a melee weapon attack, you can
immediately cast blood armor as a bonus action. The foe you
struck must contain blood; if the target doesn’t bleed, the
spell ends without effect. The blood flowing from your foe
magically increases in volume and forms a suit of armor
around you, granting you an Armor Class of 18 + your
Dexterity modifier for the spell’s duration. This armor has
no Strength requirement, doesn’t hinder spellcasting, and
doesn’t incur disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.
If the creature you struck was a celestial, blood armor also
grants you advantage on Charisma saving throws for the
duration of the spell.
=== SPELL END ===

=== SPELL START ===
Name: BLOOD LURE
Level: 2
School: Enchantment
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 10 feet
Components: V, S, M (a container or pool of blood)
Duration: 1 minute
Description:
You point at any location (a jar, a bowl, even a puddle)
within range that contains at least a pint of blood. Each
creature that feeds on blood and is within 60 feet of
that location must make a Charisma saving throw. (This
includes undead, such as vampires.) A creature that has
Keen Smell or any similar scent-boosting ability has
disadvantage on the saving throw, while undead have
advantage on the saving throw. On a failed save, the
creature is attracted to the blood and must move toward it
unless impeded.
Once an affected creature reaches the blood, it tries to
consume it, foregoing all other actions while the blood is
present. A successful attack against an affected creature
ends the effect, as does the consumption of the blood,
which requires an action by an affected creature.
=== SPELL END ===

=== SPELL START ===
Name: BLOOD PUPPET
Level: 4
School: Transmutation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 100 feet
Components: V, M (a drop of blood from the target)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Description:
With a sample of its blood, you are able to magically
control a creature’s actions, like a marionette on magical
strings. Choose a creature you can see within range
whose blood you hold. The target must succeed on a
Constitution saving throw, or you gain control over its
physical activity (as long as you interact with the blood
material component each round). As a bonus action on
your turn, you can direct the creature to perform various
activities. You can specify a simple and general course of
action, such as, “Attack that creature,” “Run over there,”
or, “Fetch that object.” If the creature completes the order
and doesn’t receive further direction from you, it defends
and preserves itself to the best of its ability. The target is
aware of being controlled. At the end of each of its turns,
the target can make another Constitution saving throw.
On a success, the spell ends.
=== SPELL END ===

=== SPELL START ===
Name: BLOOD SCARAB
Level: 1
School: Necromancy
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 30 feet
Components: V, M (a drop of the caster’s blood, and the
Duration: Instantaneous
Description:
exoskeleton of a scarab beetle)
Your blood is absorbed into the beetle’s exoskeleton
to form a beautiful, rubylike scarab that flies toward a
creature of your choice within range. The target must
make a successful Constitution saving throw or take 1d6
necrotic damage. You gain temporary hit points equal to
the necrotic damage dealt.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the number of scarabs
increases by one for each slot level above 1st. You can
direct the scarabs at the same target or at different targets.
Each target makes a single saving throw, regardless of the
number of scarabs targeting it.
=== SPELL END ===

=== SPELL START ===
Name: BLOOD SPOOR
Level: 4
School: Divination
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self
Components: V, S, M (a drop of the quarry’s blood)
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
Description:
By touching a drop of your quarry’s blood (spilled or
drawn within the past hour), you can follow the creature’s
trail unerringly across any surface or under water, no
matter how fast you are moving. If your quarry takes
flight, you can follow its trail along the ground—or
through the air, if you have the means to fly.
If your quarry moves magically (such as by way of a
dimension door or a teleport spell), you sense its trail as a
straight path leading from where the magical movement
started to where it ended. Such a route might lead through
lethal or impassable barriers. This spell even reveals the
route of a creature using pass without trace, but it fails to
locate a creature protected by nondetection or by other
effects that prevent scrying spells or cause divination spells
to fail. If your quarry moves to another plane, its trail ends
without trace, but blood spoor picks up the trail again if the
caster moves to the same plane as the quarry before the
spell’s duration expires.
=== SPELL END ===

=== SPELL START ===
Name: BLOOD TIDE
Level: cantrip
School: Necromancy
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 25 feet
Components: V
Duration: 4 rounds
Description:
When you cast this spell, a creature you designate within
range must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or
bleed from its nose, eyes, ears, and mouth. This bleeding
deals no damage but imposes a –2 penalty on the creature’s
Intelligence, Charisma, and Wisdom checks. Blood tide has
no effect on undead or constructs.
A bleeding creature might attract the attention of
creatures such as stirges, sharks, or giant mosquitoes,
depending on the circumstances.
A cure wounds spell stops the bleeding before the duration
of blood tide expires, as does a successful DC 10 Wisdom
(Medicine) check.
The spell’s duration increases to 2 minutes when you
reach 5th level, to 10 minutes when you reach 11th level,
and to 1 hour when you reach 17th level.
=== SPELL END ===

=== SPELL START ===
Name: BLOODSHOT
Level: 2
School: Conjuration
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 30 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous
Description:
You launch a jet of boiling blood from your eyes at a
creature within range. You take 1d6 necrotic damage and
make a ranged spell attack against the target. If the attack
hits, the target takes 2d10 fire damage plus 2d8 psychic
damage.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the fire damage increases
by 1d10 for each slot level above 2nd.
=== SPELL END ===

=== SPELL START ===
Name: BLOODY HANDS
Level: 1
School: Necromancy
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 30 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Description:
You cause the hands (or other appropriate body parts,
such as claws or tentacles) of a creature within range to
bleed profusely. The target must succeed on a Constitution
saving throw or take 1 necrotic damage each round and
suffer disadvantage on all melee and ranged attack rolls
that require the use of its hands for the spell’s duration.
Casting any spell that has somatic or material
components while under the influence of this spell requires
a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save,
the spell is not cast but it is not lost; the casting can be
attempted again in the next round.
=== SPELL END ===

=== SPELL START ===
Name: BLOODY SMITE
Level: 1
School: Necromancy
Casting Time: 1 bonus action
Range: Self
Components: V
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Description:
The next time during the spell’s duration that you hit
a creature with a melee weapon attack, your weapon
pulses with a dull red light, and the attack deals an extra
1d6 necrotic damage to the target. Until the spell ends,
the target must make a Constitution saving throw at the
start of each of its turns. On a failed save, it takes 1d6
necrotic damage, it bleeds profusely from the mouth, and
it can’t speak intelligibly or cast spells that have a verbal
component. On a successful save, the spell ends. If the
target or an ally within 5 feet of it uses an action to tend the
wound and makes a successful Wisdom (Medicine) check
against your spell save DC, or if the target receives magical
healing, the spell ends.
=== SPELL END ===

=== SPELL START ===
Name: BOILING BLOOD
Level: 4
School: Necromancy
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 30 feet
Components: V, S, M (a vial of blood)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Description:
You cause the blood within a creature’s body to boil with
supernatural heat. Choose one creature that you can see
within range that isn’t a construct or an undead. The target
must make a Constitution saving throw. On a successful
save, it takes 2d6 fire damage and the spell ends. On a failed
save, the creature takes 4d6 fire damage and is blinded. At
the end of each of its turns, the target can make another
Constitution saving throw. On a success, the spell ends.
On a failure, the creature takes an additional 2d6 fire
damage and remains blinded.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell
slot of 5th level or higher, you can target one additional
creature for each slot level above 4th. The creatures must be
within 30 feet of each other when you target them.
=== SPELL END ===

=== SPELL START ===
Name: CAUSTIC BLOOD
Level: 2
School: Transmutation
Casting Time: 1 reaction, which you take when an
Range: Self (30-foot radius)
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous
Description:
enemy’s attack deals piercing or slashing damage to you
Your blood becomes caustic when exposed to the air.
When you take piercing or slashing damage, you can use
your reaction to select up to three creatures within 30 feet
of you. Each target takes 1d10 acid damage unless it makes
a successful Dexterity saving throw.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the number of targets
increases by one for each slot level above 2nd, to a
maximum of six targets.
=== SPELL END ===

=== SPELL START ===
Name: CRUOR OF VISIONS
Level: 5
School: Divination
Casting Time: 1 minute
Range: Self
Components: V, S, M (a bone needle and a catch basin)
Duration: Concentration, up to 5 minutes
Description:
You prick your finger with a bone needle as you cast this
spell, taking 1 necrotic damage. This drop of blood must
be caught in a container, such as a platter or a bowl, where
it grows into a pool 1 foot in diameter. This pool acts as a
crystal ball for the purpose of scrying.
If you place a drop (or dried flakes) of another creature’s
blood in the container, the creature has disadvantage on
any Wisdom saving throw to resist scrying. Additionally,
you can treat the pool of blood as a crystal ball of telepathy.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
spell slot of 7th level or higher, the pool of blood acts as
either a crystal ball of mind reading or a crystal ball of true
seeing (your choice when the spell is cast).
=== SPELL END ===

=== SPELL START ===
Name: EXSANGUINATE
Level: 5
School: Necromancy
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 30 feet
Components: V, S, M (a desiccated horse heart)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Description:
You cause the body of a creature within range to become
engorged with blood or ichor. The target must make a
Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, it takes
2d6 bludgeoning damage. On a failed save, it takes 4d6
bludgeoning damage each round, it is incapacitated, and it
cannot speak, as it vomits up torrents of blood or ichor. In
addition, its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount
equal to the damage taken. The target dies if this effect
reduces its hit point maximum to 0.
At the end of each of its turns, a creature can make a
Constitution saving throw, ending the effect on a success—
except for the reduction of its hit point maximum, which
lasts until the creature finishes a long rest.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell
slot of 6th level or higher, you can target one additional
creature for each slot level above 5th.
=== SPELL END ===

=== SPELL START ===
Name: EXSANGUINATING CLOUD
Level: 5
School: Necromancy
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 100 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 5 minutes
Description:
When you cast this spell, a rose-colored mist billows up in
a 20-foot radius, centered on a point you indicate within
range, making the area heavily obscured and draining
blood from living creatures in the cloud. The cloud spreads
around corners. It lasts for the duration or until strong
wind disperses it, ending the spell.
This cloud leaches the blood or similar fluid from
creatures in the area. It doesn’t affect undead or constructs.
Any creature in the cloud when it’s created or at the start of
your turn takes 6d6 necrotic damage and gains one level of
exhaustion; a successful Constitution saving throw halves
the damage and prevents the exhaustion.
=== SPELL END ===

=== SPELL START ===
Name: SANGUINE HORROR
Level: 5
School: Conjuration
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 5 feet
Components: V, S, M (a miniature dagger)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour
Description:
When you cast this spell, you prick yourself with the
material component, taking 1 piercing damage. The spell
fails if this damage is prevented or negated in any way.
From the drop of blood, you conjure a blood elemental
(Creature Codex, p. 138). The blood elemental is friendly to
you and your companions for the duration. It disappears
when it’s reduced to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.
Roll initiative for the elemental, which has its own turns.
It obeys verbal commands from you (no action required
by you). If you don’t issue any commands to the blood
elemental, it defends itself but otherwise takes no actions.
If your concentration is broken, the blood elemental
doesn’t disappear, but you lose control of it and it becomes
hostile to you and your companions. An uncontrolled
blood elemental cannot be dismissed by you, and it
disappears 1 hour after you summoned it.
=== SPELL END ===

=== SPELL START ===
Name: STANCH
Level: 1
School: Transmutation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 hour
Description:
The target’s blood coagulates rapidly, so that a dying target
stabilizes and any ongoing bleeding or wounding effect on
the target ends. The target can’t be the source of blood for
any spell or effect that requires even a drop of blood.
3rd-level transmutation (ritual) (blood)
Casting Time: 10 minutes
Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Duration: 24 hours
You mark an unattended magic item (including weapons
and armor) with a clearly visible stain of your blood. The
exact appearance of the bloodstain is up to you. The item’s
magical abilities don’t function for anyone else as long as
the bloodstain remains on it. For example, a +1 flaming
longsword with a vital mark functions as a nonmagical
longsword in the hands of anyone but the caster, but it still
functions as a +1 flaming longsword for the caster who placed
the bloodstain on it. A wand of magic missiles would be no
more than a stick in the hands of anyone but the caster.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
spell slot of 4th level or higher on the same item for 28
consecutive days, the effect becomes permanent until
dispelled.
=== SPELL END ===

=== SPELL START ===
Name: WEAPON OF BLOOD
Level: 1
School: Transmutation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self
Components: V, S, M (a pinch of iron shavings)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour
Description:
When you cast this spell, you inflict 1d4 slashing damage
on yourself that can’t be healed until after the blade created
by this spell is destroyed or the spell ends. The trickling
blood transforms into a dagger of red metal that functions
as a +1 dagger.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell
slot of 3rd to 5th level, the self-inflicted wound deals 3d4
slashing damage and the spell produces a +2 dagger. When
you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th to 8th level, the
self-inflicted wound deals 6d4 slashing damage and the
spell produces a +2 dagger of wounding. When you cast this
spell using a 9th-level spell slot, the self-inflicted wound
deals 9d4 slashing damage and the spell produces a +3
dagger of wounding.
Some sorcerers are preoccupied with blood, both their own
and that of others.
The serophage learns early in life that they can exercise
some control over their own blood, and they harness
that ability to awaken the magic that flows through their
veins. The dark possibilities of this form of magic become
apparent when a sorcerer discovers that they can control
the blood flowing in the veins of other creatures, too. Thus
is born the serophage, a sorcerer unlike all others.
At 1st level, someone who chooses this origin gains control
over his or her blood flow, directing it away from a recent
wound. When the serophage takes bludgeoning damage,
he or she rolls a d4 and subtracts the result from the
damage taken. When he or she reaches 6th level, the die
increases to a d6.
Starting at 6th level, instead of taking a move action, a
serophage can deal 1d4 slashing damage to him- or herself
and regain a number of sorcery points equal to the slashing
damage. Alternatively, the serophage can choose to increase
the save DC or the attack bonus of the next spell he or she
casts by +1 instead of regaining sorcery points. When the
serophage reaches 12th level, the die becomes a d8 and the
increase to his or her attack bonus or save DC becomes +2.
At 14th level, a serophage gains the ability to draw blood
from a creature with Intelligence 5 or higher that has been
killed within the last 30 minutes and form it into swirling
rings that surround the sorcerer. The number of rings is
equal to his or her Charisma modifier.
The rings absorb physical damage. When the serophage
is struck by a melee or ranged weapon attack, one ring
absorbs 1d10 damage from the attack, and then disappears
in a splash.
As an action, the serophage can cause one ring to form
into a magical spear of blood and launch itself at a target
he or she selects within 60 feet. The sorcerer makes a
ranged spell attack. On a hit, the target takes piercing
damage equal to 1d6 + the serophage’s Charisma modifier
and must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be
stunned until the start of the serophage’s next turn. The
spear is considered a magic weapon. It evaporates after
it’s expended. Each ring remains until it either absorbs
damage or is expended as a weapon.
At 18th level, a serophage gains the ability to siphon a
steady stream of blood from a living creature at a distance.
As an action, he or she designates a creature within 40 feet;
that creature must make a Constitution saving throw. On
a failed save, the creature takes 2d6 necrotic damage as
blood oozes through its skin and flows through the air to
the serophage, who absorbs it through their own skin. For
every 2 points of damage dealt to the target, the serophage
chooses to regain either 1 hit point or 1 sorcery point. The
siphoning continues, dealing damage and restoring hit
points or sorcery points at the start of the serophage’s turn,
until he or she ends the effect (no action required), or until
the target makes a successful Constitution saving throw at
the end of its turn.
Blood can be a dark and forbidden source of magical
energy for those willing to makes the necessary sacrifices.
A blood mage powers their magic with the secrets they
learn from their own blood. Eventually, they learn to
manipulate the blood of others, too.
Beginning at 2nd level, the gold and time a blood mage
must spend to copy a blood magic spell into their spellbook
is halved.
A blood mage has proficiency in Medicine.
At 2nd level, a blood mage gains a greater awareness of
the blood flowing through their veins and of the heart that
pumps it, and some measure of control over both. When
the blood mage is subjected to a disease or poison effect
that allows a Constitution saving throw to take only half
damage, they instead take no damage on a successful save,
and only half damage on a failed one.
A blood mage of 6th level or higher can see a moment of the
past through the eyes of a creature by consuming its blood.
Upon ingesting a small amount of the blood of another
creature, the wizard becomes stunned. While stunned, he
or she experiences one of the creature’s memories through
its own eyes. (The memory may or may not be about the
incident that caused it to bleed.)
Once a blood mage has consumed a creature’s blood for
this purpose, the creature is immune to further uses of this
ability.
A blood mage of 10th level or higher can absorb a poison or
a disease from another creature, living or dead, and turn it
to his or her use. By exposing a fresh wound to a source of
disease or poison, the wizard can safely absorb it and store
it, dormant, in his or her bloodstream. The blood mage
can then inflict the disease or poison on another creature
by spitting a stream of blood at it. As an action, the wizard
makes a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the target is exposed
to the disease or poison and must proceed with any saving
throws required.
If the wizard does not pass the disease or poison along
to another living creature within three days, it becomes
active in the body, and the wizard must make the first
two saving throws required by the disease or poison with
disadvantage.
A blood mage of 14th level or higher can turn another
creature’s blood into sludge, hampering the creature, or
can thin it out, giving the creature extra mobility. As an
action, the wizard can cause a touched creature that fails a
Constitution saving throw to become affected as if by a slow
spell—or, alternatively, to gain the effect of a haste spell. The
duration of either effect is a number of rounds equal to the
blood mage’s Intelligence modifier. The target of the haste
effect can intentionally fail the saving throw.
The blood mage can use this ability once, regaining the
use of it upon finishing a long rest.
Fiendish MagicAny mortal in the world can be evil by choice, or can be
forced into performing evil acts. The same cannot be said
for certain denizens of other planes, particularly demons
and devils. These fiends are not only innately evil—no
choice about it for them, no forcing needed—but also the
very personification of evil.
Some spellcasters take up the practice of a certain
kind of magic that enables them to emulate or interact
with those fiends, or to protect themselves from being
annihlated by the evil creatures they revere. The largest
repertoire of fiendish magic belongs to evil wizards, but
like-minded clerics, sorcerers, and warlocks can also
traffic in these spells.

Name: AURA OF WRATH
Level: 6
School: Enchantment
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self (20-foot radius)
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Description:
You surround yourself with a psychic aura that drives
creatures within 20 feet of you into a violent frenzy. A
creature inside the aura or that enters the aura must
succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be overcome with
rage. A creature overcome with rage must take its next
action to attack the nearest possible target —if more than
one target is available, choose randomly. The creature
uses a melee weapon if it has one; otherwise, it attacks
with any other offensive ability it possesses. If an affected
creature leaves the aura, the aura’s effect persists for 1
round afterward. A creature affected by the aura makes a
new saving throw at the start of each of its turns, ending
the effect on itself on a success. Once a creature makes a
successful save, that creature cannot be affected again by
the same aura.
If a creature affected by your aura hits you with an attack
that targets you, the creature takes 4d8 psychic damage.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
spell slot of 7th level or higher, creatures that leave the
aura remain under the effect of the spell for 1 additional
round for each slot level above 6th. Also, the damage an
affected creature takes from striking you increases by 2d8
for each slot level above 6th.

=== SPELL START ===
Name: CHAINS OF PERDITION
Level: 3
School: Conjuration
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S, M (a few links of iron chain)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Description:
Lengths of iron chain appear near a creature you choose
within range, possibly ensnaring the target and causing
it physical and mental suffering. The targeted creature
must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be restrained
by the chains and take 2d8 bludgeoning damage and 2d8
psychic damage. The creature takes this damage on your
turn every round that it remains restrained by the chains.
On its turn, a restrained creature can make a Strength or
Dexterity check (its choice) against your spell save DC. On
a success, it frees itself.
The chains remain until the spell ends. If they are not
restraining a creature, you can use a bonus action to direct
the chains to target the same creature or another one,
moving the chains up to 20 feet (within the range of the
spell) if necessary to do so. If the chains move beyond
the maximum range, the spell ends. The chains can be
destroyed; treat them as an object with AC 18, 15 hit
points, resistance to piercing damage, and immunity to
poison damage and psychic damage.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
spell slot of 4th level or higher, the spell deals an extra 1d8
bludgeoning damage and 1d8 psychic damage for every
two slot levels above 3rd.

Name: CHANNEL FIENDISH POWER
Level: 5
School: Transmutation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self
Components: V, S, M (an amulet inscribed with a
Duration: 10 minutes
Description:
demonic or diabolic symbol)
You infuse yourself with dark power from the Lower
Planes, which grants you magical gifts for a short time.
While this spell is in effect, your body takes on minor
fiendish characteristics: scales, a reddish or greenish hue
to your skin, small horns protruding from your forehead,
or other such features. While the spell is in effect, you gain
two of the following abilities:
• Darkvision with a range of 120 feet, unimpeded by
magical darkness.
• Immunity to fire damage.
• Immunity to poison damage and the poisoned
condition.
• Advantage on saving throws against spells and other
magical effects.
• Resistance to one of the following damage types: cold,
fire, or lightning.
• Resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing
damage from weapons that aren’t silvered.
• Resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing
damage from nonmagical weapons.
• Claws that grant you a melee weapon attack that deals
1d8 slashing damage.
• Wings that grant you a flying speed of 60 feet.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 6th level or higher, you can choose one
additional benefit to be granted by the spell for each slot
level above 5th.

=== SPELL START ===
Name: CLOAK OF FIENDISH MENACE
Level: 2
School: Transmutation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Personal
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Description:
You wrap yourself in an aura of fiendish power,
intimidating those that face you. When a creature is within
5 feet of you, it must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a
failed save, the creature becomes frightened. A frightened
creature can make another saving throw at the start of
each of its turns. On a successful saving throw, the creature
is no longer frightened and cannot again be affected by this
particular casting of the spell.
If you deal damage to a creature that is frightened by
this spell, it must take the Dash action and move away
from you by the safest available route on its next turn,
unless there is nowhere to move. The creature is unable to
move toward you again while the spell is in effect, unless it
makes a successful saving throw against the spell.

Name: CONJURE FIENDS
Level: 4
School: Conjuration
Casting Time: 1 minute
Range: 90 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour
Description:
You summon fiends that appear in unoccupied spaces that
you can see within range. You choose one of the following
options for what appears:
• One fiend of challenge rating 2 or lower
• Two fiends of challenge rating 1 or lower
• Four fiends of challenge rating 1/2 or lower
• Eight fiends of challenge rating 1/4 or lower
A fiend summoned by this spell disappears when it drops
to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.
The summoned creatures are friendly to you and your
companions. Roll initiative for the summoned creatures
as a group, which has its own turns. They obey any verbal
commands that you issue to them (no action required
by you). If you don’t issue any commands to them, they
defend themselves from hostile creatures, but otherwise
take no actions.
The GM has the creatures’ statistics.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using
certain higher-level spell slots, you choose one of the
summoning options above, and more creatures appear:
twice as many with a 6th-level spell slot and three times as
many with an 8th-level spell slot.
=== SPELL END ===

=== SPELL START ===
Name: CONJURE NIGHTMARE
Level: 5
School: Conjuration
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S, M (brimstone and a torch)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour
Description:
You call forth a nightmare to serve you. The creature
appears in an unoccupied space you choose within range.
The nightmare will serve you as a mount, in combat and
out. The nightmare is friendly to you and your companions
for the duration, and follows any commands you issue to
it. If your concentration is broken, the nightmare is no
longer bound by the spell. It might leave immediately,
especially if it has been wounded or threatened, but it is
just as likely to attack you or an ally, or otherwise gain
retribution for being summoned and bound to your
service. If you provide the nightmare with a sacrifice it
can devour when it is first summoned, it will be appeased
enough to simply return home once the spell ends,
without causing harm to you or your companions.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
spell slot of 6th level or higher, the duration increases by 1
hour for each slot level above 5th.
DARK LORD’S MANTLE
=== SPELL END ===

=== SPELL START ===
Name: DARK LORD’S MANTLE
Level: 5
School: Enchantment
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self (30-foot radius)
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
Description:
You infuse yourself with fiendish power, which inspires
your allies and intimidates your foes. While the spell lasts,
you exude confidence. You gain advantage on saving
throws against all enchantment spells and effects. In
addition, each ally within 30 feet of you can roll a d4 once
per round and add the result to an attack roll as a bonus
action, or to a saving throw as a reaction.
An enemy that starts its turn within 30 feet of you, or
that moves within 30 feet of you on its turn, must succeed
on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you.
If a creature moves out of the spell’s radius, it remains
frightened until the start of its next turn, and then the spell
ends for that creature. While frightened in this way, the
creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its
turns. On a success, the creature is no longer frightened,
and it cannot be affected again by your casting of this spell
for 24 hours.
=== SPELL END ===

=== SPELL START ===
Name: DEMON WITHIN
Level: 3
School: Conjuration
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 30 feet
Components: V, S, M (a vial of blood from a humanoid
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Description:
killed within the previous 24 hours)
One humanoid of your choice within range becomes a
gateway for a demon to enter the plane of existence you
are on. You choose the demon’s type from among those
of challenge rating of 4 or lower. The target must make a
Wisdom saving throw. On a success, the gateway fails to
open, and the spell has no effect. On a failed save, the target
takes 4d6 force damage from the demon’s attempt to claw
its way through the gate. For the spell’s duration, you can
use a bonus action to further agitate the demon, dealing an
additional 2d6 force damage to the target each time.
If the target drops to 0 hit points while affected by this
spell, the demon tears through the body and appears in
the same space as its now incapacitated or dead victim.
You do not control this demon; it is free to either attack or
leave the area as it chooses. The demon disappears after 24
hours or when it drops to 0 hit points.
=== SPELL END ===

=== SPELL START ===
Name: FIENDISH BRAND
Level: 5
School: Necromancy
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M (a branding iron)
Duration: 7 days
Description:
You infuse a branding iron (typically one bearing the mark
of a demon lord or a lord of Hell) with the bone-chilling
cold of the Lower Planes and a promise of damnation. To
mark a creature with the brand, you make a melee spell
attack. On a hit, you deal 2d8 cold damage to the target
and cause it to become branded. The damage can be healed
normally, but the brand remains until a remove curse spell
is cast on the target, the duration expires, or you use an
action to remove the brand. You can remove the brand
from any distance, as long as the branded creature is on
the same plane of existence as you.
While the creature wears the brand, it has disadvantage
on any saving throws it makes against spells you cast on it.
If you try to locate the creature with a scrying spell, it takes
the –10 penalty to its saving throw as if you possessed a
lock of its hair or other body part.
MAMMON’S AVARICE
=== SPELL END ===

=== SPELL START ===
Name: MAMMON’S AVARICE
Level: 1
School: Divination
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self (30-foot radius)
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
Description:
By casting this spell, you tap into the power of greed that
is Mammon’s sphere of influence, which manifests as a
heightened olfactory sense. You can pinpoint, by smell,
the location of any precious metals or gemstones within
30 feet of you. If you find anything, you can use an action
to determine the exact types and amounts of any such
materials. If materials of this sort are completely enclosed
by, or separated from you by, more than 6 feet of earth or
wood, 2 feet of stone, or 2 inches of common metal, you
cannot detect them even if they are in range.
=== SPELL END ===

=== SPELL START ===
Name: NEST OF INFERNAL VIPERS
Level: 3
School: Conjuration
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour
Description:
You summon evil spirits that take the form of a swarm of
poisonous snakes and appear in an unoccupied space you
can see within range. The swarm of snakes is considered a
fiend as well as a beast. It has resistance to fire damage, and
lasts until it drops to 0 hit points or the spell ends.
The summoned swarm is friendly to you and your
companions. Roll initiative for the swarm, which takes
its own turns. It obeys any verbal commands you issue
to it (no action required by you). If you don’t issue any
commands to the swarm, it moves to attack the nearest
creature that is not your ally.
The GM has the creature’s statistics.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using
certain higher-level spell slots, you can summon additional
swarms. You summon two swarms with a 5th-level spell
slot, three swarms with a 7th-level spell slot, or four
swarms with a 9th-level spell slot.
=== SPELL END ===

=== SPELL START ===
Name: PLAGUEBEARER
Level: 2
School: Abjuration
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Duration: 48 hours
Description:
The creature you touch when casting this spell becomes
immune to disease for the duration. The creature can still
contract and carry diseases; it simply does not suffer any
effects of a disease. When exposed to a disease, the creature
must make the saving throw required. If the saving throw
fails, the creature becomes a carrier of the disease, and
might expose others to it per the rules for the particular
affliction. The creature under the effect of the spell is aware
when it becomes infected. If the creature recovers from or
is cured of all diseases it suffers while this spell is in effect, it
continues to benefit from the spell until the spell ends.
When the duration expires, the target becomes
susceptible to the effect of any disease it is still carrying, as
if it had just now contracted it.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell
slot of 3rd level or higher, the duration increases by 24
hours for each slot level above 2nd.
=== SPELL END ===

=== SPELL START ===
Name: TOME CURSE
Level: 4
School: Necromancy
Casting Time: 10 minutes
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M (an ounce of blood, and powdered
Duration: Until dispelled or triggered
Description:
onyx worth at least 50 gp, both of which the spell
consumes)
You protect a book by writing a curse in it with ink made
from the material components of this spell. The writing
is typically a couplet or a quatrain that warns of the
consequences of disturbing your property. The curse is
triggered by an action or actions that you specify (which
typically involves someone reading the book without
permission, trying to damage the book, or trying to steal
it). When the curse is triggered, the creature that did so
must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or suffer its
effect. You can choose one of the effects described in the
bestow curse spell, or you can affect the target in one of the
following ways:
• While the target is cursed, it is blinded.
• Beasts are unusually hostile to the target while it is
cursed; they gain advantage on attack rolls against the
target.
• While cursed, the target is an attractive mark to
pickpockets and other thieves, and such individuals
will try to steal the target’s valuables when the
opportunity presents itself. (Even if in the target’s
possession, the cursed book does not count as one of
the target’s valuables.)
• A cursed target that either receives magical healing
or rolls Hit Dice to recover hit points after a long rest
must roll twice and use the lower result.
A remove curse spell ends this effect. You can also stipulate
other actions taken by the target that would nullify the
curse (returning the book after it is stolen, for example).

=== SPELL START ===
Name: WAVE OF CORRUPTION
Level: 3
School: Necromancy
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 30 feet
Components: V, S, M (a scrap of rotten meat or plant
Duration: Instantaneous
Description:
matter)
When you cast this spell, necromantic energy spreads
out in a 30-foot radius around you, corrupting what it
comes into contact with. Each unattended, nonmagical
object within range takes 3d8 necrotic damage. All food
and drink in the area, other than what is being carried, is
fouled and made unpalatable. Magic consumables, such
as potions, have a 50 percent chance of being ruined,
but any such item in the possession of a creature gets a
Constitution saving throw using the owner’s save bonus
to avoid this outcome.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the necrotic damage
increases by 1d8 for every two slot levels above 3rd.
Some individuals are willing to do anything in exchange
for power. They delve into forbidden knowledge to
expand their command of magic—trafficking with fiends
and endangering their immortal soul in exchange for
arcane might.
Beings of the Lower Planes dangle promises of power
as bait, hoping to lure careless folk into their clutches.
Some of those who take the bait have a keen intellect,
enabling them to use careful planning that circumvents
this damnation—or at least delays it. In this way, power-
hungry mages strike bargains and increase their magical
might with the knowledge the fiends offer. A master of
fiends, as these individuals are called, is either a diabolist
(one who deals with devils) or a demonologist (one who
traffics with demons). Most common folk care little about
the distinction, seeing both simply as servants of evil, but
the differences between the two are significant. Diabolists
are masters of language and context, knowing that the
contracts proffered by devils are complex and meant to
mislead, and must be read carefully and fully understood
so as to avoid any trickery. Demons have little use for
subtlety; they understand and respect only one thing—
power. A demonologist must have the magical power to
compel such fiends to do their bidding, or they will surely
be rent asunder and have their soul carried screaming back
to the Abyss by the demon. Either path takes a person
willing to risk their immortal soul in the pursuit of power,
and few dare to do so.
Beginning at 2nd level, you gain a bonus spell you can copy
to your spellbook at half the cost. You gain a new spell at
each level indicated on the following list if you have not
already learned the spell. You acquire knowledge of these
spells through your trafficking with fiends.
When you attain the appropriate wizard level, add the
indicated spell to your spellbook: 2nd level, hellish rebuke;
4th level, enthrall; 6th level, nest of infernal vipers; 8th level,
conjure fiends; 10th level, channel fiendish power; 12th level,
aura of wrath; 14th level, plane shift; 16th level, dominate
monster; and 18th level, imprisonment.
At 2nd level, you develop a dark aura of either allure or
menace. You gain proficiency in Deception, Intimidation,
or Persuasion. You can bring this talent to the fore to gain
advantage on a single check using the chosen skill. Once
you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a
short or long rest.
Due to your dealings with fiends, your soul is damned, and
after your death it is collected by the fiends with whom
you bargained. Such creatures do not give up their prizes
willingly. Starting when you reach 2nd level, a caster using
a spell to return you to life must make a DC 12 Wisdom
saving throw. The DC of this save increases by 1 for every
five levels you gain hereafter, to a maximum of DC 15 at
17th level. On a successful save, your soul is retrieved and
the spell works normally. On a failed save, the spell ends
and you remain dead. (The GM can opt to allow either you
or the caster trying to revive you to strike a bargain that
allows you to be raised. The details of this deal are left up to
the GM, but typically such bargaining involves extremely
valuable items, magic, and—especially—souls
Tradition states that the devil awaits at the crossroads,
looking to bargain with those who seek to sell their souls
for glory. When you reach 6th level, you can achieve contact
with the lower realms in less dramatic circumstances. For
you, any significant liminal space—the threshold between
one space and another, such as the edge of a forest, the
entrance to a cave, or the doorway leading from a church to
its graveyard —will do. In such a place, you can perform a
ritual that summons a dark spirit from beyond, a shadowy
form that will offer you power for power.
When you do so, you can expend a number of spell slots
(equal to your wizard level or lower) in exchange for a pool
of an equal number of dice that you can use in one of two
ways. You can spend one or more dice as an action on your
turn to heal yourself, regaining 1d8 hit points for every die
you spend. Or you can spend one or more dice to boost
the damage of a spell you cast. Each die you spend adds an
additional die of damage to a spell you cast, of the same
size used in the spell (d6s for fireball, for example).
Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until
you finish a long rest. Any unused dice in the pool are lost
when you rest, and you regain your normal number of
spell slots after the rest.
When you reach 10th level, you have learned to enhance
your magic to provide you with greater benefit against
extraplanar threats. You are protected not only against
attack or betrayal by fiends, but by celestials that would see
you judged for your connection with darkness. You have
advantage on any saving throws against spells and abilities
of celestials or fiends that would cause you to become
charmed, frightened, paralyzed, restrained, stunned, or
possessed by such a creature.
Additionally, if you have the dispel evil and good spell
prepared and a celestial or a fiend attacks you, you can cast
that spell as a reaction. Once you do so, you can’t use this
additional benefit again until you finish a long rest.
Starting at 14th level, when you cast a magic circle spell that
affects fiends, such creatures have disadvantage on any
Charisma saving throws made in an attempt to enter or
leave the cylinder by teleportation or interplanar travel. In
addition, any fiend you summon with a conjuration spell
gains 13 temporary hit points.
Void MagicVoid magic comprises a dangerous offshoot of wizardry
that exists in the shadows of the more well-known
practices. This form of magic is anathema to existence
itself, making it difficult to master and dangerous even
to study. Dabblers rarely produce effects more profound
than minor injury, property damage, and psychological
scars to themselves and those around them. More serious
investigations into Void magic can spell disaster. Only alien
creatures whose psychology and physiology defy human
understanding seem capable of commanding Void magic
with relative ease; even beings as anomalous as aboleths
respect and fear the power of Void magic.
A Void spell can never be added to a wizard’s spellbook as
one of the two free spells obtained for gaining a level. To
learn a Void magic spell, a wizard must find an NPC who is
willing to impart the knowledge, or else discover the spell
written on a scroll, in a captured spellbook, or carved on a
temple wall, or find it in some other form of recorded lore.
Alternatively, if the GM allows it, a character who sees and
hears a Void magic spell being cast can add it to his or her
spellbook, using the same rules as for transcribing a spell
from a scroll.
Despite the unique origin of Void magic, it still functions
similarly to other arcane magic on a fundamental level.
Void magic follows all the normal rules for spellcasting and
is susceptible to dispelling, counterspelling, and antimagic
as normal.
Void Speech. Every Void spell has a verbal
component—an utterance in the dark syllables of Void
Speech—and can’t, under any circumstances, be cast by
someone who cannot speak it. The written form of Void
Speech is used to create Void glyphs, which are involved in
the casting of some Void spells.
Void magic as a practice and form is entirely the province
of wizards. Warlocks, bards, and other casters seem unable
to master the complex language and arcana associated
with it, which demands intense focus and study.

Name: CONJURE MINOR VOIDBORN
Level: 5
School: Conjuration
Casting Time: 1 minute
Range: 90 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour
Description:
You summon fiends or aberrations that appear in
unoccupied spaces you can see within range. You choose
one of the following options:
• One creature of challenge rating 2 or lower
• Two creatures of challenge rating 1 or lower
• Four creatures of challenge rating 1/2 or lower
• Eight creatures of challenge rating 1/4 or lower
Summoned creatures disappear when they drop to 0 hit
points or when the spell ends.
The summoned creatures do not directly attack you
or your companions. Roll initiative for the summoned
creatures as a group; they take their own turns on their
initiative result. They attack your enemies and try to stay
within 90 feet of you, but they control their own actions.
The summoned creatures despise being bound, so they
might harm or impede you and your companions with
secondary effects (but not direct attacks) if the opportunity
arises. At the beginning of the creatures’ turn, you can use
your reaction to verbally command them. They obey your
commands on that turn, and you take 1d6 psychic damage
at the end of the turn.
If your concentration is broken, the spell ends but the
creatures don’t disappear. Instead, you can no longer
command them, and they become hostile to you and your
companions. They will attack you and your allies if they
believe they have a chance to win the fight or to inflict
meaningful harm, but they won’t fight if they fear it would
mean their own death. You can’t dismiss the creatures, but
they disappear 1 hour after being summoned.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 7th-
or 9th-level spell slot, you choose one of the summoning
options above, and more creatures appear—twice as many
with a 7th-level spell slot and three times as many with a
9th-level spell slot.

Description:
You summon a fiend or aberration of challenge rating 6 or
lower, which appears in an unoccupied space that you can
see within range. The creature disappears when it drops to
0 hit points or when the spell ends.
Roll initiative for the creature, which takes its own turns.
It attacks the nearest creature on its turn. At the start of
the fiend’s turn, you can use your reaction to command the
creature by speaking in Void Speech. It obeys your verbal
command, and you take 2d6 psychic damage at the end of
the creature’s turn.
If your concentration is broken, the spell ends but the
creature doesn’t disappear. Instead, you can no longer
issue commands to the fiend, and it becomes hostile to
you and your companions. It will attack you and your allies
if it believes it has a chance to win the fight or to inflict
meaningful harm, but it won’t fight if it fears doing so
would mean its own death. You can’t dismiss the creature,

Description:
You summon the cold, inky darkness of the Void into
being around a creature that you can see. The target takes
10d10 cold damage and is restrained for the duration; a
successful Constitution saving throw halves the damage
and negates the restrained condition. A restrained
creature gains one level of exhaustion at the start of each
of its turns. Creatures immune to cold and that do not
breathe do not gain exhaustion. A creature restrained in
this way can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of
its turns, ending the spell on a success.

15-foot-radius sphere centered on that point, grasping
at creatures in the area. A creature that starts its turn in
the area or that enters the area for the first time on its

You speak a hideous string of Void Speech that leaves your
mouth bloodied, causing a rift into nothingness to tear
open. The rift takes the form of a 10-foot-radius sphere,
and it forms around a point you can see within range. The
area within 40 feet of the sphere’s outer edge becomes
difficult terrain as the Void tries to draw everything into
itself. A creature that starts its turn within 40 feet of the
sphere or that enters that area for the first time on its turn
must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pulled 15
feet toward the rift. A creature that starts its turn in the
rift or that comes into contact with it for the first time on
its turn takes 8d10 necrotic damage. Creatures inside the
rift are blinded and deafened. Unattended objects within
40 feet of the rift are drawn 15 feet toward it at the start of
your turn, and they take damage as creatures if they come
into contact with it.
While concentrating on the spell, you take 2d6 necrotic

Name: WORD OF MISFORTUNE
Level: cantrip
School: Enchantment
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Description:
You hiss a word of Void Speech. Choose one creature you
can see within range. The next time the target makes a
saving throw during the spell’s duration, it must roll a d4
and subtract the result from the total of the saving throw.
The spell then ends.
The Void exists outside the realm of sanity and form.
Creatures spawned by unknown powers and processes
exist there, constantly seeking entry into the living,
physical world. More than that, the Void itself seems
almost alive, or at least under some constant pressure to
spread and expand—to consume. Creatures who taste
its power expose themselves to its touch, and that touch
is corruptive. It bears a taint that seeps into physical,
spiritual, and mental being.
Void magic is powerful and often destructive, its spells
reinforced with the blasphemous intonations of Void
Speech, and it is the most common way for mortals,
particularly adventurers, to have their first brush with the
Void’s taint. Lore and knowledge gathered from tainted
sources or the mindbending unreality of the Void itself
seep into a creature’s mind and soul. Even some places
become spiritually polluted if the barrier to the existing
world wears thin or breaks.
Void taint is a measure of how much the Void’s influence
has seeped into and corrupted a creature’s essence.
Accumulating too much Void taint causes madness and
physical debilitation.
Whenever a creature is exposed to Void taint, it risks
losing a small piece of itself to that influence. The
Void attacks the very reality of the exposed creature,
overwriting a fragment of its personal reality with a
twisted version. An exposed creature must make a
Charisma saving throw against a DC based on the severity
of the exposure, as described on the Void Exposure table.
On a successful save, the creature might be shaken or
upset by the experience, but suffers no ill effects. Once
a creature has succeeded on a saving throw against a
particular kind of Void exposure, it is unaffected by further
exposures of the same type until it finishes a long rest.

On a failed save, the creature gains 1 point of Void
taint. A creature can accumulate an amount of Void taint
equal to its proficiency bonus + its Charisma modifier
(minimum of 2 points) without harm. When a creature’s
Void taint exceeds that number, it is afflicted with a form
of indefinite madness and its Void taint total resets to 0.
To determine which type of madness emerges, refer to the
Indefinite Madness table on the following page.
Instead of bearing this scar on its psyche, a creature
can choose to channel the Void’s influence into a physical
change, known as a flesh warp. The Void can produce an
infinite variety of these effects, ranging from subtle to
terrifying; the Flesh Warps table (see ) offers a
number of possibilities. A creature that has any flesh warp
has disadvantage on Charisma checks involving a creature
not of the Void for any purpose other than intimidation.
On either the Indefinite Madness table or the Flesh
Warps table, a die roll dictates the outcome unless the
GM decides otherwise. Under no circumstances should a
player be allowed to choose a desired result.
A greater restoration spell removes 1 point of Void taint
from the target, in addition to curing the target’s
indefinite madness, if the creature succeeds on a DC 15
Charisma saving throw.
Flesh warps are permanent manifestations of the Void
within the body of a tainted creature and are incredibly
difficult to remove. A regenerate spell or more powerful
magic is required to rid a creature of a flesh warp.
Few ever catch a glimpse of the cold immensity of
the stars and the Void, and fewer still are aware of the
unfathomable powers that call such places home. Those
who see beyond the veil of the mundane often go mad as a
result of the irreconcilable clash between their conception
of the world and the reality of universal insignificance.
To learn what the Void has to teach, one must embrace its
utter indifference toward life.
Clerics who direct their reverence toward the Void
and what it represents, rather than toward a deity
or some other entity of the typical sort, can commit
wholeheartedly to this discipline by following the path
laid out in the Void domain.

* Described in this book
A cleric who adopts the Void domain gains proficiency in
Arcana and Intimidation.
A cleric of the Void domain also gains proficiency with
navigator’s tools.
CHANNEL DIVINITY: HIDDEN KNOWLEDGE
A cleric of the Void domain of 2nd level or higher can
use his or her Channel Divinity to gain advantage on
Intelligence checks. In addition, the cleric can choose to use
his or her Wisdom modifier instead of Intelligence modifier
when making these checks. Both effects last for 1 hour.
CHANNEL DIVINITY: DARK SECRETS
A cleric of the Void domain of 6th level or higher can use
Channel Divinity to inflict madness on nearby creatures.
When the cleric presents his or her holy symbol and speaks
of the Void, up to three creatures of the cleric’s choice that
can see and hear the cleric must make successful Wisdom
saving throws or be afflicted with a form of short-term
madness. An affected creature can repeat the saving throw
at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.
D10 FLAW (LASTS UNTIL CURED)
1 “I am obsessed with discovering the hidden meaning in seemingly random objects, such as shards of smashed glass.”
2 “Some event in my life never happened. I won’t acknowledge it or anything to do with it.”
3 “I hear them whispering, always whispering. They’re loudest near corners of rooms and other angles in structures.”
4 “I constantly scrawl a set of strange glyphs without realizing it, sometimes going so far as to cut them into my skin.”
5 “When I’m excited or upset, some of my words come out in a different language that I don’t even understand.”
6 “The trappings and symbol of a certain deity cause me great pain to look upon or touch.”
7 “Ordered collections of objects are fascinating, and I have to study and count them.”
8 “I collect strange or disgusting trinkets, such as teeth of creatures I kill or scrapings of dirt from everywhere I sleep.”
9 “The music is always with me, and I must let it out. It doesn’t matter that no one else finds the song beautiful .”
10 “I hear scratching just on the other side of interior walls.”
A cleric of the Void domain of 8th level or higher has the
ability to infuse their weapon strikes with divine energy.
Once on each of the cleric’s turns, they can cause a weapon
attack to deal an extra 1d8 cold damage to the target on
a hit. For a cleric of 14th level or higher, the extra cold
damage is 2d8.
A cleric of the Void domain of 17th level or higher can use
an action to create crushing gravity in a 60-foot-radius area
around the cleric. The crushing gravity lasts for 3 rounds.
All the effects cease immediately if the cleric moves.
The area becomes difficult terrain for the duration. A
creature that starts its turn in the area or that enters it
for the first time on a turn must make a Strength saving
throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 7d6 bludgeoning
damage and is affected as if by a slow spell until the start of
its next turn.
The cleric and up to three designated creatures are
immune to the effect. After using this ability, the cleric
must finish a long rest before using it again.
Given the nature of Void magic, it comes as no surprise that
a specialty of arcane spellcasting sprang up from the study
of Void Speech.
Void casters are a standoffish and secretive lot, prone to
delving into monster-prowled ruins and the dark corners of
moldering libraries with equal caution; carelessly reading
a text that might be sprinkled with Void glyphs can be just
as deadly as stumbling into a den of trolls. As Void casters
continue to study Void Speech, they learn to properly
invoke the words and glyphs to empower a special type of
magic that taps the vast potential of the Void.
Some Void casters risk the darkness for the sake of
gaining knowledge or strengthening one’s defenses against
that which lies beyond. Others succumb to the madness
and corruption that Void magic causes and become living
conduits for the horrors seeking entry into the world.
A Void caster can accumulate twice the normal amount of
Void taint before being affected by exposure to the Void—
and has advantage on saving throws made to resist gaining
Void taint.
Starting at 2nd level, as a bonus action immediately before
casting a spell of 1st level or higher, a Void caster can utter
a few words of Void Speech and weave its dark magic into
the spell. The tainted spell disorients one creature the
caster can see that the spell affects when it is cast. The
creature has disadvantage on the next attack roll or ability
check it makes before the start of the Void caster’s next
turn. The caster must be able to speak in order to use this
feature.
Beginning at 6th level, when damaged by a creature
within 60 feet, a Void caster can use a reaction to bark
a destructive word of Void Speech. If the creature can
hear the caster, it takes necrotic damage equal to half the
caster’s wizard level + his or her Intelligence modifier. A
caster can use this ability a number of times equal to his or
her Intelligence modifier (minimum of one), and regains
all expended uses after finishing a long rest. The caster
can’t use this feature if he or she is unable to speak.
Starting at 10th level, when casting a Void magic spell that
targets only one creature, a Void caster can also target a
second creature. Additionally, he or she has advantage
on Constitution saving throws made to maintain
concentration on Void spells.
At 14th level, a Void caster can choose a point he or she can
see within 60 feet and use an action to utter a complicated
phrase in Void Speech. The area within 20 feet of the
point is shrouded in dim light for 1 minute. Any creature
in the area that is hostile to the caster gains vulnerability
to necrotic damage and has disadvantage on Wisdom
checks. An affected creature that starts its turn in the area
or that enters the area for the first time on its turn takes
3d6 necrotic damage, or half that damage with a successful
Constitution saving throw (using the Void caster’s spell
save DC). Once a caster uses this ability, it can’t be used
again until after finishing a short or long rest. The caster
can’t use this feature if he or she is unable to speak.
Mythos MagicThe work of author H. P. Lovecraft—the so-called
“Cthulhu mythos”—has been a cornerstone of RPG
storytelling since E. Gary Gygax immortalized its
influence in his “Inspirational and Educational Reading”
list. Taking its name from Lovecraft’s famous story, “The
Call of Cthulhu,” the mythos has become the backdrop
for a subgenre of fiction sometimes called cosmic horror.
At the foundation of cosmic horror are two ideas: that the
human mind is too tiny and weak to comprehend more
than the barest glimmer of the vastness of the universe
and the alien mysteries it contains; and that among those
D10 EFFECT (LASTS UNTIL CURED)
1 Barbed Hide. Spiny barbs protrude from the creature’s skin. Any creature grappling the affected creature takes
2d4 piercing damage at the start of its turn. The affected creature experiences constant pain while wearing armor
or heavy clothing, giving it disadvantage on Dexterity checks made under those conditions. The creature has
disadvantage on Deception and Persuasion checks unless the barbs are hidden from sight (which might require
covering the creature’s face, at the GM’s discretion).
2 Eyeless. The creature’s eyes rot away, vanish (leaving behind smooth flesh), or otherwise become useless. The
creature permanently gains the blinded condition. This condition can’t be removed without curing this flesh warp.
The creature’s other senses are enhanced by the Void, granting it blindsight out to a range of 10 feet as long as the
creature can hear.
3 Gleaming Skin. The creature’s skin takes on a waxy, unnatural sheen. It might be pale, translucent, or even
crystalline in appearance. The gleam grants other creatures advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks made to
locate the creature by sight. If the creature is in bright light when it is the target of a melee attack, it can use its
reaction to add 1 to its Armor Class if the attacker can see its skin.
4 Pliant Bones. The creature’s skeleton becomes cartilaginous and pliable. The creature can move through a space
as narrow as 6 inches wide without squeezing (provided the creature isn’t wearing rigid armor), and the creature’s
Strength is reduced by 2.
5 Prehensile Tail. The creature grows a 3-foot-long prehensile tail. The creature can use the tail to make one
melee weapon attack with a simple weapon weighing 2 pounds or less, or to make one unarmed strike that deals
bludgeoning damage equal to 1d4 + the creature’s Strength modifier. The creature has disadvantage on Acrobatics
checks.
6 Proboscis. The creature’s mouth mutates into a long, tubular organ like the maw of a mosquito, moth, or worm. The
creature loses the ability to speak and has disadvantage on Deception and Persuasion checks unless the proboscis is
hidden from sight. The creature can use the proboscis to make a blood-draining melee weapon attack. The attack roll
can be made using Strength or Dexterity; a hit deals piercing damage equal to 1d4 + the creature’s Strength modifier,
and the creature becomes attached to the target. While attached, the creature can’t attack but deals the attack’s
damage automatically to the creature it is attached to. The creature can detach by spending 5 feet of movement. The
creature being attacked or one of its allies within 5 feet of it can free the creature from the proboscis automatically by
using an action to do so.
7 Sentient Tumors. Large cystic tumors sprout from the creature’s shoulder, arm, or back. These growths are sentient
and emit a weak psychic field. The character’s mind cannot be read telepathically or affected by divination spells. If
the character takes psychic damage, however, he or she must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or suffer the
effects of a confusion spell for 1 minute. The character also has disadvantage on Deception and Persuasion checks
unless the tumors are hidden from sight.
8 Stench. The creature exudes the stink of rotting flesh, acrid chemicals, sickly sweet perfume, or some other
odious aroma. Any other creature that starts its turn within 5 feet of the affected creature must succeed on a DC 12
Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the start of the creature’s next turn. This stink clings to any objects
that remain in the creature’s possession for at least 24 hours. Attempting to sell any such object might be impossible,
or yields only half the normal price at best. Food in the creature’s possession spoils after 24 hours.
9 Tentacles. One of the creature’s hands twists into a nest of writhing tentacles. Any check or saving throw the
creature makes to maintain a grip or a grapple is made with advantage. Any check or saving throw it makes involving
fine motor control or Dexterity is made with disadvantage.
10 Tusks. The creature’s incisors grow into enormous, curved and discolored tusks like those of a boar or a warthog.
The creature has difficulty speaking and must make a successful DC 12 Dexterity check to cast a spell that has a
verbal component.
mysteries are entities so ancient, powerful, and malevolent
that they could extinguish Earth’s insignificant civilization
without caring or even noticing.
With that in mind, this section explores those “hidden
and fathomless worlds of strange life which may pulsate
in the gulfs beyond the stars” that Lovecraft and his
contemporaries pioneered in their strange fiction. Herein
you will find a host of forbidden secrets and eldritch lore;
a clandestine sort of magic that is full of both cosmic
potential and horrific consequences, and knowledge of
which erodes the sanity of all who pursue it.
The spells in this category resemble Void magic in that they
harness the power of the Void, but they are not beholden
to it. Mythos magic uses the Great Old Ones as a conduit
for its power, while Void magic originates from the Void
itself (a place of negation and emptiness that devours the
cosmos, not an entity).
Mythos spells can be learned by anyone with magical
aptitude—any character who has the ability to cast
spells can add mythos spells to their spell list. All other
characters can acquire a mythos spell only if they learn
it from one of the forbidden and furtive tomes of the
Cthulhu mythos or see the spell being cast.
But this power comes at great risk. Casters of mythos
magic literally exchange their sanity for magical ability.
Unless a character is protected by great Wisdom or a
bulwark of arcane wards, using these spells will certainly
lead to madness.
Mythos magic is typically the province of wizards,
although any spellcaster can learn these spells under the
right circumstances.

Name: BLACK GOAT’S BLESSING
Level: cantrip
School: Enchantment
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 30 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 round
Description:
You raise your hand with fingers splayed and utter an
incantation of the Black Goat with a Thousand Young.
Your magic is blessed with the eldritch virility of the
All-Mother. The target has disadvantage on saving throws
against spells you cast until the end of your next turn.
5th-level transmutation (ritual) (mythos)
Casting Time: 1 minute
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S, M (a drop of snake venom)
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
This spell transforms a Small, Medium, or Large creature
that you can see within range into a servant of Yig (Creature
Codex, p. 325). An unwilling creature can attempt a Wisdom
saving throw, negating the effect with a success. A willing
creature is automatically affected and remains so for as
long as you maintain concentration on the spell.
The transformation lasts for the duration or until the
target drops to 0 hit points or dies. The target’s statistics,
including mental ability scores, are replaced by the
statistics of a servant of Yig. The transformed creature’s
alignment becomes neutral evil, and it is both friendly
to you and reverent toward the Father of Serpents. Its
equipment is unchanged. If the transformed creature was
unwilling, it makes a Wisdom saving throw at the end of
each of its turns. On a successful save, the spell ends, the
creature’s alignment and personality return to normal, and
it regains its former attitude toward you and toward Yig.
When it reverts to its normal form, the creature has the
number of hit points it had before it transformed. If it
reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess
damage carries over to its normal form.

Name: ECTOPLASM
Level: 2
School: Necromancy
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S, M (a pinch of bone dust)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Description:
You call forth an ectoplasmic manifestation of Medium
size that appears in an unoccupied space of your choice
within range that you can see. The manifestation lasts for
the spell’s duration. Any creature that ends its turn within
5 feet of the manifestation takes 2d6 psychic damage, or
half the damage with a successful Wisdom saving throw.
As a bonus action, you can move the manifestation up
to 30 feet. It can move through a creature’s space but can’t
remain in the same space as that creature. If it enters a
creature’s space, that creature takes 2d6 psychic damage,
or half the damage with a successful Wisdom saving throw.
On a failed save, the creature also has disadvantage on
Dexterity checks until the end of its next turn.
When you move the manifestation, it can flow through
a gap as small as 1 square inch, over barriers up to 5 feet
tall, and across pits up to 10 feet wide. The manifestation
sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius. It also leaves a thin film
of ectoplasmic residue on everything it touches or moves
through. This residue doesn’t illuminate the surroundings
but does glow dimly enough to show the manifestation’s
path. The residue dissipates 1 round after it is deposited.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by
1d6 for each slot level above 2nd.
5th-level divination (ritual) (mythos)
Casting Time: 1 minute
Range: Self
Components: V, S, M (corvid entrails, a dried opium
poppy, and a glass dagger)
Duration: 1 minute
You contact a Great Old One and ask one question that
can be answered with a one-sentence reply no more than
twenty words long. You must ask your question before the
spell ends. There is a 25 percent chance that the answer
contains a falsehood or is misleading in some way. (The
GM determines this secretly.)
Great Old Ones have vast knowledge, but they aren’t
omniscient, so if your question pertains to information
beyond the Old One’s knowledge, the answer might be
vacuous, gibberish, or an angry, “I don’t know.”
This also reveals the presence of all aberrations within 300
feet of you. There is a 1-in-6 chance that each aberration you
become aware of also becomes aware of you.
If you cast eldritch communion two or more times before
taking a long rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance
for each casting after the first that you receive no answer
and become afflicted with short-term madness.
4th-level necromancy (ritual) (mythos)
Casting Time: 1 minute
Range: 90 feet
Components: V, S, M (a fistful of grave earth and a vial of
child’s blood)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour
You call forth a ghost that takes the form of a spectral,
serpentlike assassin. It appears in an unoccupied space that
you can see within range. The ghost disappears when it’s
reduced to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.
The ghost is friendly to you and your companions for the
duration of the spell. Roll initiative for the ghost, which
takes its own turns. It obeys verbal commands that you
issue to it (no action required by you). If you don’t issue
a command to it, the ghost defends itself from hostile
creatures but doesn’t move or take other actions.
You are immune to the ghost’s Horrifying Visage
action but can willingly become the target of the ghost’s
Possession ability. You can end this effect on yourself as a
bonus action.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
spell slot of 6th or 7th level, you call forth two ghosts. If
you cast it using a spell slot of 8th or 9th level, you call forth
three ghosts.
4th-level necromancy (ritual) (mythos)
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour
Your touch inflicts a nauseating, alien rot. Make a melee
spell attack against a creature within your reach. On a hit,
you afflict the creature with the supernatural disease green
decay (see below), and creatures within 15 feet of the target
who can see it must make a successful Constitution saving
throw or become poisoned until the end of their next turn.
You lose concentration on this spell if you can’t see the
target at the end of your turn.
Green Decay. The flesh of a creature that has this disease
is slowly consumed by a virulent extraterrestrial fungus.
While the disease persists, the creature has disadvantage
on Charisma and Wisdom checks and on Wisdom saving
throws, and it has vulnerability to acid, fire, and necrotic
damage. An affected creature must make a Constitution
saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a failed
save, the creature takes 1d6 necrotic damage, and its hit
point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the
necrotic damage taken. If the creature gets three successes
on these saving throws before it gets three failures,
the disease ends immediately (but the damage and the
hit point maximum reduction remain in effect). If the
creature gets three failures on these saving throws before
it gets three successes, the disease lasts for the duration of
the spell, and no further saving throws are allowed.

You curse a creature that you can see in range with an
insatiable, ghoulish appetite. If it has a digestive system,
the creature must make a successful Wisdom saving throw
or be compelled to consume the flesh of living creatures
for the duration.
The target gains a bite attack and moves to and attacks
the closest creature that isn’t an undead or a construct. The
target is proficient with the bite, and it adds its Strength
modifier to the attack and damage rolls. The damage is
piercing and the damage die is a d4. If the target is larger
than Medium, its damage die increases by 1d4 for each
size category it is above Medium. In addition, the target
has advantage on melee attack rolls against any creature
that doesn’t have all of its hit points.
If there isn’t a viable creature within range for the target
to attack, it deals piercing damage to itself equal to 2d4 + its
Strength modifier. The target can repeat the saving throw at
the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. If
the target has two consecutive failures, hunger of Leng lasts
its full duration with no further saving throws allowed.
3rd-level transmutation (ritual) (mythos)
Casting Time: 1 minute
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S, M (a prism and silver coin)
Duration: Concentration, up to 8 hours
One humanoid of your choice that you can see within
range must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed
save, you project your mind into the body of the target.
You use the target’s statistics but don’t gain access to its
knowledge, class features, or proficiencies, retaining your
own instead. Meanwhile, the target’s mind is shunted into
your body, where it uses your statistics but likewise retains
its own knowledge, class features, and proficiencies.
The exchange lasts until either of the the two bodies
drops to 0 hit points, until you end it as a bonus action,
or until you are forced out of the target body by an effect
such as a dispel magic or dispel evil and good spell (the latter
spell defeats mind exchange even though possession by a
humanoid isn’t usually affected by that spell). When the
effect of this spell ends, both switched minds return to
their original bodies. The target of the spell is immune to
mind exchange for 24 hours after succeeding on the saving
throw or after the exchange ends.
The effects of the exchange can be made permanent with
a wish spell or comparable magic.
8th-level enchantment (ritual) (mythos)
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S, M (five teeth from a still-living
humanoid and a vial of the caster’s blood)
Duration: 1 hour
This spell impregnates a living creature with a rapidly
gestating hydra that consumes the target from within
before emerging to wreak havoc on the world. Make a
ranged spell attack against a living creature within range
that you can see. On a hit, you implant a five-headed
embryonic growth into the creature. Roll 1d3 + 1 to
determine how many rounds it takes the embryo to mature.
During the rounds when the embryo is gestating, the
affected creature takes 5d4 slashing damage at the start of
its turn, or half the damage with a successful Constitution
saving throw.
When the gestation period has elapsed, a tiny hydra
erupts from the target’s abdomen at the start of your turn.
The hydra appears in an unoccupied space adjacent to
the target and immediately grows into a full-size Huge
aberration. Nearby creatures are pushed away to clear
a sufficient space as the hydra grows. This creature is a
standard hydra, but with the ability to cast bane as an action
(spell save DC 11) requiring no spell components. Roll
initiative for the hydra, which takes its own turns. It obeys
verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required by
you). If you don’t give it a command or it can’t follow your
command, the hydra attacks the nearest living creature.
At the end of each of the hydra’s turns, you must make
a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. On a successful save, the
hydra remains under your control and friendly to you and
your companions. On a failed save, your control ends, the
hydra becomes hostile to all creatures, and it attacks the
nearest creature to the best of its ability.
The hydra disappears at the end of the spell’s duration,
or its existence can be cut short with a wish spell or
comparable magic, but nothing less. The embryo can be
destroyed before it reaches maturity by using a dispel magic
spell under the normal rules for dispelling high-level magic.

You invoke the twilight citadels of Koth to create a field
of magical energy in the shape of a 60-foot-radius,
60-foot-tall cylinder centered on you. The only visible
evidence of this field is a black rune that appears on every
doorway, window, or other portal inside the area.
Choose one of the following creature types: aberration,
beast, celestial, dragon, elemental, fey, fiend, giant,
humanoid, monstrosity, ooze, plant, or undead. The sign
affects creatures of the chosen type (including you, if
applicable) in the following ways:
• The creatures can’t willingly enter the cylinder’s area
by nonmagical means; the cylinder acts as an invisible,
impenetrable wall of force. If an affected creature tries
to enter the cylinder’s area by using teleportation,
a dimensional shortcut, or other magical means, it
must make a successful Charisma saving throw or the
attempt fails.
• They cannot hear any sounds that originate inside the
cylinder.
• They have disadvantage on attack rolls against targets
inside the cylinder.
• They can’t charm, frighten, or possess creatures inside
the cylinder.
“When the stars were right, they could plunge from world to
world through the sky . . .”
(From “The Call of Cthulhu” by H.P. Lovecraft)
Mythos magic seethes with the unnameable secrets of the
Great Old Ones—alien beings from beyond space and time
whose warped, eldritch minds are immeasurably superior
to our own and whose sinister, loathsome agendas
challenge not only our sanity but our very existence.
Many of the spells in this section refer to and take
inspiration from specific Great Old Ones and Elder Gods of
the Cthulhu mythos. These names can serve as narrative
waypoints as you chart the cosmic apocalypse of a
mythos‑laden campaign. In the same spirit of collaboration
that fueled Lovecraft’s circle of writers, you should feel free
to develop your own Mythic entities.
Some of the Great Old Ones and Elder Gods central
to mythos magic include: Cthulhu, Yog‑Sothoth (the
Beyond‑One), Shub‑Niggurath (the Black Goat of
the Woods), Bokrug, Tsathoggua, Koth, Bran Mak
Morn, Nodens, Nyarlathotep (the Crawling Chaos),
Hastur, Hriggala (the Jaws of Vardesain), the Magnum
Innominandum (the Not‑to‑Be‑Named One), Yig (the
Father of Serpents), and the White Goddess.
Creatures that aren’t affected by the field and that take a
short rest inside it regain twice the usual number of hit
points for each Hit Die spent at the end of the rest.
When you cast this spell, you can choose to reverse its
magic; doing this will prevent affected creatures from
leaving the area instead of from entering it, make them
unable to hear sounds that originate outside the cylinder,
and so forth. In this case, the field provides no benefit for
taking a short rest.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell
slot of 8th level or higher, the radius increases by 30 feet for
each slot level above 7th.
3rd-level illusion (ritual) (mythos)
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60-foot radius
Components: V, S, M (a pinch of black sand, a tallow
candle, and a drop of cephalopod ink)
Duration: 8 hours
Your magic haunts the dreams of others. Choose a
sleeping creature that you are aware of within range.
Creatures that don’t sleep, such as elves, can’t be targeted.
The creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or
it garners no benefit from the rest, and when it awakens,
it gains one level of exhaustion and is afflicted with
short-term madness.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell
slot of 4th level or higher, you can affect one additional
creature for each slot level above 3rd.
5th-level conjuration (ritual) (mythos)
Casting Time: 1 minute
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S, M (a vial of the caster’s blood and a
silver dagger)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour
You summon eldritch aberrations that appear in
unoccupied spaces you can see within range. Choose one
of the following options for what appears:
• Two ghasts of Leng (Creature Codex, p. 168)
• One shantak (Creature Codex, p. 328)
When the summoned creatures appear, you must make
a Charisma saving throw. On a success, the creatures are
friendly to you and your allies. On a failure, the creatures
are friendly to no one and attack the nearest creatures,
pursuing and fighting for as long as possible.
Roll initiative for the summoned creatures, which take
their own turns as a group. If friendly to you, they obey
your verbal commands (no action required by you to issue
a command), or they attack the nearest living creature if
they are not commanded otherwise.
Each round when you maintain concentration on the
spell, you must make a successful DC 15 Wisdom saving
throw at the end of your turn or take 1d4 psychic damage.
If the total of this damage exceeds your Wisdom score,
you gain 1 point of Void taint and you are afflicted with a
form of short-term madness. The same penalty applies
when the damage exceeds twice your Wisdom score, three
times your Wisdom score, and so forth, if you maintain
concentration for that long.
A summoned creature disappears when it drops to 0 hit
points or when the spell ends. If you stop concentrating on
the spell before 1 hour has elapsed, the creatures become
uncontrolled and hostile until they disappear 1d6 rounds
later or until they are killed.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
7th- or 8th-level spell slot, you can summon four ghasts of
Leng or a hound of Tindalos (Creature Codex, p. 221). When
you cast it with a 9th-level spell slot, you can summon five
ghasts of Leng or a nightgaunt (Creature Codex, p. 277).
9th-level conjuration (ritual) (mythos)
Casting Time: 1 minute
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S, M (a vial of the caster’s blood, a dried
opium poppy, and a silver dagger)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour
You summon a worldly incarnation of a Great Old One,
which appears in an unoccupied space you can see within
range. This avatar manifests as an emanation of elder
darkness, augmented by boons from the Void. Choose one
of the following options for the type of avatar that appears.
(Other options might be available if the GM allows.) An
asterisk indicates a spell described in this section.
• Avatar of Cthulhu. The incarnation is a deep one (Tome of
Beasts, p. 73) that can innately cast command and sleep of
the deep* at will.
• Avatar of Nyarlathotep. The incarnation is a dark voice
(Creature Codex, p. 73) that can innately cast bane and
semblance of dread* at will.
• Avatar of Shub-Niggurath. The incarnation is a goat-man
(Tome of Beasts, p. 231) that can innately cast Black Goat’s
blessing* and unseen strangler* at will.
• Avatar of Yog-Sothoth. The incarnation is a human with
1d4 + 1 flesh warps that can innately cast gift of resilience*
(see ) and thunderwave at will.
When the avatar appears, you must make a Charisma
saving throw. On a success, the avatar is friendly to you
and your allies. On a failed save, the avatar is friendly to no
one and attacks the nearest creature, pursuing and fighting
for as long as possible.
Roll initiative for the avatar, which takes its own turns.
If it is friendly to you, it obeys verbal commands you
issue to it (no action required by you). If the avatar has no
command, it attacks the nearest creature.
Each round when you maintain concentration on the
spell, you must make a successful DC 15 Wisdom saving
throw at the end of your turn or take 1d6 psychic damage.
If the total of this damage exceeds your Wisdom score, you
gain 1 point of Void taint and you are afflicted with a form
of short-term madness. The same penalty recurs when the
damage exceeds twice your Wisdom score, three times your
Wisdom score, and so forth, if you maintain concentration
for that long.
The avatar disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or
when the spell ends. If you stop concentrating before 1 hour
has elapsed, the avatar becomes uncontrolled and hostile
until it disappears 1d6 rounds later or until it is killed.
3rd-level conjuration (ritual) (mythos)
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 30 feet
Components: V, S, M (a pinch of sulfur and a live rodent)
Duration: 8 hours
You conjure an immaterial, tentacled aberration in an
unoccupied space you can see within range, and you
specify a password that the phantom recognizes. The entity
remains where you conjured it until the spell ends, until
you dismiss it as an action, or until you move more than 80
feet from it.
The strangler is invisible to all creatures except you,
and it can’t be harmed. When a Small or larger creature
approaches within 30 feet of it without speaking the
password that you specified, the strangler starts whispering
your name. This whispering is always audible to you,
regardless of other sounds in the area, as long as you’re
conscious. The strangler sees invisible creatures and can
see into the Ethereal Plane. It ignores illusions.
If any creatures hostile to you are within 5 feet of the
strangler at the start of your turn, the strangler attacks one
of them with a tentacle. It makes a melee weapon attack
with a bonus equal to your spellcasting ability modifier +
your proficiency bonus. On a hit, it deals 3d6 bludgeoning
damage, and a Large or smaller creature is grappled
(escape DC = your spellcasting ability modifier + your
proficiency bonus). Until this grapple ends, the target is
restrained, and the strangler can’t attack another target.
If the strangler scores a critical hit, the target begins to
suffocate and can’t speak until the grapple ends.

Description:
You attempt to afflict a humanoid you can see within range
with memories of distant, alien realms and their peculiar
inhabitants. The target must make a successful Wisdom
saving throw or be afflicted with a form of long-term
madness and be charmed by you for the duration of the
spell or until you or one of your allies harms it in any way.
While charmed in this way, the creature regards you as a
sacred monarch. If you or an ally of yours is fighting the
creature, it has advantage on its saving throw.
A successful remove curse spell ends both effects.
If antiquity looks upon the stories of Tolkien and
dreams of fated rings, or reflects upon the multiverse of
Moorcock’s White Wolf and thinks of cursed swords,
then surely the Cthulhu mythos will be remembered for
its magical tomes. Described here are three of the most
infamous installments in the mythos atheneum: the
accursed Necronomicon, Robert E. Howard’s Nameless Cults,
and the ubiquitous Book of Eibon. Mythos spells can be
learned only from a mythos grimoire like these or through
direct contact with a mythos spellcaster—and those
grimoires and casters take many abhorrent forms.
With a multiverse-wide perspective in mind, these
books are considered to be translations of the “real world”
originals—which is to say, they come from the alternate-
history Earth of Lovecraft’s Cthulhu mythos setting,
including elements of Howard’s Hyborian Age. How they
made their way through time and space to wind up on
alien worlds or your own setting is the stuff of splendidly
macabre speculation (and ultimately is up to you, the GM).
One thing’s for sure: these tomes are beyond precious to
all who hunger for the eldritch knowledge of the Great
Old Ones, and such longings aren’t restricted to humanity
and near-humanity. There also exist multitudes of odious
aberrations, monstrosities, fiends, and worse entities who
will stop at nothing to possess these tomes.
Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)
This fragmentary black book is reputed to descend from
the forgotten realms of Hyperborea. It contains puzzling
guidelines for frightful necromantic rituals and maddening
interdimensional travel.
The book holds the following spells (an asterisk indicates
a spell found in this book): semblance of dread*, ectoplasm*,
animate dead, speak with dead, emanation of Yoth*, green
decay*, yellow sign*, eldritch communion*, create undead, arcane
gate, harm, astral projection, Void rift*, and any additional
spells of the GM’s choosing.
If attuned to it, the book’s owner can use it as a spellbook
and as an arcane focus. In addition, while holding the
book, an attuned owner can use a bonus action to cast
a necromancy spell that is written in this tome without
expending a spell slot or using any verbal or somatic
components. Once used, this property of the book can’t be
used again until the next dawn.
Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)
This dubious old book, bound in heavy leather with
iron hasps, details the forbidden secrets and monstrous
blasphemy of a multitude of nightmare cults that worship
nameless and ghastly entities. It reads like the monologue
of a maniac, illustrated with unsettling glyphs and filled
with fluctuating moments of vagueness and clarity.
The tome contains all the mythos magic spells in this
section, plus any additional spells of the GM’s choosing.
The book’s bearer can reference Nameless Cults whenever
he or she makes an Intelligence check to recall information
about any aspect of evil or the occult, such as lore about
Great Old Ones, mythos creatures, or the cults that
worship them. When doing so, the proficiency bonus for
that check is doubled.
Wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement)
This monstrous-looking tome bound in humanoid skin
has an almost palpable aura of dread. A grotesque and
ghoulish face is stretched across its loathsome cover.
The Necronomicon is replete with fantastic legends of
elder magic and abhorrent secrets from beyond. Its
author, the mad poet-philosopher Alhazred, is said to
have been seized by an invisible monster in broad daylight
and devoured in front of a large number of horror-
stricken witnesses. Throughout unknown centuries, the
Necronomicon was rigidly suppressed by civil authorities
and by all branches of organised ecclesiasticism. Reading
this dreaded tome always leads to terrible consequences.
Among its hideous contents, the Necronomicon details
abstract formulae on the properties of space and the
linkage of dimensions both known and unknown. It
describes the presence of forbidden cults among human
beings who serve elder, primordial races and who worship
unseen entities with alien-tongued names such as
Yog-Sothoth and Cthulhu.
Despite centuries of repression, a handful of copies
of this horrible artifact still exist. Each one is a closely
guarded secret of its owner, and not all the owners are
human or even humanoid.
To reap the “benefits” of the Necronomicon, a creature
must become attuned to it and then spend another 19
hours reading and studying its blasphemous text. The
creature can then add to and copy the book’s contents,
provided any additions advance the cause of chaos or evil
and expand upon the lore already inside. (Because of this,
no two copies of the Necronomicon are identical, and no one
knows what has been added to or excised from Alhazred’s
original text.)
When a non-evil creature becomes attuned to the
Necronomicon, it must make a successful DC 18 Charisma
saving throw, or its alignment changes to neutral evil.
Unseen forces of evil will pursue any owner of the book,
hoping to steal it for themselves or for a more powerful
master. Once every three days while a creature is attuned
to the book, it has a 19 percent chance to encounter or be
attacked by a mythos entity or occult adversary of the GM’s
choosing. If a creature dies while attuned to the book, a
Great Old One claims its soul, and it can’t be restored to
life by any means.
Random Properties. The Necronomicon has the following
random properties:
• 2 minor beneficial properties
• 1 major beneficial property
• 1 minor detrimental property
• 2 major detrimental properties
Adjusted Ability Scores. After a creature spends the
requisite amount of time reading and studying the book,
its Intelligence score increases by 2, to a maximum of 24,
and its Wisdom score decreases by 2, to a minimum of 3.
The book can’t adjust the same creature’s ability scores
more than once.
Abstract Formulae. The Necronomicon contains a
multitude of mind-shattering evil magic, including all
mythos spells and Void spells in this section, all standard
necromancy spells, and any additional spells of the GM’s
design or choosing.
Eldritch Magic. Once a creature has read and studied
the book, any spell slot it expends to cast an arcane spell
counts as a spell slot one level higher when determining
the spell’s effect.
Eldritch Lore. The book’s bearer can reference the
Necronomicon whenever it makes an Intelligence check to
recall information about any aspect of evil or secrets of the
multidimensional universe, such as lore about Great Old
Ones or the properties of disquieting technology. When
doing so, the proficiency bonus for that check is doubled.
Eldritch Guise. While a creature carries the Necronomicon
and is attuned to it, the creature can speak, read, and write
Void Speech, and it can cast semblance of dread (described
above) as a bonus action.
Voidmarked. After a creature spends the requisite
amount of time reading and studying the book, it acquires
mental and physical disfigurements as hideous signs of
its devotion to the Great Old Ones. The creature gains
one flesh warp and one form of indefinite madness. The
voidmark grants you advantage on Persuasion checks
made to interact with aberrations and on Intimidation
checks made to interact with non-aberrations.
Thought Control. A creature that is attuned to the book
and holding it can use an action to cast dominate monster on
a creature within range (save DC 18). This property can’t be
used again for 19 hours.
Pages can be torn from the Necronomicon, but any eldritch
lore contained on those pages finds its way back into the
book eventually, usually when a new author or translator
adds pages to the tome. It is rumored that the Necronomicon
can’t be destroyed as long as a spawn of the Great Old One
Azathoth exists in the multiverse. A short-term solution
exists, however: casting the book into the fire of a dying
star scorches all the writing and imagery from its pages and
renders the book useless for 6d6 + 6 years.
Unsavory
CharactersEvery world has an abundance of villainous types that
stand in the way of what the heroes want to accomplish.
Two more examples of that sort are presented below: the
cleric who seduces followers instead of saving them, and
the grisly wizard known as the necrophage.
The Lust domain concerns itself with desire, sex, and
awakening passion in others. Clerics of lust often
seek to seduce others with their wiles, either for their
own pleasure, to lure them into a cult, or to otherwise
manipulate them into doing the cleric’s bidding.
1st charm person, command
3rd alter self, suggestion
5th hypnotic pattern, throes of ecstasy*
7th compulsion, lovesick*
9th dominate person, kiss of the succubus*
* Described in this book
A cleric who adopts the Lust domain learns the friends
cantrip. They also gain proficiency in one of the following
skills: Deception, Performance, or Persuasion.
CHANNEL DIVINITY: LUSTFUL DISTRACTION
A cleric of the Lust domain of 2nd level or higher can
use Channel Divinity to instill fascination and lust in
others. As an action, the cleric speaks seductively and
gazes lasciviously at creatures of his or her choice within
30 feet who can see and hear the cleric. Each target must
make a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a
target is compelled to devote its attention to the cleric for
1 minute. While the cleric commands their attention, the
targets have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks
to perceive any creature other than the cleric, and the cleric
has advantage on Charisma (Deception) or (Persuasion)
checks to further influence their behavior.
A cleric of the Lust domain of 6th level of higher can keep
the targets of a Lustful Distraction spellbound for up to 10
minutes as long as the cleric continues to speak to them.
A cleric of the Lust domain of 8th level or higher has the
ability to infuse his or her weapon strikes with divine
energy. Once on each of the cleric’s turns, when hitting
a creature with a weapon attack, the cleric can cause the
attack to deal an extra 1d8 psychic damage to the target.
For a cleric of 14th level or higher, the extra psychic
damage is 2d8.
A cleric of the Lust domain of 17th level or higher can
command creatures he or she has seduced. While creatures
are enraptured by Lustful Distraction, the cleric can take a
bonus action on his or her turn to verbally command what
each of those creatures will do on its next turn.
The practice of necrophagy is similar to that of necromancy,
but with a more horrific flavor. Necrophages, sometimes
called death eaters, consume the flesh of the recently
deceased to steal those creatures’ knowledge and power.
Adherents of this specialty claim that it is the origin of
all necromancy magic and necrotic energy. They view
the Negative Plane as a cosmic necrophage all its own,
devouring all matter, energy, and life and replacing it with
necrotic energy and undead.
Except as noted, necrophages function as necromancers
and use the wizard spell list. Instead of gaining the
corresponding features of the School of Necromancy, a
necrophage has the features described below.
When adopting this specialty at 2nd level, a necrophage
adds the find familiar spell to his or her spellbook if it’s not
already there. When a necrophage conjures a familiar, the
creature is undead instead of a celestial, fey, or fiend. The
familiar gains the following trait.
Undead Fortitude. If damage reduces the familiar to 0
hit points, it makes a Constitution saving throw with a DC
equal to 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage is radiant
or from a critical hit. On a success, the familiar drops to 1
hit point instead.
A necrophage of 6th level or higher can use an action to
consume a bit of flesh from an undead or a recently slain
(within 1 hour) creature with an Intelligence of 6 or higher.
An unwilling target is allowed a DC 14 Constitution saving
throw to resist the effect.
If the target is affected, the necrophage gains temporary
hit points equal to his or her wizard level, and if the target
was proficient in any Intelligence skills, the necrophage
can pick one of them. He or she gains proficiency in that
skill or, if already proficient, doubles his or her normal
proficiency bonus when using that skill. The temporary
hit points and absorbed skill proficiency last until the
necrophage finishes a long rest.
A necrophage can’t target the same creature with this
feature twice within 24 hours. If he or she uses the feature
on a different creature, the original effect ends.
A necrophage of 10th level or higher can use Memory
of Flesh to gain information from the creature as if the
necrophage had cast speak with dead instead of gaining
temporary hit points and a skill proficiency. An unwilling
target has disadvantage on its saving throw.
As with Memory of Flesh, a necrophage can’t target the
same creature with this feature twice within 24 hours. If he
or she uses the feature on a different creature, the original
effect ends.
A particular creature can be affected by Fruit of the Mind
a number of times equal to its Constitution modifier.
Beyond that maximum, fuerther attemts to target it yield
no results.
A necrophage of 14th level or higher gains several benefits
after using Memory of Flesh or Fruit of the Mind: he or
she no longer requires air, food, drink, or sleep; gains
immunity to disease, to being poisoned, and to poison
and necrotic damage; and can’t suffer a reduction in hit
point maximum. These benefits last until the necrophage
finishes a long rest.
ARCANE TRAPS(1d6) cold damage at the end of its turn, and can repeat the
saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.
Magic trap (enchantment)
This auditory trap uses otherworldly piping to transform
its listeners into addlepated imbeciles.
The trap’s insidious nature allows it to be hidden inside
a chest, behind a tapestry, or even within a bell or among
rafters. The only outward sign of the trap is a series of
skewed star-like symbols engraved into the trapped
room, chest, or object. The functional components (a
series of small silver pipes, like a pan pipe, and a small
set of magically animated bellows) can be found with a
successful DC 12 Intelligence (Investigation) check. Once
they are found, a successful DC 17 Intelligence (Arcana)
check identifies the trap and the correct method of
disarming it: a dispel magic spell (DC 17), which deactivates
it for 1 hour. Attempts to physically disarm the trap by
tampering with the pipes or bellows trigger its music and
effects immediately.
Touching a trapped chest or object, or the door of a
trapped room, triggers the trap. When this occurs, each
creature within 10 feet takes 7 (2d6) psychic damage
and must make a DC 12 Intelligence saving throw. On a
failed save, the creature’s Intelligence and Charisma are
decreased by 1d6 each. A creature takes the same psychic
damage each round it listens to the piping; plugging one’s
ears reduces the damage by half. The effect lasts until
the creature finishes a long rest or is targeted by greater
restoration or similar magic.
Magic trap (conjuration)
An infernal convocation is a way to use a conjuration in a
trap. A powerful caster binds a fiend, which is summoned
to a specific site when a trigger occurs. The fiend collects
a second sacrifice—whoever triggered the trap—and is
freed of its debt to the caster.
The trap is triggered as soon as a creature enters a magic
circle, which can be inscribed on the wall or ceiling, or even
woven into a carpet or limned on a cavern floor. There’s
no limit on the circle’s size; horrific tales of lairs being
encircled are told over campfires.
The purpose of the circle is deduced with a successful DC
18 Intelligence (Arcana) check. It can be disarmed with
a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check or a dispel
Wizards and other practitioners of magic create traps
that use spells as much as they use physical objects; some
of these hindrances have features in common with pits
and spear traps, while others rely on a series of finely
wrought glyphs or enchanted components that require
arcane knowledge to identify, much less disarm. A small
collection of these traps is provided here.
CTHUGHA’S CARESS
Magic trap (evocation)
The caress of Cthugha is patient, volatile, and the basis
of a trap that evokers find appealing. When this trap is
triggered by stepping on a pressure plate, opaque smoke
fills a 10-foot square for 2 rounds atop the plate, leaving a
thin film of soot on everything within the square when it
dissipates. On the following round, a flame fills the same
10-foot square and lasts for 2 rounds, dealing 14 (4d6) fire
damage, or half as much damage on a successful DC 14
Dexterity saving throw. Creatures covered in the soot have
disadvantage on the saving throw.
A successful DC 14 Intelligence (Arcana) check identifies
the soot as fire elemental residue. On a check that beats the
DC by 4 or more, the character recalls that the substance is
highly combustible. Removing the soot requires an action.
The pressure plate is detected with a successful DC 16
Wisdom (Perception) check, and it can be disarmed with
a successful DC 14 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools.
Failing this check by 4 or more activates the trap.
FURIES’ MOAT
Magic trap (enchantment)
Wizards of the Northern tribes fight alongside their
berserker brethren, intimately aware of the awful power,
and strategic limitations, of a warrior in the thrall of
mindless wrath. This trap is placed in a water-filled moat
or ditch that is laced with enchantments to drive enemies
into an incandescent, all-consuming rage.
The enchantment can be detected by a successful DC 14
Intelligence (Arcana) check. Swimming across the water
to the other side of the moat without incident requires a
successful DC 14 Strength (Athletics) check. On a failed
check, the creature is swept under, taking 3 (1d6) cold
damage, and it must make a successful DC 12 Wisdom
saving throw or be filled with murderous anger that can be
slaked only by attacking any creature within reach. While
affected, a creature must use its action to attack the nearest
other creature. An affected creature takes an additional 3
magic spell (which renders it briefly inactive). If a creature
that is not proficient in Arcana gets a failure on either
check, the trap is triggered and the fiend is summoned. An
uncommon variant of the trap exists in which a wall of force
spell traps both the prey and the summoned creature in
the same area.
SEVEN FLAVORS (OF DOOM)
Magic trap (evocation)
The number seven holds mystical importance in many
civilizations, but only kobolds apply that veneration to
their beloved art of trapmaking. The creation known as
seven flavors is a deceptively simple trap in which eldritch
needles spring from seven hidden tubes to strike a single
target and release their charge.
The trap is detected with a successful DC 15 Wisdom
(Perception) check. It can be disarmed only with dispel
magic, though it can be avoided or rendered ineffective
by blocking all seven holes. Each needle makes a ranged
attack with a +8 bonus. On a hit, a needle deals 7 (1d8+3)
damage of a different type from this list: lightning, fire,
cold, acid, psychic, thunder, or necrotic.
Magic trap (evocation/illusion)
The dwarven inventor of the trap known as step softly
believed that adventurers are their own worst enemy, and
couldn’t resist using their eagerness against them. A room
is built with a false floor too flimsy to support any weight
above a pit trap and temporarily braced with magic to give
it additional strength.
When everyone in the party has entered the room,
glyphs blaze into view, covering every inch of the
floor, appearing to trap the occupants in their spots. A
successful DC 10 Intelligence (Arcana) check reveals that
the glyphs are used with evocation magic. A dispel magic
spell dismisses the glyphs and the magic that supports the
floor, causing everything on the false floor to fall into the
pit beneath the room. A detect magic spell, coupled with
a successful DC 18 Wisdom (Perception) check, reveals
the glyphs glowing with illusion magic and a layer of
evocation magic under them.
Magic trap (enchantment)
Sometimes capturing thieves is more important than
permanently stopping them, and that was the impetus
for creating the dreamless slumber trap, which layers an
enchantment over a traditional needle trap on a chest or
door. The trap is triggered by touching the chest or door.
When that occurs, the creature takes 1 piercing damage
and must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or
fall into a dreamless, ageless, magical stasis. The stasis
remains until it is successfully removed by dispel magic (DC
17) or until three months have passed.
The trap can be detected with a successful DC 15
Intelligence (Investigation) check, and disarmed with a
successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools.
Spell Variations
This section contains riffs and twists for three classic
spells: charm person, fireball, and raise dead. These
experimental variations are meant to entertain players
and GMs who are more experienced with—or even jaded
by—the standard versions. Changes affect both flavor
and implementation, so the spells look different when
cast, have different power levels, and even have radically
different effects.
Each section covers one of the three standard spells, with
variations on its theme. Some are similar in effect to the
original but with altered story elements, and others have
more pronounced tweaks to their effects on the game.

Charm Person Variants
Charm person is the classic enchantment, dating to the
origins of the game in 1974. Its appeal is obvious: an
enemy grants a bit of friendly head start to retreating foes,
a recalcitrant informant suddenly becomes talkative, or a
town guard agrees to ignore a crime because that’s what
friends do for each other. The five variant spells presented
here all work on this theme but with differing levels of
power and specificity.

throw, with advantage if you or your companions are
fighting it or threatening it. If the saving throw fails, the
humanoid is charmed by you until the spell’s duration
expires, until you or any of your companions do anything
harmful to it, or until it performs a minor favor for you. The
charmed creature regards you as a friendly acquaintance or
distant kin. It is willing to reveal a secret, open a door, lift
an object, share food or water, or perform another favor on
a similar level. It won’t fight on your behalf, defend you in
combat, put its life or property at risk, or threaten or harm
someone else it considers a friend. When the spell ends, the
creature knows it was charmed by you.

if you or your companions are fighting it or threatening
it. If the saving throw fails, the humanoid is charmed by
a third humanoid you designate that both of you can see.
The spell ends after 1 minute, when you or any of your
companions do anything harmful to either of the spell’s
targets, or when the third humanoid disappears from the
charmed creature’s sight. The charmed creature regards
the third creature as a friendly acquaintance and will
follow it to keep it within sight. When the spell ends, the

Name: CHARM OF GREAT FONDNESS
Level: 2
School: Enchantment
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 30 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 hour
Description:
You attempt to charm a humanoid you can see within
range. It makes a Wisdom saving throw, with advantage
if you or your companions are fighting it or if you are not
the same species as the target. If the saving throw fails, the
targeted humanoid becomes quite fond of you until the
duration expires or until you or any of your companions
do anything harmful to it. The charmed creature regards
you as a potential romantic partner and seeks to attract
you in whatever manner is most appropriate to it. It might
tell you jokes or clown around, give you a (modest) gift,
flirt gently, flex its muscles and demonstrate its athletic
prowess, or compose a love poem to you. When the spell
ends, the creature knows it was charmed by you.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell
slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional
creature for each slot level above 2nd. The creatures must
be within 30 feet of each other when you target them. If
two or more creatures fail their saving throws, they fall to
bickering between themselves over who is more worthy of
your affection.

You attempt to charm a humanoid you can see within
range. It makes a Wisdom saving throw, with advantage if
you or your companions are fighting it or threatening it.
If the saving throw fails, the humanoid remains charmed
until the spell’s duration expires, until you or any of your
companions do anything harmful to it, or until a full moon
rises in the sky. The charmed creature regards you as a
friendly acquaintance. When the spell ends, the creature
knows it was charmed by you.
Raise Dead Variants
Raise dead is another spell with roots in the earliest days of
RPGs. The variants here are twisted, limited, or expanded
in several ways. They all return a creature to life but in
unexpected ways: as ghosts, for a short period, without
memories or skills, or under a particular compulsion.
Two aspects of raise dead are easy to change: the raised
creature’s appearance and the traumatic effect of returning
to life. The Raise Dead Random Effects table offers a
dozen options for reskinning raise dead in random ways.
When the spell is cast, roll a d12 or choose the option that
best suits the situation or the caster. This change need not
be a one-time thing; it can be emblematic of that caster, as
recognizably personal as a signature, a catchphrase, or a
coat of arms.

Name: RAISE GHOST
Level: 3
School: Necromancy
Casting Time: 1 hour
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M (a diamond worth at least 500 gp,
Duration: Instantaneous
Description:
which the spell consumes)
You return a dead creature you touch to a ghostly and
incorporeal form, provided it has been dead no longer
than 10 days. The creature can see and hear, and it can
speak in a hollow, sepulchral tone if it chooses to. Whether
it’s willing to speak to you depends on its whim and its
prior relationship with you, if any.
The affected creature is not undead; it is alive but
incorporeal, with 1 hit point. It can’t interact with the
physical world, attack or cause damage, or cast spells. It
is immune to nonmagical damage. It can move through
creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain, but it
takes 1d10 force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.
It regains hit points normally through resting or spending
hit dice but never recovers hit points via magic spells,
items, or potions.
This spell also neutralizes any poison and cures
nonmagical diseases that affected the creature at the time
it died. This spell doesn’t remove magical diseases, curses,
or similar effects; if these aren’t removed prior to casting
the spell, they take effect when the creature returns to life.
The spell also closes mortal wounds, but it doesn’t restore
missing body parts. If the creature is lacking body parts or
organs integral for its survival—its head, for instance—the
spell automatically fails.
Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The target has a
−4 penalty to saving throws and ability checks. Every time
the target finishes a long rest, the penalty is reduced by 1
until it disappears.
A creature affected by raise ghost is restored to normal,
physical life by raise dead or comparable magic. Raise ghost
has no effect if cast on an undead creature.

This spell is identical to raise dead in every way except
duration; the creature is restored to life for only 24 hours.
The spell can be recast on the same creature, but on the
second and subsequent castings, the caster must roll a
d20. If the roll equals or is less than the number of prior
castings on the same creature, the spell fails and cannot
affect that creature again. Each new casting resets the
clock to 24 hours; it doesn’t stack another 24 hours onto a
previous casting.

This spell is identical to raise ghost in every way, except
the ghostly figure can manipulate, hold, or carry objects
weighing up to 5 pounds. Note that while 5 pounds of
force is enough to pick up many melee weapons, it’s not
sufficient to wield one in combat, or to draw a bow.

Description:
which the spell consumes)
This spell is identical to raise dead, except it simultaneously
raises two creatures with opposite alignments. For
example, if you raise a Lawful Good paladin, then
somewhere nearby, a Chaotic Evil warrior of similar
power also returns to life. The second corpse must be
within 100 miles. The two raised creatures have a vague
sense of the direction and distance to their nemesis. They
aren’t compelled to battle one another or even to seek each
D
1 Nimbus. The target is surrounded by a glow or halo equivalent to faerie fire.
2 Thundercrack. When raise dead is cast, the target’s return to life is heralded by a crack of thunder and a stroke of
lightning. These can be heard and seen for at least a mile and may be accompanied by a sudden, brief storm.
3 Neophyte. The raised creature forgets one language, one spell or feat, one friend, and one class ability. These
memories return in a random sequence at a rate of one per week until all are recovered.
4 Exhaustion. Restoring a soul is as debilitating on the caster as on the dead. The caster suffers the same penalty on
attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks as the raised creature.
5 Voice of the Afterlife. The raised creature gained subconscious knowledge of a distant plane during its sojourn in the
realm of the dead. It now speaks either Abyssal, Celestial, Infernal, Satarre, or Umbral (player’s choice).
6 Breath of Life. The caster absorbs one magical disease, curse, or similar effect from the target creature into him- or
herself. The affliction ends on the newly-raised creature but takes full effect on the caster, who must get it cured or
removed by standard means.
7 Gravetouched. The raised creature has an uncanny voice or appearance that frightens nonhostile animals (including
mounts), children, and even adults unaccustomed to such things. Charisma (Intimidation) checks are made with
advantage.
8 Raging Spirit. The raised creature returns to life in the grip of intense and uncontrollable rage. It immediately
attacks the caster and anyone else nearby, including friends, acolytes, etc. This anger ends when the creature becomes
unconscious or when it’s affected by calm emotions or comparable magic.
9 Mild Spirit. The raised creature returns to life possessed of a gentle kindness. It refuses to fight, argue, or even
defend itself for a period of 1d6 + 1 days. This unnatural calm can be removed by a calm emotions spell. It also ends if the
creature is rendered unconscious by an attack.
10 Altered Spirit. The raised creature returns to life with a random alignment different from its previous one. This lasts
for 1d6 + 1 days. The creature’s alignment returns to normal if the creature is affected by a remove curse spell or if it’s
rendered unconscious by an attack.
11 Armor of the Planes. The raised creature gains resistance to necrotic, fire, cold, or lightning damage for seven days
(caster’s choice).
12 Servitor. The raised creature is charmed by the caster. While charmed in this way, the creature serves the caster loyally
as repayment for restoring him or her to life. The length of this service is determined by the caster’s spellcasting level:
up to level 11 = one week; level 12 to 14 = two weeks; level 15 or higher = one year. The effect is broken if the caster or
the caster’s companions cause direct harm to the charmed creature or its loved ones.
other out. Their lives are, however, inextricably bound
together in such a way that if either of them dies, the other
also drops dead instantly.
Evil NPCs brought back with raise nemesis typically see it
as an opportunity to create every sort of trouble imaginable.

only that creature is restored to life.

elder one additional year of life. The raised creature has
entirely white hair, its eyes are weak, and it loses 2 points
each from Strength and Constitution; no magic less
potent than a wish can restore these lost points. In all other

Description:
which the spell consumes)
This spell is identical to raise dead, except it empowers you
to impose a geas on the creature you raise. The targeted
soul can opt to decline the geas, in which case it isn’t
restored to life. If the creature accepts your geas, it must
complete the task within 30 days. If it accepts but fails to
meet the conditions of the geas, it dies on the dawn of the
31st day and its spirit again departs the mortal world. If it
accomplishes the task, it’s free to live out the remainder of
its restored life as it chooses.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell
slot of 7th or 8th level, the creature has a year to fulfill its
geas, allowing for much more complex demands. When
you cast this spell using a spell slot of 9th level, the geas
lasts until it’s fulfilled, no matter how long that takes, or
until it’s ended by remove curse, greater restoration, or wish.
Fireball Variants
Fireball is perhaps the most iconic damage-dealing spell
in fantasy RPGs, so why mess with it? Partly to add an
interesting twist to something familiar, partly to give it a
story or character spin, and partly just for fun. Here are
three options to consider for variant fireballs used by your
PC or NPC casters.
Fireball can be easily spiced up by changing its appearance
and damage type. The following table offers twenty
options for reskinning fireball; roll a d20 or choose the
options that best suit the character who’s casting the
spell. The new appearance can become emblematic of
that caster, as personal as a signature, a catchphrase, or a
distinctive facial feature.
All items created by a variant appearance vanish as soon
as their damage is done; no items or materials can be
recovered.

Fireball is an instantaneous spell, but it might just as easily
resemble heat metal, with a round of warning, a round of
damage, and a round of additional damage. Spreading
out the damage this way could be called a slow-burn fireball.
Though this is a bit more bookkeeping, such a spell
would be appropriate for limited use by a pyromaniacal
spellcasting NPC.
While fireball is an area of effect spell, a smaller version
could attack a single target. This might be called solitary
fireball, and could easily find a place in an elementalist’s
spellbook or in the hands of a fire imp or an efreet.
Finally, the third variant here is a bouncing fireball, which
(as the name implies) strikes one location, then bounces
according to the caster’s direction to a second location
and explodes again. This is similar to how chain lightning
works, but bouncing fireball attacks multiple targets in
both locations. The tradeoff is lower damage against each
creature when compared to chain lightning.

point, also within your line of sight and exactly 40 feet
from the second explosion, where it detonates for the final
time with identical results.
Note that for the second and third bursts, the flame
jumps exactly 40 feet—never more, never less—and if any
part of a burst area overlaps the area of a previous burst,
the burst fails to happen and the spell
ends immediately.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this
spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher,
the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot
level above 6th.

It is an age of war. Civilization slowly gives way to
encroaching wilderness, and once-mighty empires
now lie beneath the waves. Only magic and the warmth
of hope keeps lights aglow when dread things prowl,
and priestly wardings are bent by demonic rage.
The omens are dire. The roads to the shadow realm
are open again, and the fey have returned to claim their
ancient tribute. In the north the giants prepare for
Ragnarok, while the goblins in the west grow restless.
In the Crossroads, the shadow of the vampire princes falls
across the land. The World Serpent is stirring—and not
even all-knowing Baba Yaga can say what will happen next.
Now more than ever, Midgard needs heroes to stand against
the dark, driving it back with spell, steel, and cunning!

No matter how you slice it, magic is at the heart of fantasy—
and nothing says magic like a massive tome of spells.
This tome collects, updates, tweaks, and expands spells from
years of the Deep Magic for Fifth Edition series—more than
700 new and revised spells. And it adds a lot more:
• 19 divine domains from Beer to Mountain and Speed to Winter;
• 13 new wizard specialties, such as the elementalist and the timekeeper;
• 6 new sorcerous origins, including the Aristocrat and the Farseer;
• 3 otherworldly patrons for warlocks, including the Sibyl;
• expanded treatments of familiars and other wizardly servants;
• and much more!
This tome is not just for wizards, warlocks, and sorcerers. Deep Magic also
expands the horizons of what’s possible for bards, clerics, druids, and even
rangers and paladins. It offers something new for every spellcasting class!
With these new spells and options, your characters (or your
villains) can become masters of winter magic, chaos magic, or
shadow magic. Seek out hidden colleges and academies of lost
lore. Learn new runes, hieroglyphs, and cantrips to break down
the walls of reality, or just bend them a bit.
Deep Magic contains nothing but magic from start to finish!

School: Necromancy
Casting Time: 1 minute
Range: 1 mile
Components: V, S, M (a statuette carved in the likeness
Duration: Permanent; one generation
Description:
of the victim worth at least 1,250 gp)
You invoke the darkest curses upon your victim and its
descendants. This spell doesn’t require that you have a
clear path to your target, only that your target is within
range. The target must make a successful Wisdom saving
throw or be cursed until the magic is dispelled. While
cursed, the victim has disadvantage on ability checks and
saving throws made with the ability score that you used
when you cast the spell. In addition, the target’s firstborn
offspring is also targeted by the curse. That individual is
allowed a saving throw of its own if it is currently alive, or
it makes one upon its birth if it is not yet born when the
spell is cast. If the target’s firstborn has already died, the
curse passes to the target’s next eldest offspring.
Ritual Focus. If you expend your ritual focus, the curse
becomes hereditary, passing from firstborn to firstborn
for the entire length of the family’s lineage until one of
them successfully saves against the curse and throws off
your dark magic.

Description:
hit by a ranged attack from an attacker you can’t see
You release an arcane arrow that traces the path of the
triggering attack back to your unseen attacker, provided
the attacker is in range. That creature must succeed on
a Dexterity saving throw or be outlined in light until
the end of your next turn. While outlined in light, the
creature sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius, any attack
roll against it is made with advantage if the attacker can
see the creature, and the creature can’t benefit from
being invisible.

Name: AMPLIFY SOUND
Level: 1
School: Divination
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 120 feet
Components: S, M (a small cup and bit of string)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Description:
You turn your attention to a point you can see within
range, creating an invisible sensor in that location. For the
duration of the spell, you hear sounds from that point as if
you were in its space.
If the space where the point is located is subjected
to thunder damage, you take the thunder damage as if
you were in the space, but you don’t suffer other effects
associated with that thunder damage. For example, if a
creature casts the thunderwave spell, and the point you
chose is within the spell’s area, you take thunder damage
as if you failed the saving throw, but you aren’t pushed.
A creature that can see the sensor (such as a creature
benefiting from see invisibility or truesight) sees a thin,
luminous string winding from the sensor to you.

You touch a nonmagical melee weapon, temporarily
making it stronger, sharper, and more destructive. Until
the spell ends, the weapon deals an extra 1d6 damage of its
type on a hit. This spell doesn’t make the weapon magical.

3rd level or higher, you can target one additional weapon
within your reach for each slot level above 2nd.

You conjure an illusory apparition in an unoccupied
space within range. The shape of the apparition changes
in the minds of creatures who behold it, appearing as a
comforting something or someone that beckons to the
creature. When you cast this spell, choose up to three
creatures within range that can see the apparition. Each
target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be
charmed by the apparition until this spell ends. While
charmed, a target must take the Dash action and move
toward the apparition by the safest available route on

Name: AQUEOUS ARENA
Level: 2
School: Transmutation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 90 feet
Components: V, S, M (a drop of water)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Description:
You alter the air in a 15-foot-radius, 30-foot-high cylinder
centered on a point you can see within range. Within the
cylinder, air becomes viscous and takes on some of the
properties of water. Creatures inside the cylinder move
and fight as if underwater, and objects that aren’t being
worn or carried float or sink to the top or bottom of the
cylinder as if underwater. Creatures can move vertically
within the cylinder as if swimming in water.
Though the cylinder acts like water, it is still air.
Creatures and objects within the cylinder don’t have
resistance to fire damage from being fully immersed in
water, and creatures that breathe air can breathe normally
while inside the cylinder. This spell has no effect if cast on
a point underwater, and any part of the cylinder that is
underwater has no special effect.
When the spell ends, any creature above the ground that
doesn’t have a flying speed falls, taking falling damage as
normal.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell
slot of 4th level or higher, the cylinder’s radius increases
by 5 feet and its height increases by 10 feet for each slot
level above 3rd.

a creature you can see within range. Make a ranged spell
attack. On a hit, the target takes 1d6 thunder damage, and
the target is distracted by the lights and sounds until the
start of your next turn. While distracted, a creature must
make a Constitution saving throw whenever it casts a spell
that requires concentration. On a failed save, the creature
can’t concentrate on that spell, losing concentration on it
at the start of your next turn.
The spell’s damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th
level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).

arrow, bolt, or other projectile from a ranged weapon
When you cast this spell, two shimmering portals appear:
one green portal in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of
you and one purple portal in an unoccupied space within
5 feet of the arrow’s target. Any creature can step through
the green portal and appear in the purple portal’s space.
The portals are one-way. A creature that steps into the
purple portal’s space feels a tingling chill but is otherwise
unaffected by this spell. The portals last for the duration or
until a creature steps through the green portal.

Description:
You create and launch a missile of hardened ash which
travels toward one creature you can see within range.
Make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the target takes 3d6
force damage and 3d6 fire damage. When it reaches the
target, the ash arrow bursts into a 30-foot-radius sphere of
ash centered on the target, regardless if the attack hits the
target. The cloud of ash spreads around corners, its area is
heavily obscured, and it lasts for 1 minute.
When a creature enters the cloud for the first time on a
turn or starts its turn there, that creature must succeed on
a Constitution saving throw or become poisoned until the
start of its next turn. A moderate wind (at least 10 miles
per hour) disperses the cloud after 4 rounds. A strong
wind (at least 20 miles per hour) disperses it after 1 round.

subsequent turns, you can command one or more of the
tendrils to attack a creature within 10 feet of it. Make a
melee spell attack for each tendril using your spellcasting

Sickening energy radiates out from you in a

in the sphere has disadvantage on saving
throws against becoming frightened,
paralyzed, poisoned, or stunned.

Dozens of azaleas blossom on your skin. Until this spell
ends, if a creature hits you with an attack while within
5 feet of you, it takes 1d6 poison damage. If a creature
within 5 feet of you scores a critical hit against you, the

another surface within 5 feet of the target, such as a wall,
tree, or similar, for 1 minute.

DC. If it succeeds, it is no longer restrained.
While pinned to a surface that is lighter than it, such as
a chair or saddle, the target’s speed is halved, but it isn’t
restrained. The target can use an action to extricate itself

Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
Description:
A nonmagical wall of bark erupts from the ground to
protect you and your allies. Choose a space in front of
or behind you. The wall forms in that space, extending
15 feet out from that space along the ground in opposite
directions for a total length of 30 feet. The wall is 5 feet
high, 6 inches thick, opaque, and provides three-quarters
cover to creatures behind it.
If the wall cuts through a creature’s space when it
appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall
(your choice). The wall can’t otherwise occupy the same
space as a creature or object. The wall must be vertical and
must rest on a firm foundation, such as the ground, the
floor of a building, the deck of a ship, or similar.
The wall is an object made of bark that can be damaged
and thus breached. Each 10-foot section of the wall has
AC 15, 100 hit points, and vulnerability to fire damage.
Reducing a section to 0 hit points destroys it.
If you maintain your concentration on this spell for its
whole duration, the wall becomes permanent and can’t be
dispelled. Otherwise, the wall disappears when the spell
ends.

Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
Description:
A translucent but solid sphere of water encloses a Large
or smaller creature you can see within range. An unwilling
creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed
save, the creature is enclosed for the duration.
Creatures can’t pass through the bubble, but physical
objects, energy, or other spell effects can. The bubble has
an AC equal to your spell save DC and hit points equal to
twice your spell save DC. The spell ends for the enclosed
creature if the bubble is reduced to 0 hit points. A creature
inside the bubble has three-quarters cover from attacks
outside the bubble, and creatures outside the bubble have
half cover from attacks from the enclosed creature. When
the enclosed creature would take damage from an attacker
or effect outside the bubble, the creature can choose to
take only half the damage and reduce the bubble’s hit
points by an amount equal to the other half of the damage.
The bubble is weightless and just large enough to
contain the creature inside of it. When the enclosed
creature moves, the bubble moves with it. If the bubble
was created in an area with air, the bubble contains
enough air for a breathing creature contained within it
to breathe for the duration of the spell. If the bubble was
created in an area of water, the bubble contains enough
water for a water-breathing creature to breathe for the
duration of the spell.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell
slot of 3rd level or higher, the bubble’s hit points increase
by 10 for each slot level above 2nd.

the spirit is maintaining concentration on a spell, you
can’t cast a spell that requires concentration.
The spirit can’t be attacked or destroyed, and its
concentration can’t be interrupted. You can dismiss this
spell at any time (no action required), and a dispel magic
spell cast on the bee, if successful, ends this spell.

successful Charisma saving throw resists the effect and is
not picked out by the moon’s glow.
The glow does not make invisible creatures visible, but
it does indicate an invisible creature’s general location
(somewhere within the 5-foot beam). The light continues

You tap into the power of the Plane of Shadow and

mastiff disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when
the spell ends.
The mastiff is friendly to you and your companions.
Roll initiative for the mastiff, which has its own turns.
It obeys verbal commands that you issue to it (no action

it, the mastiff defends itself from hostile creatures, but
otherwise takes no actions.
The GM has the shadow mastiff’s statistics, using a dire
wolf, except it is a Monstrosity, it doubles its proficiency
bonus when making Dexterity (Stealth) checks, and it has
the Bay action and the Shadow Stealth bonus action, both
of which are described below:

Bay. The shadow mastiff uses an action to release a
terrifying howl. Each creature within a 30-foot cone of the
mastiff must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw
or become frightened for 1 minute. While frightened,
a creature must take the Dash action and move away
from the mastiff by the safest available route on each of
its turns, unless there is nowhere to move. A frightened
creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each
of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a
creature’s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for
it, the creature is immune to the Bay of shadow mastiffs

Description:
You create a 30-foot-radius area around a point that you
choose within range. An intelligent creature that enters
the area or starts its turn there must make a Wisdom
saving throw. On a failed save, the creature starts to
engage in celebratory revelry: drinking, singing, laughing,
and dancing. Affected creatures are reluctant to leave
the area until the spell ends, preferring to continue the
festivities. They forsake appointments, cease caring
about their woes, and generally behave in a cordial
(if not hedonistic) manner. This preoccupation with
merrymaking occurs regardless of an affected creature’s
agenda or alignment. Assassins procrastinate, servants
join in the celebration rather than working, and guards
abandon their posts.
The effect ends on a creature when it is attacked, takes
damage, or is forced to leave the area. A creature that
makes a successful saving throw can enter or leave the area
without danger of being enchanted. A creature that fails
the saving throw and is forcibly removed from the area
must repeat the saving throw if it returns to the area.
Ritual Focus. If you expend your ritual focus, an
unaffected intelligent creature must make a new saving
throw every time it starts its turn in the area, even if it has
previously succeeded on a save against the spell.

When a creature enters the spell’s area for the first
time on a turn or starts its turn there, that creature must

chains until the spell ends. A creature restrained by the
chains can use its action to make a Dexterity saving throw.
On a success, it wriggles free of the chains.
Until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action on each
of your subsequent turns to tighten the chains around one
creature restrained by the chains. The target must succeed
on a Strength saving throw or take 2d6 radiant damage

The amber can fit up to twelve Medium or smaller

A protective chrysalis surrounds a creature you can
see within range as it is reduced to 0 hit points. While
protected in this way, the target is still unconscious from
being reduced to 0 hit points, but unlike when a creature

protected. The target must make applicable death saving

The chrysalis has hit points equal to 5d8 + three times
your spellcasting ability modifier. When the protected
target would take damage, the chrysalis takes the damage

A body can be targeted by this spell only once. If the
target body was dead for more than one week, the body is
completely destroyed, and the creature can be restored to

This spell befuddles the minds of up to six creatures

see images of shifting terrain. Each target that fails an
Intelligence saving throw is reduced to half speed until the

it makes ranged attack rolls with disadvantage.
Affected creatures also find it impossible to keep

otherwise takes no actions.
If your concentration is broken, the ferry and its

The spellhound is friendly to you and your companions

has a range of Touch. You cast that spell—called the
contingent spell—as part of casting contingency boils,
expending spell slots for both, but the contingent spell

you create a new boil on your skin. Your skin can contain
a number of contingent spells within boils equal to your

your Charisma score is reduced by 2 until you no longer

When a creature within 5 feet of you deals

you issue no commands, the dragon only defends itself

The dragon is under your control for 8 hours, after
which it stops obeying any command you have given it.
To maintain control of the dragon for another 8 hours,
you must cast this spell on the dragon before the current
8-hour period ends, or you can use an action to make an
ability check using your spellcasting ability contested by
the dragon’s Charisma check, reasserting your control
over the dragon for another 8 hours on a success.  This use
of the spell reasserts your control over the dragon rather
than animating a new one. Once you have reasserted your
control over the dragon with two successful checks, you
can’t do so again until you reassert your control over the
dragon at least once with a casting of this spell.
The GM has the statistics for this creature, using a
graveyard dragon (see Tome of Beasts 2) or a young black
dragon with resistances and damage types appropriate to
the type of dragon you targeted with this spell and with
the following bonus action:
Reassemble Bones. As a bonus action, the dragon can
rearrange its bone structure to fit into a space as narrow as

The plague zombie uses the game statistics of a zombie,
except each time the plague zombie hits with a Slam

throw against your spell save DC or take poison damage
equal to your spellcasting ability modifier and contract the
cackle fever or sewer plague disease (your choice).
As a bonus action on each of your turns, you can

you control multiple plague zombies, you can command
any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same

zombie will take and where it will move during its next

commands, the creature only defends itself against hostile
creatures. Once given an order, the creature continues to
follow it until its task is complete.
The plague zombie is under your control for 24 hours,
after which it stops obeying any command you have given
it. To maintain control of the creature for another 24
hours, you must cast this spell on the creature before the

The mass has a speed of 20 feet, and it moves each round

shadows can also move vertically or across a ceiling, as

All light in this area is reduced to dim light. The surface
covered by the darkness is considered difficult terrain.
If the darkness moves into the space occupied by a
living creature, that creature takes 6d6 necrotic damage

Bright light can destroy portions of the spell. One

small bit of shadow essence behind, triggering a profound
fear of the dark. A creature you designate within range
must make a Charisma saving throw. If it fails, the target
becomes frightened of you for the duration. A frightened
creature can repeat the saving throw each time it takes
damage, ending the effect on a success. While frightened
in this way, the creature will not willingly enter or attack
into a space that isn’t brightly lit. If it’s in dim light or
darkness, the creature must either move toward bright
light or create its own (by lighting a lantern, casting a light
spell, or the like).

You return a dead creature you touch to life, provided it

All diseases or poisons that afflicted the creature at the

or penalties from them. The creature can’t be cured of
these diseases and poisons, and it is immune to any future
diseases or poisons that would afflict it. If the creature
is infected with a contagious or transmissible disease or

this spell, each creature within 30 feet of you that isn’t an
Undead or Construct must succeed on a Wisdom saving

While frightened by this spell, a creature views you
as a specter of death and impending pestilence, and it
must take the Dash action and move away from you by
the safest available route on each of its turns, unless
there is nowhere to move. If the creature ends its turn
in a location where it doesn’t have line of sight to you, it
can make a Wisdom saving throw, ending the frightened
condition on itself on a success.
Until this spell ends, each creature that starts its turn
within 30 feet of you has disadvantage on death saving
throws and on Constitution saving throws against disease
and necrotic damage.

You infuse yourself with devastating energy to be
unleashed upon your death. When you cast the spell,
choose one of the following damage types: acid, cold,
fire, lightning, necrotic, radiant, or thunder. When you
die, your body detonates, releasing an explosion of
energy in a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on your body.
Alternatively, you can use your reaction when you are
reduced to 0 hit points to trigger this spell, detonating
your body and dying immediately.
Each hostile creature within that explosion must make
a Dexterity saving throw, taking 10d6 damage of the
chosen type on a failed save, or half as much damage on a
successful one. The creature that inflicted the fatal damage
to you has disadvantage on the saving throw, and all 1s
on the damage dice are treated as 2s when determining
the amount of damage that creature takes. Your body and
all nonmagical objects you are wearing and carrying are
destroyed when you detonate. If this spell destroys your
body, you can be restored to life only by means of a true
resurrection or wish spell.
You can use only one death’s retribution spell at a time.
If you cast this spell again, the previous effect ends and is

You plant an obsidian acorn in solid ground and spend
an hour chanting a litany of curses to the natural world,
after which the land within 1 mile of the acorn becomes
infertile, regardless of its previous state. Nothing will grow
there, and all plant life in the area dies over the course of a
day. Plant creatures are not affected. Spells that summon
plants, such as entangle, require an ability check using the
caster’s spellcasting ability against your spell save DC.
On a successful check, the spell functions normally; if the
check fails, the spell is countered by desolation.
After one year, the land slowly reverts to its normal
fertility, rejoining the march of nature.
A living creature that finishes a short rest within the
area of a desolation spell halves the result of any Hit Dice it
expends. Desolation counters the effects of a bloom spell.

For the duration, you sense the presence of secret doors,
concealed traps, and areas hidden by magical or mundane
covers within 30 feet of you. If you sense a secret in this
way, you see a faint aura around the secret, such as an aura
outlining a secret door, a glow highlighting a trapped
flagstone, or a shimmering across the illusory wall that
hides a passage beyond it.
A secret door or hidden area, for the purpose of this
spell, includes anything purposefully hidden or concealed
in some way by its creator. A trap, for the purpose of this
spell, includes anything that would inflict a sudden or
unexpected effect you consider harmful or undesirable,
which was specifically intended as such by its creator. Thus,
the spell would sense an area affected by the alarm spell, a
glyph of warding, a mechanical pit trap, a leaf-covered pit,
a door behind a hanging tapestry, or a door flush with a
stone wall that is opened by a pressing a specific stone.
The spell would not reveal a natural weakness in the floor,
an unstable ceiling, an evil tome “hidden” in plain sight
alongside other books, or a crystalline phylactery “hidden”
in a display case with other crystals.
This spell merely reveals a secret’s presence and its
location. You don’t learn the methods of opening,
disarming, or otherwise bypassing or revealing the secret,
but you do learn the general nature of the secret and, if it is
a trap, the danger it poses.

you are hit by a melee attack but the attack roll exceeded
your Armor Class by 3 or less, one illusory weapon parries

Components: V, S, M (a small bell)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Description:
All creatures within 10 feet of you must make a Wisdom
saving throw. You must also make this save. On a failed
save, targets become bumbling and inept for the duration
of the spell. When you cast this spell, choose one from the
following options:
• Choose one ability score. While doomed, the target has
disadvantage on ability checks and saving throws made
with that ability score.
• While doomed, the target falls prone at the start of each
round, and its speed is halved.
• While doomed, the target must make a Wisdom saving
throw at the start of each of its turns. If it fails, it wastes
its action that turn, doing nothing.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell
slot of 2nd level or higher, the duration is up to 10 minutes.
If you use a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the duration
is up to 8 hours. Using a spell slot of 4th level or higher
grants a duration that doesn’t require concentration.

unable to stand up for the duration. Creatures with an
Intelligence score of 4 or less are not affected. At the end
of each of its turns, and each time it takes damage, a target

You create a 30-foot-radius sphere of pulsing, luminous
purple mist centered on a point you choose within range.
This area is heavily obscured. When a creature enters the
spell’s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn
there, that creature must make a Constitution saving
throw, taking 5d12 necrotic damage on a failed save or
half as much damage on a successful one. Creatures
are affected even if they hold their breath or don’t need
to breathe. After leaving the mist, the creature takes 5

Description:
You turn luck against a creature of your choice within
range. When the target makes an ability check, they must
first make a Charisma saving throw or the check fails.
This spell persists once cast, even if the target moves out
of range. If cast with a higher-level slot, each subsequent
effect is added to the effect noted above.
If the target ultimately succeeds on the check (or saving
throw or attack at higher levels), then you take 1 psychic
damage. If you ever unintentionally lose concentration on
the spell, you take 1d4 psychic damage.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell
slot of 2nd-level or higher, when the target is required
to make a saving throw, it must make a Charisma saving
throw in place of the required one, unless the required
one is more difficult to make. When you cast this spell
with a 4th-level slot, when the target makes an attack
roll, it must make a Charisma saving throw prior to
making the attack. On a failed save, the attack fails. If you
cast this spell with an 8th-level slot, this spell persists for

You drink a dose of venom or other poison and spread
the effect to other living things around you. If the poison
normally allows a saving throw, your save automatically
fails. You suffer the effect of the poison normally before
spreading the poison to all other living creatures within
10 feet of you. Instead of making the usual saving throw
169
CHAPTER 5 SPELL DESCRIPTIONS
against the poison, each creature around you makes
a Constitution saving throw against the spell. On a
successful save, a target suffers no damage or other effect
from the poison and is immune to further castings of
doom of serpent coils for 24 hours. On a failed save, a target
doesn’t suffer the poison’s usual effect; instead, it takes
4d6 poison damage and is poisoned. While poisoned in
this way, a creature repeats the saving throw at the end
of each of its turns. On a subsequent failed save, it takes
4d6 poison damage and is still poisoned. On a subsequent
successful save, it is no longer poisoned and is immune to
further castings of doom of serpent coils for 24 hours.
Multiple castings of this spell have no additional effect
on creatures that are already poisoned by it. The effect can
be ended by protection from poison or comparable magic.

Description:
You and three creatures of your choice within range must
succeed on a Constitution saving throw when the spell is
cast and again at the start of each of your turns while the
spell is in effect. A creature whose saving throw fails is
restrained. If one of the three targeted creatures fails this
saving throw, as many as two other creatures (per initial
target), each within 30 feet of the initial target, must
make the same save. A restrained creature must continue
to make saving throws each turn, and their condition
worsens on a failure, as follows:
Number of
Turns Affected
Condition
1 (spell is cast)
Restrained
2
Incapacitated
3
Stunned
4
Paralyzed
5
Petrified (turned to stone)
Each condition afflicted adds to the previous conditions.
New saving throws reduce the severity of the condition
affecting a target by one step on a success. If a target
other than you succeeds on the saving throw while it is
restrained, the spell ends for it. (You must make a saving
throw each round.)
As with all concentration spells, you can end the spell at
any time (no action required). If you are turned to stone,
the spell ends after all affected creatures make their saving
throws. Creatures recover immediately when the spell
ends, except for creatures turned to stone, which remain
that way until the effect is removed.
Creatures turned to stone can see, hear, and smell
normally, but they don’t need to eat or breathe. If shatter is
cast on a stone creature, it must succeed on a Constitution
saving throw against the caster’s spell save DC or be killed.
Creatures transformed into stone can be restored with
dispel magic, greater restoration, or comparable magic.

The ground within 30 feet of a point you designate within
range turns into filthy and slippery muck. This spell
affects sand, earth, mud, and ice, but not stone, wood,

affected area is difficult terrain. A creature in the area
when you cast the spell must succeed on a Strength saving

A restrained creature can free itself by using an action

that frees itself or that enters the area after the spell was
cast is affected by the difficult terrain but doesn’t become
restrained.
Each round, a restrained creature sinks deeper into the
muck. A Medium or smaller creature that is restrained for
3 rounds becomes submerged at the end of its third turn.
A Large creature becomes submerged after 4 rounds.
Submerged creatures begin suffocating if they aren’t

You create a ripple of dark energy that destroys everything
it touches. A 10-foot-radius, 10-foot-deep, cylindrical
extradimensional hole appears on a horizontal surface of
sufficient size. Since it extends into another dimension,
the pit has no weight and does not otherwise displace the
original underlying material. You can create the pit in the
deck of a ship as easily as in a dungeon floor or the ground
of a forest.
The pit’s radius expands by 10 feet at the start of your
turn each round for the duration. Any creature standing
in the original conjured space, or on a space taken up by
the pit as it grows, must succeed on a Dexterity saving
throw to avoid falling in. Any creature adjacent to the pit
when it expands must likewise succeed on a Dexterity
saving throw to avoid falling in. Creatures subjected to
a successful pushing effect (such as by a spell like gust of
wind) may not make this saving throw. Creatures that fall
into the pit take falling damage as normal.
The walls of the pit are slick and slimy, requiring a DC
15 Strength (Athletics) check to climb. Creatures and
objects that remain in the pit take 1d6 necrotic damage
at the start of each of their turns. If you fall into your own
pit, you take damage; then the spell ends and you are
incapacitated for 2 rounds. When the spell ends, the floor
of the pit rises, bringing creatures in the pit back up to the

around you to a distance of 10 feet for the duration. A
creature in the aura of shards has disadvantage on the
first attack roll it makes against you each turn, and when a
creature enters the spell’s area for the first time on a turn
or starts its turn there, it must make a Dexterity saving
throw, taking 3d6 slashing damage on a failed save, or half
as much damage on a successful one.

Name: EFFERVESCE SENSE
Level: cantrip
School: Transmutation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Description:
You transform one sensory organ of a willing creature
you touch. Choose one of the target’s sensory organs
(eyes, nose, mouth, ears, or skin). In a blur of magical
bubbles that inflate and pop around it, the chosen organ
transforms into the corresponding organ of an animal,
enhancing the associated sense (sight for eyes, smell for
nose, taste for mouth, hearing for ears, and touch for
skin). For example, a pair of transformed eyes might
become like a chameleon’s or owl’s, while transformed
skin might become covered in millions of tiny hairs like
those on a spider or the skin of the target’s hand might
become exceptionally fleshy like a star-nosed mole’s nose.
Once before the spell ends, the target can grant itself
advantage on one Wisdom (Perception) check of its
choice using that sense. The spell then ends. At the GM’s
discretion, this advantage can be applied to a different
ability check related to the chosen sensory organ, such as
a rogue gaining advantage on a thieves’ tools check while
listening to the tumblers within a lock the rogue is picking.
This spell has no effect on a creature with a naturally
strong sense, such as a badger’s already-enhanced smell
from its Keen Smell trait (though this spell can be used to
enhance the badger’s sight or hearing).

You and up to two other willing creatures you can see

prevents others from forming concrete memories of you.
Until the spell ends, a creature that interacts with a target
for less than 1 minute and in a way that isn’t impactful
remembers the target only passingly and with only
vague details. An impactful interaction includes combat,
being loud in a quiet crowd, or other interaction that
might be particularly memorable, such as being the only
person in drab, brown clothing at a noble’s extravagant,
colorful ball. At the GM’s discretion, other interactions
might be impactful to a creature based on that creature’s
personality, occupation, or other factors, such as a target
giving a gold coin to a beggar who hasn’t eaten in days.
The spell causes brief, non-impactful interactions with
the targets to be fleeting, vague memories. It doesn’t
change a target’s appearance or create any other form of

A weapon affected by this spell gains the Heavy
property and loses the Finesse property, if it has that
property. A creature wielding a weapon affected by this
spell has disadvantage on attack rolls with the weapon,
and the weapon deals an extra 1d6 force damage on a hit.
If an affected weapon is two-handed, a creature that starts
its turn holding that weapon must succeed on a Strength

While a creature wears armor that is affected by this
spell, the creature gains a +2 bonus to its AC, and its speed
is reduced depending on the type of armor: reduced by 5
feet if the armor is light, halved if the armor is medium,
and reduced to 5 feet if the armor is heavy.

Upon casting hellfire blitz, you assume a flaming spectral
form until the end of your turn. You immediately move up
to 40 feet in a straight line. You can move through spaces
occupied by other creatures, but you must end your turn

You leave a 5-foot-wide line of hellfire burning behind
you in your path. This hellfire continues burning for
a number of rounds equal to your spellcasting ability

You link your mind and consciousness with that of a
creature you can see within range. An unwilling creature
must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw to avoid the effect.
For the duration, you can use an action to see, hear,
smell, feel, and experience the world through the target’s
senses, gaining the benefits of any special senses the
target has, until you end the effect (no action required).
During this time, you are deaf and blind with regard to
your own senses. While sharing a target’s senses, it knows
the languages you know if you choose for it to know them,
and once each minute, you can influence one Intelligence,
Wisdom, or Charisma check it makes. If the target was a
willing creature, you can give it advantage on the check.
If the target was an unwilling creature, you can give it
disadvantage on the check.
Until the spell ends, you can communicate
telepathically with the target, and you know the direction
and approximate distance to the target, provided you
are both on the same plane of existence. If the target was
a willing creature, you can choose for the target to also
know the direction and approximate distance to you.
An unwilling target can make another Wisdom saving
throw at the end of each minute. It has disadvantage on
the saving throw if it doesn’t know you are connected
to it, such as if you haven’t spoken to the target
telepathically and haven’t influenced its ability checks. On
a success, the spell ends on the target. A willing target can
end the spell as a bonus action. The spell ends early if you
or the target are on a different plane of existence from
each other, if the target is reduced to 0 hit points, or if the
target is incapacitated.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
spell slot of 6th level or higher, the duration increases

is immune to all but psychic and radiant damage. The
target remains aware of its surroundings and can move,
but only as a shadow could move—flowing along surfaces
as if the creature were moving normally. The creature can
step out of the shadow at will, resuming its physical shape
in the shadow’s space and ending the spell.
This spell cannot be cast in an area devoid of light,
where a shadow would not normally appear. Even a faint

which the spell consumes)
This spell instantly summons a glittering moonbeam that
transports one sleeping creature or object of your choice
that you can see within range to a destination you select.
If you target an unwilling creature, it can make a Wisdom
saving throw. On a successful save, the spell fails, and
you appear in the target location instead. A transferred
creature wakes up as soon as it arrives at its destination. If
you target an object, it must be able to fit entirely inside a
10-foot cube, and it can’t be held or carried by an unwilling
creature. The destination you choose must be known to
you, and it must be on the same plane of existence as you.
Your familiarity with the destination determines whether
the creature or object arrives there successfully.
The GM rolls a d20 and consults the Lunar Transfer
table below.
• Grove or Magic Circle means a hallowed druid
grove or a permanent teleportation circle whose sigil
sequence you know.
• Memento means that you possess an object taken
from the desired destination within the last six
months, such as a book from a wizard’s library, bed
linen from a royal suite, or a chunk of marble from a
lich’s secret tomb.
• Very Familiar is a place you have been very often, a
place you have carefully studied, or a place you can see
when you cast the spell.
• Seen Casually is someplace you have seen more than
once but with which you aren’t very familiar.
• Viewed Once is a place you have seen once, possibly
using magic.
• Description is a place whose location and appearance
you know through someone else’s description, perhaps
from a map.
• False Destination is a place that doesn’t exist.
Perhaps you tried to scry an enemy’s sanctum but
instead viewed an illusion, or perhaps you are
attempting to teleport to a familiar location that no
longer exists.
On Target. The target creature or object appears where
you want it to.
Off Target. The target creature or object appears a
random distance away from the destination in a random
direction. Distance off target is 5 miles times a d20 roll,
though never more than half the distance traveled. For
example, if you sent someone 250 miles and they landed
197
CHAPTER 5 SPELL DESCRIPTIONS
off target, and you rolled an 8 on the d20, then they would
arrive off target by 40 miles. If you had sent them only
20 miles, they could not be more than 10 miles off target.
The GM determines the direction off target randomly by
rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as
east, and so on around the points of the compass. If you
were teleporting someone to a coastal city and they wound
up 20 miles out at sea, they could be in trouble.
Similar. Your target creature or object winds up in a
different area that’s visually or thematically similar to the
target area. If you are sending someone to your home
laboratory, for example, they might wind up in another
wizard’s laboratory or in an alchemical supply shop that
has many of the same tools and implements as your
laboratory. Generally, the creature or object appears in the
closest similar place, but since the spell has no range limit,
they could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane.
Mishap. The spell’s unpredictable magic results in a
difficult journey. The teleporting creature or object takes
2d12 force damage, and the GM rerolls on the table to
see where you (instead of the target) wind up. (Multiple
mishaps can occur, dealing damage each time.)

When you cast this spell, choose a school of magic. A

the spell fails to cast, expending the action and the spell’s
use or spell slot.
Active magical effects of the chosen school, such as the
spell false life when dampening necromancy or the spell
mage armor when dampening abjuration, are suppressed
while within this spell’s area. While an effect is suppressed,
it doesn’t function, but the time it spends suppressed

Description:
You make your flesh and blood poisonous, deterring
creatures that might want to devour you. For the
duration, any creature that hits you with a Bite attack
must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed
save, it takes 2d8 poison damage and is poisoned for 1
minute. On a successful save, the creature takes half as
much damage and is not poisoned. Creatures with an
Intelligence of 5 or lower will not willingly bite you again,
seeking other prey instead. If such a creature is unable to
disengage from combat with you, it will use other attack
actions to deal damage, if possible, but will continue to
use its Bite attack if it has no other option.
If you are swallowed by a creature, immediately after
you take whatever damage is dealt by the creature’s
digestion, the creature takes 4d8 poison damage and is
poisoned for 1 hour. A successful Constitution saving
throw negates the poisoned condition. On its next turn,
the creature uses an action to spit you out.

the target impacts a surface, such as a ceiling or wall, it
stops moving and takes 3d6 bludgeoning damage. If the
target was thrown vertically, it plummets to the ground,
taking falling damage as normal, unless it has a flying
speed or other method of preventing a fall. If the target
impacts a creature, the target stops moving and takes
3d6 bludgeoning damage, and the creature the target hits
must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be knocked
prone. After the target is thrown horizontally or it falls
from being thrown vertically, regardless of whether it
impacted a surface, it is knocked prone.

You return a dead creature you touch to a ghostly and
incorporeal form, provided it has been dead no longer
than 10 days. The creature can see and hear, and it can
speak in a hollow, sepulchral tone if it chooses to. Whether
it’s willing to speak to you depends on its whim and its
prior relationship with you, if any.
The affected creature is not undead; it is alive but
incorporeal, with 1 hit point. It can’t interact with the
physical world, attack or cause damage, or cast spells. It
is immune to nonmagical damage. It can move through
creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain, but
it takes 1d10 force damage if it ends its turn inside an
object. It regains hit points normally through resting or
spending Hit Dice but never recovers hit points via spells,
items, or potions.
This spell also neutralizes any poison and cures
nonmagical diseases that affected the creature at the time
it died. This spell doesn’t remove magical diseases, curses,
or similar effects; if these aren’t removed prior to casting
the spell, they take effect when the creature returns to life.
The spell also closes mortal wounds, but it doesn’t restore
missing body parts. If the creature is lacking body parts or
organs integral for its survival—its head, for instance—
the spell automatically fails.
Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The target has
a –4 penalty to saving throws and ability checks. Every
time the target finishes a long rest, the penalty is reduced
by 1 until it disappears.
A creature affected by raise ghost is restored to normal,
physical life by raise dead or comparable magic. Raise ghost
has no effect if cast on an Undead creature.

This spell is identical to raise dead, except it simultaneously
raises two creatures with opposite alignments. For

somewhere nearby, a Chaotic Evil warrior of similar
power also returns to life. The second corpse must be
within 100 miles. The two raised creatures have a vague
sense of the direction and distance to their nemesis.
They aren’t compelled to battle one another or even to
seek each other out. Their lives are, however, inextricably
bound together in such a way that if either of them dies,
the other also drops dead instantly.
Evil NPCs brought back with raise nemesis typically
see it as an opportunity to create every sort of trouble
imaginable.

Your magic summons an illusory recreation of an event,

When you cast this spell, choose a period of time you have
experienced within the last 7 days that is up to 1 minute
long. Illusory copies of the people, places, and events
that existed within 30 feet of you during that minute fill

that occurred within 30 feet of you at that time.
For the duration, you can command the illusion to

A creature that starts its turn within 20 feet of the
rift has disadvantage on the first attack roll it makes
before the start of its next turn, and when it moves on
its turn, it moves in a random direction.
Delights. Soothing lights and sounds float out from
the rift. Each creature that starts its turn within 5 feet
of the rift regains hit points equal to your spellcasting
ability modifier and can’t be frightened until the start
of its next turn.
Horrors. Tentacles erupt from the rift and fly toward
up to three creatures you can see within 20 feet of the rift.
Each creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw
or be restrained by the tentacles until the spell ends. A
creature restrained by the tentacles can use its action to
make a Strength check against your spell save DC. On
a success, it is no longer restrained. If no creatures are
restrained by the rift’s tentacles at the end of your turn,
the next creature, other than you, to move within 20 feet
of the rift must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be
restrained by the tentacles for the duration.

If a thrown creature strikes a solid surface, the creature

another tornado, it is then thrown up to 60 feet again in a
random direction from that tornado.
At the start of each of your turns, the tornados move up

A swirling vortex of hot steam in a 5-foot-radius,
