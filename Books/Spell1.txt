Name: Ability Rip
Level: 6
School: Necromancy
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 5 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Description:
You can rob a creature of one of its inherent
aptitudes and give that capability to an ally. Choose
one ability score. One creature of your choice
within range makes a saving throw with that ability
score. On a failure, the target has disadvantage on
checks and saving throws with the chosen ability
score. In addition, the target has disadvantage on
attack rolls using the chosen ability score, and deals
only half damage with such attacks if they are
weapon attacks.
When you cast this spell, choose another willing
creature within 30 feet. For the duration, that
creature gains advantage on all ability checks and
saving throws with the ability score you chose. In
addition, that creature gains 25 temporary hit
points.
At the end of each of the first target’s turns, it can
make a saving throw against the spell. It makes the
saving throw with the ability score you chose, but
the disadvantage inflicted by this spell does not
affect saving throws against it. On a successful save,
the spell ends.
“A poorly named spell. ‘Rip’ implies one
tears it away forever, but in truth, one
only borrows the ability for a brief
while. Pity.”

Description:
You touch one suit of armor, which hardens with an
extra layer of protection against attacks. The armor
gains temporary hit points equal to 1d4 + your
spellcasting ability modifier. While the armor still
has these temporary hit points, its wearer has
resistance to all damage except psychic damage.
Each time the wearer takes damage that is not
psychic damage, the same amount of damage is
dealt to the armor’s hit points.
The spell ends early if the temporary hit points
are depleted, if the armor is doffed, or if the spell is
cast again on the same suit of armor. You can also

A burst of energy radiates from you in a 30-foot
radius, dispelling shadowy foes and magical
darkness alike. Creatures of your choice within 30
feet of you must make a Constitution saving throw
or take 4d8 radiant damage. Creatures with
vulnerability to radiant damage have disadvantage
on this saving throw.
If the spell’s area overlaps with an area of
darkness created by another spell, make an ability
check using your spellcasting ability. The DC equals
10 + the other spell level. On a successful check, the
other spell ends. Multiple magical darkness spells
can be abolished in this way.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the radiant
damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above
3rd, and if the spell’s area overlaps with one or more
areas of darkness created by spells of 2nd level or

You touch a corpse that has been dead for less than

As a creature’s spirit exits its body, you reach out

Name: Absorption Ward
Level: 9
School: Abjuration
Casting Time: 10 minutes

Components: V, S, M (incense made from rare
Duration: 1 hour
Description:
This spell creates an arcane ward that surrounds
and protects you, harmlessly absorbing the energy
of spells that target you to fuel your own casting.
For the duration, you can use the ward as a reaction
to absorb a spell that is targeting only you and
which does not have an area of effect. The absorbed
spell's effect is canceled, and the spell's energy—not
the spell itself—is stored in the ward.
Once the ward absorbs a spell, you can use the
captured spell energy, which has the same level as
the spell when it was cast. The ward can absorb a
number of spell levels equal to half your level + your
spellcasting ability modifier. Once the ward absorbs
that number of levels of spell energy, it can't absorb
more. If you are targeted by a spell that the ward
can't store, the ward has no effect on that spell. You
always know how much spell energy your ward has
absorbed and how many spell levels are currently
stored within it.
You can convert levels of spell energy stored in
your ward to cast spells you have prepared or know,
creating new spell slots from the stored energy
rather than using slots of your own. You can create
spell slots only of a level equal to or lower than your
own highest-level spell slots, up to a maximum of
5th level. You use the stored levels of spell energy in
place of your own spell slots, but otherwise cast the
spell as normal. For example, you can use 3 levels of
spells stored in the ward as a 3rd-level spell slot.
Any spell levels remaining in the ward when the
spell ends are lost.
“I carried a
rod of absorption for many years, but lost it
recently during an ambush on Avernus. The ambushers paid
the price, but since that time I instead prepare this spell, which
grants what is essentially the same effect.”

accelerate the vital energies within it. The target
must begin a short rest within one minute,
otherwise the spell fails. At the end of the short rest,
the target regains the maximum number of hit
points for each Hit Die spent. In addition, the
recipient can make a saving throw for each poison
or disease affecting it. On a successful save, the
target recovers from that poison or disease.

of the following:

space is not farther away than you are now from
the creature that made the triggering attack.
 Make one melee weapon attack against the

the attack’s damage is resolved. On a failed save,

you instead, comparing the same attack roll to your
Armor Class to determine whether it hits or misses
you.

“The aegis spells were first researched and

Swordmages were never common, but their

the swordmage’s art there. However, since that
returned center of elvendom was again laid low
by the fall of the City of Shade, few new
swordmages have been trained. Of course,
eldritch knights and elven bladesingers aren’t

one of the Outer Planes, energies which correspond
strongly to certain ethical or moral alignments and
inflict extra damage against certain types of
creatures. When you cast this spell, choose one of
these four planes:
 Elysium (Good): Aberrations, chromatic
dragons, elementals, fiends, or undead.
 Hades (Evil): Beasts, celestials, metallic
dragons, humanoids, or plants.
 Limbo (Chaos): Constructs, angels, dragons,
devils, or giants.
 Mechanus (Law): Aberrations, demons, fey,
monstrosities, oozes, or undead.
Until the spell ends, the weapon inflicts an
additional 2d6 force damage against the types of
creatures listed for the chosen plane.
Your alignment may limit your choice of planar
energies when you cast this spell. If you are evil-
aligned, you cannot choose Elysium; if you are
good-aligned, you cannot choose Hades, if you are
lawful in alignment, you cannot choose Limbo; if
your alignment is chaotic, you cannot choose
Mechanus.

Description:
If you have at least 2 hit points when you cast this
spell, you can transfer any number of your own hit
points to a willing creature you touch. Each hit
point you transfer deals one damage to you and
heals your target for one hit point. You cannot give
the target more hit points than their normal
maximum, nor can you transfer any number of hit
points from yourself that would reduce you to less

Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
Description:
You choose any nonmagical writing you can see
within range and it is magically copied onto blank
paper you are holding. This spell copies 250 words
per minute and creates a perfect duplicate of the
original. It does not translate the text or make it
clearer.
Illustrations or magical writings (such as the text
of a spellbook, a spell scroll, or a glyph of warding)
are not copied at all by this spell. If the original text
contains both normal writing and magical writing
or illustrations (such as a letter with a glyph of
warding or a drawing in one corner), only the
normal text is copied.
You must provide blank paper in some form for
the spell to copy the text onto. If a blank sheet is
filled with copied text, you must cast the spell again
with a new blank sheet of paper to continue copying
more text.

Description:
blood of a black dragon and squid ink, which is
consumed by the spell)
You shake the glass orb as the noxious mixture
inside starts to bubble and smoke. You hurl the orb
at a point you can see within range. When the orb
reaches that point it shatters, releasing a sickening
form of ooze, a black pudding (your DM has
statistics for this creature). The black pudding turns
into a disgusting puddle of sticky tar when it’s
reduced to 0 hit points or the spell ends.
The ooze is friendly to you. Roll initiative for the
ooze, which has its own turns. The pudding follows
your verbal commands (this does not require an
action) to the best of its ability. If you don’t give the
pudding any commands it will move up to 20 feet
towards the nearest creature that isn’t you and
attack.
Amplify Sound

Name: Amplify Sound

Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
Description:
This spell greatly increases the volume of all sound
in a 15-foot radius sphere centered on a creature or
object of your choice within range. If an unwilling
creature is targeted by this spell, it must make a
Wisdom saving throw; on a failed save, the spell
successfully targets the creature. If the save is
successful, the spell fails.
Once the spell takes effect, a creature outside of
the spell’s area listening to sounds coming from
within the area has advantage on Wisdom
(Perception) checks to discern sounds within the
area. This amplifying effect isn’t noticeable by
creatures within the affected area. The spell has no
effect when targeting a creature or object in an area
affected by the silence spell or another effect that
quiets all sound.

Duration: Instantaneous
Description:
For the duration, you gain advantage on
Intelligence (Investigation) checks to figure out how
a device, trap, or mechanism works. If you are
successful on your Investigation check when
analyzing one of these devices, you gain advantage
on any ability checks used to disarm or operate the
object’s mechanisms for the duration.
Analyze Dweomer
8th-level divination (ritual)
sapphire set in a golden hoop worth at least 1000
gp)
Upon casting this spell, you can identify the magic
affecting all creatures and objects within range. For
magic items or other magic-imbued objects, you
learn their properties and how to use them, whether
they require attunement to use, and how many
charges they have (if any). You also learn whether
any spells are affecting the item and what they are.
If the item was created by a spell, you learn which
spell created it.
For creatures within range, you learn what spells,
if any, are currently affecting them.
Analyze Portal
2nd-level divination (ritual)
You can see the outline of any magic portal within
range. If you study a portal for 1 round, you can
learn one of the following things:
 Any special key or command word required to
activate the portal
 Any specific circumstance to activate the portal
(a time of day for instance)
 Whether the portal is one-way or two-way
 Whether the portal is functioning correctly or
not
 A glimpse of where the portal leads. The
glimpse lasts for 1 second, and you can see about
20 feet beyond the portal
For every round you focus on the portal, you
learn one more of the listed pieces of information.
Anathema
9th-lvel enchantment (ritual)
or scroll inscribed with the target’s name, detailing
the crimes for which the target is being condemned
and requiring 10,000 gp worth of special metallic
inks and rare mineral dusts to inscribe, which is
consumed in the casting of the spell)
You can permanently exclude a creature from the
benefits of your faith. The chosen creature suffers
the following effects:
 It can no longer cast any cleric, druid, paladin,
or ranger spells gained from the worship of your
deity.
 It can no longer use the Channel Divinity
feature if it is derived from the worship of your
deity.
 It cannot benefit from any of your faith’s
services, such as spellcasting provided by a
temple of your faith, or naming, marrying, or
burial services.
 If it dies, its soul is barred from entry into your
deity’s plane, just as if it had never declared
allegiance to your deity.
If you target a higher-level spellcaster than yourself
with this spell, the spell fails. A creature targeted
with this spell is instantly aware of all of its effects,
and that you are the caster. You can pronounce an
anathema effect upon any creature, even if it is on a
different plane. You cannot pronounce an anathema
against someone who is already dead. Some deities
do not allow an anathema to be pronounced against
the innocent or against their chosen, while others
grant their most powerful servants free use of this
most terrible of divine curses.
The anathema spell marks the subject as accursed
to others of your faith. If they are aware that a
creature is anathema, members of your faith feel
instinctively that they will displease their deity if
they speak to that creature, look at it, or even
acknowledge its existence. Clerics, paladins, druids,
and rangers of your faith automatically detect an
anathema effect simply by looking at the subject.
The effect is permanent until lifted, either by you
or another member of your faith of higher level who
can cast this spell. This spell is unaffected by dispel
magic or counterspell, and it can be neither copied
nor undone by a wish spell.
In campaigns featuring less traditional faiths
(such as worship of whole pantheons or sub-groups
of gods, gods with multiple aspects, a non-personal
sacred philosophy, etc.), the DM determines the
effects of this spell relative to such beliefs and
explains them when you acquire this spell.

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Description:
You fix your magically empowered gaze upon one
creature you can see within range, forcing it to
make a Wisdom saving throw. If it succeeds, the
spell has no effect. On a failure, it gains resistance
to all nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing and
slashing damage until the spell ends. However, for
the same duration, its movement rate is reduced by
half, it has disadvantage on all Dexterity saves for
the duration, and it can’t use reactions or bonus
actions until the spell ends. During the target’s turn
it can only take one action, and it cannot move
unless that action is one that includes movement
(such as the Dash action). Also, the target cannot
cast spells for the duration. A creature affected by
this spell can repeat the Wisdom saving throw at
the end of each of its turns, ending the spell on a
success.

often benefit from this spell if their
enemies are close at hand.”

Duration: Instantaneous.
Description:
A blast of brilliant energy bursts outward in a 20-
foot radius around you and each creature caught in
the blast must make a Constitution saving throw.
On a failed save, the creature takes 8d8 radiant
damage and is blinded for one minute. On a
successful save, the amount of damage is halved and
the creature is not blinded. Undead creatures have
disadvantage on this saving throw.
A creature blinded by this spell can try another
saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If the
save is successful, the blinded condition ends.
This spell cancels any magical darkness it touches
if the darkness was created by a spell of equal level
or lower.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using

School: Divination
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour
Description:
You can borrow some of the senses of a beast you
touch. During each of your turns you can use a
bonus action to see what the beast sees and hear
what it hears until the start of your next turn,
gaining the benefits of any special senses that beast
may possess. During this time, you are deaf and
blind with regard to your own senses. If the beast
moves more than 1 mile away from you, the spell
ends.
This spell only affects beasts with an Intelligence
score of 3 or less. It can also affect creatures that are
not beasts, but which are familiars (per the find
familiar spell), provided they have an Intelligence of
3 or less. You don’t gain any control over the beast
or any communication with it other than seeing and
hearing through its senses.
If you cast this spell on a creature that is tied to
another intelligent creature by a class feature or
spell (such as a wizard’s familiar or a ranger’s
animal companion), then the intelligent creature to
whom the target of this spell is tied can make a
Wisdom saving throw when you cast this spell. If
that save succeeds, the spell fails. Whether the roll
succeeds or fails, the intelligent creature tied to the
beast gains no special awareness of this spell or its
effects.
Animate Blood

Components: V, S, M (a drop of blood)
Duration: 1 hour
Description:
You deal yourself 1 slashing or piercing damage to
yourself to shed some blood, which you animate
into a tiny humanlike construct called a bloodling.
Bloodlings look like tiny humanoids made out of
dark red wax. Bloodlings are tiny, they have a speed
of 40 feet, an AC 18, 5 hp, and darkvision out to 60
feet. They are ineffective in combat but have +10 to
Dexterity (stealth) checks. They are too weak to
carry anything that weighs more than 5 pounds.
As long as the bloodling is within 120 feet you can
use an action to look through the bloodling’s eyes
and give it telepathic commands. You can specify a
general action such as “climb that” or “open that
book,” or you can take complete control of the
bloodling. The bloodling will take whatever actions
you command it to and nothing else.
When you cast a spell with a range of touch, the
bloodling can deliver the spell as if it had been the
caster. The bloodling must be within 120 feet of you,
and it must use its reaction to deliver the spell when
you cast it. If the spell requires an attack roll, you
use your attack modifier for the roll. Whether or
not the spell is successful, when you have a
bloodling deliver a spell in this way, your animate
blood spell ends and the bloodling is destroyed.

to their feet. You choose a number of corpses within
range equal to your spellcasting ability modifier and
animate them, as if with the animate dead spell.
Treat these animated corpses as zombies, with
the following exceptions. The zombies follow your
commands to the best of their ability but are not
intelligent and take things very literally. Each
zombie’s initiative is the same as yours, but its turn
does not take place until yours ends. If you do not
issue a new command to the zombie, it will
continue to follow any previous orders if possible,
otherwise it takes the dodge action. Undead
animated by this spell cannot be turned. When
reduced to 0 hit points or after the spell ends, each
zombie turns back into a lifeless corpse.

This spell grants you the ability to cast any one spell
of your choice from the wizard spell list, provided it
is a 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th level spell. As part of the
action used to cast this spell, you must read the
spell you intend to cast directly from a scroll or a
wizard’s spellbook, or the spell fails (reading from a
spell scroll in this way does not use the spell scroll).
Once you cast anyspell, the spell you chose and
read can be cast any time until the end of your next
turn, using the required casting time and
components. (Therefore, spells that take longer
than 1 round to cast are usually not suitable choices
this spell.) To cast the chosen spell, you must still
expend a spell slot of the appropriate level.

much on a successful one. This spell fouls rivers,
destroys forests and devastates towns and castles.
Thousands of innocent lives could be lost.
Casting this spell is an unquestionably evil act.
Other gods take notice, and often warn their
followers or send servants to deal with you directly.
Channeling the essence of entropy takes a direct toll
on the caster as well: when you cast this spell, you

You transform into a wolf.
The spell lasts for the
duration, or until you choose
to end it, or until your wolf
form drops to 0 hit points.
While you are transformed,
the following rules apply:
 Your game statistics are
replaced by the statistics of a
wolf, but you retain your
alignment, personality, and Intelligence,
Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain
all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies,
in addition to gaining those of a wolf.
 When you transform, you assume the wolf’s hit
points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your
normal form, you return to the number of hit
points you had before you transformed.
However, if you revert as a result of dropping to
0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to
your normal form.
 You can’t cast spells, and your ability to speak or
take any action that requires hands is limited to
the capabilities of a wolf. Transforming doesn’t
break your concentration on a spell you’ve
already cast, however, or prevent you from
taking actions that are part of a spell, such as
call lightning, that you’ve already cast.
 You retain the benefit of any features from your
class, race, or other source and can use them if
the wolf form is physically capable of doing so.
 You choose whether your equipment falls to the
ground in your space, merges into your wolf
form, or is worn by it. Your equipment doesn’t
change size or shape to match the wolf form,
and any equipment that the new form can’t
wear must either fall to the ground or merge
with it. You can’t activate, wield, or otherwise
benefit from any of your equipment that merges
with your wolf form until you leave wolf form.

friendly to you, based on how you treated it while it
was charmed.
“Few spells ever inspire anything in me that
would be akin to fear. Yet awaken construct is
one of these, for a simple reason: I cannot
determine the source of the intelligence that

7d8 and add the results together, then make a
Charisma (Deception) check and add your result to

creature to be affected. If you attack one or more
affected creatures, harm one or more of them with a

towards the nearest
creature, the target still has
no creatures within reach, it uses the Dash action to
move towards the nearest creature. If it cannot do
so, it attacks an object within range, which may be
the ground or a wall. Whenever there are multiple
creatures equally close to the target, the DM
randomly chooses which one it moves towards or
attacks.

“At first I wondered why Khelben included this
spell, as he had always strongly disliked its
creator—the same Oeridian wizard famous for
the many hand-themed spells he developed,
which were later consolidated into the single
spell Bigby’s hand. Khelben often said that
Bigby ‘comes up with one good gimmick, and
beats it to death with a rock.’
“I asked him why he copied this spell into so
many of his grimoires, given this acrimony.
Khelben said he enjoyed ‘the novelty of Bigby
finally having one spell he didn’t base on
appendages.’”

“My understanding was that Khelben’s true rivalry with my
former apprentice Bigby began when they both competed for the
love of the same woman.”

For the duration, you roll a d20 at the end of each

from your current plane of existence and appear in
a shadowy reflection of it, which lies somewhere on
the planar boundary between your current location
and the Shadowfell. (If you are already in the
Shadowfell when you cast this spell, the spell fails
and the casting is wasted.) At the start of you next
turn, and when the spell ends if you are in the
shadowy reflection, you return to an unoccupied
space of your choice that you can see within 10 feet
of the space you vanished from. If no unoccupied
space is available within that range, you appear in

more than one space is equally near). You can

“The creation of many cursing spells is

As part of the reaction used to cast this spell, you

unoccupied space adjacent to that creature. After
you make the choice of whether or not to use your
bonus action to teleport, the spell ends. After this
spell ends, until the end of your next turn, your
speed is halved and you cannot benefit from any
bonus to your speed.
“The
blurred step cantrip was developed in imitation of a
psionic power, taught in an intriguing tome known as the
Talaric Codex. This ancient document now exists only in
fragments, but it posits the theory that psionic powers become
more common on any world in direct proportion to how much of
a threat invading aberrations from the Far Realm pose to that
plane.
“Of course, that is a difficult theory to prove or disprove.
What few can deny is that the psychic warriors who mastered
the
blurred step, known as battleminds, were relentless in
hunting down descendants of the Far Realm such as illithids
and aboleths. This particular power made it very difficult for
their quarry to escape.”

“I suspect the body blades spell was inspired by
the bladelings, a race hailing from the plane of
Acheron. They have skin of a dull metallic hue,
sported with patches of keen metallic spines,
and eyes that gleam like shards of purple ice. It
is likely they are not truly native to Acheron,
but immigrated there, pershaps from the Hells,
Gehenna, or some unknown metal-based
plane.”

Description:
You give a high-pitched scream that erupts into a
thunderous 20-foot radius burst at a point you
choose within range. Each creature in the affected
area must make a Constitution saving throw or take
10d8 thunder damage on a failed save, or half as
much damage on a successful one. This spell fails if
cast into an area affected by silence.
A creature made of inorganic material such as
stone, crystal, or metal has disadvantage on this
saving throw. A nonmagical object that isn't being
worn or carried also takes the damage if it's in the
spell's area. The sound of this spell can be heard up
to 900 feet away (or farther with a successful
Wisdom (Perception) check as determined by your

Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self (10-foot radius)
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
Description:
You emit a rhythmic droning sound that creates a
10-foot radius sonic barrier around you, and which
moves with you. Creatures on either side of the
barrier perceive it as a harmless buzzing sound.
However, the barrier disrupts both magical and
nonmagical missiles fired into or out of it, causing
disadvantage on ranged attack rolls.
The barrier can also disrupt spells that deal
thunder damage. A spellcaster attempting to cast a
spell that deals thunder damage into the area must
make an ability check for their spellcasting ability,
against a DC equal to your spell save DC. On a
successful check, the spell works normally, but it is
dispelled on a failed check.
A creature that attempts to cross the barrier in
either direction must make a Constitution saving
throw. On a failed save, the creature is deafened for
1 minute and takes 4d6 thunder damage. The
creature can attempt a new saving throw at the end
of each of its turns, and on a success, it is no longer
deafened. If the creature succeeded on its saving
throw when it crossed the barrier, it takes half the
thunder damage and isn’t deafened. A creature
made of inorganic material such as stone, crystal, or
metal has disadvantage on this saving throw.
A creature that is forced to cross the barrier is not
affected by the cacophonic shield for that
movement.
A creature made of inorganic material such as
stone, crystal, or metal has disadvantage on this
saving throw.

School: Conjuration
Casting Time: 1 bonus action
Range: Self
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Description:
Both your hands must be empty when you cast this
spell, which causes an otherworldly polearm made
of smoldering green iron to appear in your two free
hands. This magic polearm lasts until the spell ends.
It counts as a martial melee weapon with which you
are proficient, and you can use your spellcasting
ability instead of Strength for the attack and
damage rolls of melee attacks using that weapon. It
deals 4d10 necrotic damage on hit and has the
heavy, reach, and two-handed properties.
In addition, when you hit a creature with the
polearm, the target’s speed is reduced by half, you
pull it 5 feet closer to you, and all melee attacks
against the target are made with advantage until it
starts its turn further than 5 feet away from you.
If you drop the weapon, it dissipates at the end of
the turn. Thereafter, while the spell persists, you
can use a bonus action to cause the polearm to
reappear in your hand.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage

Range: 30 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: 10 minutes
Description:
or an ally within range reduces a hostile creature to
0 hit points
When their comrade falls, you convince
beleaguered foes they would be wiser to surrender.
Roll 6d6 and add the results together, then make a
Charisma (Intimidation) check and add your result
to that total. The final total is how many hit points
of creatures this spell can affect. Creatures within
range of you that are hostile to you are affected in
ascending order of their current hit points (ignoring
unconscious creatures and creatures that cannot see
or hear you).
Starting with the creature that has the lowest
current hit points, each creature affected by this
spell drops any weapons it is holding, and for the
duration it can take no action except the Dodge,
Disengage, or Dash actions. You can make any
creature affected by this spell indifferent about
creatures of your choice that it is hostile toward.
Subtract each creature's hit points from the total
before moving on to the creature with the next
lowest hit points. A creature's hit points must
be equal to or less than the remaining
total for that creature to be
affected. This spell ends
early on any target that is
attacked or harmed by a
spell, or that witnesses
any of its friends being
harmed. When the spell
ends, a target remains
indifferent unless the DM rules that
it becomes hostile again. Undead,
constructs, and creatures immune to
being frightened aren't affected by
this spell.
At Higher Levels. When you
cast this spell using a spell
slot of 3rd level or
higher, roll an
additional 2d6 for
each slot
level above

Casting Time: 1 minute
Range: Self (30 feet)
Components: V, S, M (an offering, see spell)
Duration: 1 week
Description:
Choose a target within range, which must make a
Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the next time
the target falls asleep, it awakens 30 minutes later
mad with rage, immediately moving towards the
nearest creature that moves and making a melee
attack against it. While enraged by this spell, target
does not cast spells or make ranged
attacks, but is compelled to continue
making melee attacks against its target.
This mad rage continues for 1
minute, during which time it
continues to attack its target
relentlessly. It only willingly
stops if the target creature is
dead or somehow completely
removed from the situation,
in which case it chooses the
nearest creature that moves
as its new target and attacks
it in the same way.
The creature enraged by
this spell can repeat the
Wisdom saving throw at the
end of each of its turns, ending
the spell on a success. Otherwise,
the spell ends 1 minute after the
creature awoke in its rage.
When this spell ends, the target
falls unconscious and goes back to
sleep. Unless awakened, it sleeps for
whatever length of time it would
normally sleep. The target retains no
memory of what happened while it
was ensorcelled by this spell.
Call Nightmare
4th-level conjuration (ritual)
You summon a nightmare from the lower planes to
serve as mount. You must present an offering to the
nightmare to ensure its loyalty, but what the
nightmares want varies wildly from one to another.
A soul of a young child is the often a safe choice. If
the nightmare approves of the offering it will serve
the spellcaster for one week before returning to the
lower planes. Casting this spell again will summon a
new nightmare or the same one, depending on the
caster’s desire. If the nightmare disapproves of the
offering it disappears in a cloud of rancid smoke. If
the offering is particularly lacking, the nightmare
may return with allies.

creating an area of calm within a 20-foot radius
sphere centered on you. A creature inside the spell’s
area is immune to the effects of high winds from
either natural effects or spells. In addition, air-based
elemental creatures treat the area as difficult terrain

detectable by detect magic. If the box is placed on
the ground, opened, and the password said aloud,
the spell takes effect. For 10 minutes any creature

the password is hit by a bolt of lightning and must
make a Dexterity saving throw. They take 6d6

same madness as the original target. This madness
lasts 24 hours, even if the original target rolled the
same result twice.

while it is within 5 feet of you, it has disadvantage
on the attack.

“how this most secret of our spells came to be

“It is very interesting that a copy of this grimoire seems to have

the multiverse. Travel there requires a unique and specific
means of traversing the Deep Ethereal, one better not discussed

of its turns for the duration. The target takes 2d8
fire damage on a failed save, or half as much
damage on a successful one. All unattended objects
within 10 feet of the target catch on fire from the
intense heat.
In addition, if a creature ends its turn within 10
feet of the target, it must make a Dexterity saving
throw, taking 2d6 fire damage on a failed save, or
half as much damage on a successful one.
If the target dies while under the effects of this
spell, it is consumed by fire and turns into a fire
elemental under the spellcaster’s control, which
requires concentration and lasts for up to 1 minute.
The fire elemental disintegrates when the spell
ends.

From thought you create matter, equipping yourself
with a simple implement you need. You summon
one piece of adventuring gear worth 2 gp or less
which you can hold in one hand, and which must
weigh less than 10 pounds.
If the item is more than 10 feet away from you at
the end of your turn, the spell ends. This object may
simulate the effects of a tool which requires
proficiency, but it can only be used to make one
ability check, for a task that takes 1 round or less,
after which time the spell ends. Anyone who holds
the item or examines it closely can tell it is not real.
When the spell ends, the item disappears.
Create Poison
1st-level transmutation (ritual)
container that can hold a draught of water)
You use some combination of scavenged
substances, focused meditation, and magic to
transform the water in a container you have on your
person into one dose of improvised poison. This
dose can be applied to one weapon, up to three
pieces of ammunition, or up to three separate
portions of food or drink. Once applied, the poison
retains potency until someone must roll a saving
throw against it, or for 1 minute, after which point it
dries or dissolves. If a creature is struck with the
poisoned weapon or ammunition, or if it ingests the
poisoned food or drink, it must make a Constitution
save or be poisoned for 1 minute and take 1d8
poison damage, or 2d8 if the poison is ingested).
Creatures that succeed on their save take half
damage, but suffer no other effects.
A poison you create can only be used by you,
and has no value if you try to sell it. If you cast this
spell again, any doses of poison you have previously
created with this spell instantly become water
again. Otherwise, poison doses created with this
spell retain their potency until the next time you
finish a long rest, at which point they return to
being water.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell
using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you create
one additional dose of poison for every two levels
above 1st. When you cast this spell using a spell slot
of 4th level or higher, the poison gains an extra
effect: if a creature fails the saving throw by 5 or
more, its Constitution score is reduced by 1d4 until
the creature finishes a long rest or its ability score is
restored by magic.
Create Revenant

Duration: Concentration, up to 24 hours
Description:
one black onyx stone worth 250 gp)
You raise one corpse of a Medium or Small
humanoid as a revenant under your temporary
influence. (The DM has game statistics for
revenants).
Once raised, the revenant is friendly to you and
your companions for the duration. It obeys any
verbal commands that you issue to it. The revenant
is under your control for 24 hours, after which time
it stops obeying any command you have given it.
When you cast this spell, you must choose one
unfriendly creature within 1 mile of you on which
you wish to seek revenge, and against whom the
revenant also swears vengeance (though only for
the duration). If you do not choose a target for
vengeance, the revenant ceases to be under your
control.
If you don't issue any commands to the revenant,
it attacks the subject of its sworn vengeance,
moving toward that creature if it can, and defends
itself from hostile creatures. If you cast this spell
while you already have a revenant under your
control from a prior casting of this spell, the
previous spell ends and the existing revenant leaves
your service as described above.
The revenant will not seek revenge against you
for animating it with this spell. Once this spell ends,
however, if you wronged it during its life, or if you
stirred its vengeance against you by any of the
deeds you committed or forced it to commit during
its service to you, it may make you a target for its
vengeance.
If the revenant has vengeance in its heart towards
another creature, it will seek revenge against it once
your control ends. If the revenant does not burn
with the need for vengeance, it becomes a dead
corpse once more.
Once a corpse has been the subject of this spell, it
cannot be transformed into a revenant again by this
spell for 100 years.
“’Tis a very foolish thing to turn a
creature ye just killed into a revenant!”

damage to the creature and blinding it for the

blinded by this spell can repeat the Constitution
saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending
the spell on a success. This spell has no effects on

response to hitting a target with a melee weapon
attack
When you cast this spell, it takes effect after you hit
with the triggering attack but before you roll
damage. Whenever you hit with a melee attack
before the end of your next turn (including on the
triggering attack), your weapon inflicts an extra die
of its normal damage, and you score a critical hit on
a roll of 19 or 20.
For example, if you rolled a 19 to hit an enemy
with a longsword, you could cast critical strike as a
reaction, and make the attack a critical hit. You
would then roll an amount of slashing damage
equal to 4d8 + your Strength modifier (the spell
increases longsword damage from 1d8 to 2d8, and
that is doubled again due to the critical hit).

A round transparent shield about 2 feet in diameter

and follows its movements. For the duration, if you
are the target of, or included in the area of effect of ,
a spell that allows you to save for half damage, you

Dead Man’s Tell
1st-level divination (ritual)
which must be flexible in some way)
You imbue a body part taken from a criminal’s
corpse—such as a hand, finger or head—with
divinatory powers that cause it to react. Choose one
of the categories of things it can detect and react to
below. When something that falls within the chosen
category or selected subcategories comes within 30
feet of the body part that has become the dead
man’s tell item, it activates. You can choose one of
the following categories of things to activate the
dead man’s tell item:
 Alignment. Choose one of the following
alignments: good, evil, lawful, or chaotic. The
dead man’s tell item activates when it is within
30 feet of a creature that has such an alignment.
 Consecration/Desecration. The dead man’s
tell item activates when it is within 30 feet of a
place or object that has been magically
consecrated or desecrated (as with the hallow
spell).
 Creature. Select one or more types of creatures
from the following list: aberrations, beasts,
constructs, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends,
giants, monstrosities, oozes, plants, or undead.
You can also choose one or more races of
humanoids (such as humans or goblins). You
can choose as many or as few of these types as
you like. The dead man’s tell item activates
when it is within 30 feet of one of the chosen
creature types.
 Disease. The dead man’s tell item activates
when it is within 30 feet of an object or creature
that carries a disease with which it can infect
other creatures.
 Magic. Choose magic items, spellcasting,
scrying attempts, or general magical effects. The
dead man’s tell item activates when it is within
30 feet of one of the chosen effects.
 Poison. The dead man’s tell item activates when
it is within 30 feet of poison or poisonous
creatures,
 Secret Door. The dead man’s tell item activates
when it is within 30 feet of a secret door.
 Trap. The dead man’s tell item activates when it
is within 30 feet of a hidden trap or disguised pit
or snare.
The first time the dead man’s tell item detects one
or more of the chosen category or subcategories of
subjects within 30 feet, it activates. When activated,
the item violently spasms for one round; a hand
clenches, a finger jerks, jaws chatter and the like.
The dead man’s tell item does not indicate the
power or location of the subject it has detected,
merely its presence within 30 feet at the time of its
activation. After being activated, the spell ends, and
the body part rapidly decays and dessicates
(meaning the same body part cannot be used for
this spell again once it has been activated).
A creature is not detected by the dead man’s tell
item if it is separated from it by 1 foot of stone, 1
inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet
of wood of dirt, or if it is protected by an effect that
prevents divination (such as a nondetection spell).
The same spellcaster cannot have multiple dead
man’s tell items affected with this spell at once.
When you cast the dead man’s tell spell again, any
previous castings of this spell end immediately.

A restrained creature can attempt to free itself by
using an action on its turn to make a Strength check

Designate a 20-foot radius circle within range.
Ghostly, skeletal hands reach out of the ground,
clawing at everyone within the circle. Choose one
creature in the spell area, which must then make a
Constitution saving throw. If it succeeds, the spell
ends. If it fails, it takes necrotic damage, as per the
following instructions.
Roll 10d10. If the total is less than the creature's
current hit points, it takes the total result as

Description:
stomach acid, and a tooth)
You touch a creature, and it must immediately
make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, one
of its limbs turns into a mindless, hairy spider. On
the target's next turn, the spider twists around and
starts to devour its host. The target then takes 1d6
piercing damage at the start of each of its turns.
Dispel magic can only halt the spell and save the
limb if it is cast before the end of your next turn
after death spider is cast. Otherwise, the spider limb
must be hacked off (15 AC, 40 hp, vulnerable to
slashing damage), which kills the spider. If the
spider is not stopped, it will continue to inflict
damage on its host, consuming it when it reaches 0
hp, and then growing into a giant spider over the
next 24 hours.
“This surely ranks as one of the most
disturbing spells ever devised. It was
created by the Drow as a way to combine
execution with entertainment.”

“Elminster is a wasteful gossip with no
regard for efficiency. This spell replaces
an enemy with a servant, or an
incompetent servant with a better one. I
only wish it were quicker about it.”

Death Talisman
3rd-level necromancy (ritual)
You link your life force to a small item. A knife,
ring, or amulet is typical, but any item can be
chosen. While you remain healthy, the item
remains in perfect shape, never taking and wear or
tear. If it takes damage, it regains hit points
whenever you do, and in the same amount (so, if
you regain 8 hit points, the item also regains 8 hit
points), up to its normal maximum.
If you are killed or suffer the incapacitated,
paralyzed, petrified, stunned, or unconscious
conditions, the talisman becomes rusted and dull.
Once the condition is removed the talisman will
regain its luster. Damaging the item does not harm
you. These effects persist even if you and the item
are not on the same plane. This spell ends if you
cast it again.
“I knew an arcane archer who cast this
spell upon his bow, so as to ensure his
bowstring never snapped.”

that is not behind total cover is near death (at 0 hit
points) or fragile (less than 25% of their hit point
maximum). You also know if a creature is undead,
alive, or neither (an unliving construct, for
example).
If something appears to be a creature, but is not,
or if it is something that has never been alive (such
as a statue), you sense that as well.
This spell does not penetrate illusions (causing
illusory creatures to appear alive), and if a creature
is under the effects of a feign death spell or a similar

As part of the action used to cast this spell, you

normal effects, its speed is reduced by 5 feet for the

throw against this spell, its speed is reduced by an
additional 5 feet (which is cumulative with previous

necrotic damage on the creature at the start of each

A creature suffering from a festering wound can
make a new Constitution saving throw at the end of

Duration: 24 hours
Description:
You utter a primal word of command, forcing
enemies to bow down while your allies better their
tactical positions. Choose up to five creatures you
can see within range. Each one must roll a Wisdom
saving throw, taking 5d10 psychic damage on a
failed save or half as much on a success. Creatures
immune to being charmed have advantage on this
saving throw. Each creature that fails the save also
falls prone, and if it stands up from being prone
before the end of your next turn, doing so provokes
opportunity attacks from any creatures that have it
within their reach.
If at least one creature fails its saving throw, every
ally of your choice with range can immediately use
its reaction to move up to 15 feet.

You imbue a 20-foot radius sphere within range

advantage on their saving throws. If the area
includes an altar to your god, or a desecrated altar
to an enemy god, then any undead in the area also
gain resistance to nonmagical bludgeoning,
piercing, and slashing damage. If an undead
creature is animated, created, conjured, or
summoned in the area, it gains temporary hit points
equal to its Hit Dice as soon as it appears.

speaks a password, a word to activate an item, the
name of a secret location, the direction toward a
hideout, or other similar secret information.
The creature can’t be asked specific questions. At
the end of each of the creature’s turns, it can

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minutes
Description:
You call forth the intangible but terrifying spirits of
ancient dinosaurs, who rise up from beneath the
earth to trample your enemies. You choose a 40-
foot-radius, 20-foot-high cylinder anywhere within
range to contain a herd of stampeding dinosaur
spirits. At least part of this cylinder must be
touching the ground.
When the stampede area appears, each creature

within the stampede area.
While this spell is active, you must use your
bonus action on each of your turns to choose a new
cylinder of the same size within range to be the
stampede area. The center point of the new cylinder
must be at least 15 feet from the center point of the
previous one, but can be no more than 40 feet away

You alter the appearance of an undead creature
with the touch of your hand, masking its undead
nature. You can make the creature appear as it did
in life, or give it the appearance of another race.
However, you can’t change the creature’s general
body type, but you could, for example, make a
zombie or a wight look like a half-elf dressed in fine
clothing. In addition, you can alter its height by one
foot, making it appear taller or shorter, and you can
make it look fat, thin, or anything in between. You
can add small distinctive features to the illusion,
such as a mole on the creature’s face, or a braided
beard. However, the spell doesn’t change the smell,
sound, or tactile features of the undead.
Another creature interacting with the disguised
undead can use an action to make an Intelligence
(Investigation) check against your spell save DC to
detect the disguise. The spell masks the disguised
creature from divination spells that detect undead.
To such a divination spell, the creature appears as
the type of creature the disguise emulates.

You create discordant whispers that fill a 20-foot
radius within range. The whispers start at a low
volume, but quickly rise to a crescendo of blaring
and confusing voices that distract all creatures in
the area. Any spellcaster that attempts to cast a
spell within the area must make a Constitution
saving throw against your spell save DC, or the spell
fails. Likewise, a spellcaster in the affected area that
is concentrating on a spell at the start of its turn
must make a Constitution saving throw against your
spell save DC, or lose concentration on the spell.
In addition, any creature within the area has
advantage on saving throws against spells that
depend upon language, such as charm person.

as much damage on a successful save, and is not
knocked prone. A creature made of inorganic
material such as stone, crystal, or metal has

You point at a creature within range and speak a
verse of utter gibberish. The creature must make a
Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature
must make a Charisma saving throw against your
spellcasting DC whenever it tries to cast a spell with
verbal components, to speak a command word to
activate an item, or to read a scroll, for the spell’s
duration. On a failed save, the creature utters
gibberish instead of the required component,
command word, or scroll wording, and its action is
wasted without producing the desired effect.
In addition, if a creature fails its Wisdom saving
throw, it has disadvantage on all Charisma ability
checks when interacting with other creatures as it
speaks gibberish mixed with its more intelligible
words. The creature can attempt a new saving
throw at the end of each of its turns, and on a
success, the spell ends.

You distract your enemies by opening their

cube within range. All creatures of your choice
within the area must make a Wisdom saving throw

the clouds, the texture of tree bark, the patterns
carved into a stone wall, the temperature and scent
of a breeze, and more.
For the duration, a creature that fails its saving
throw against this spell has disadvantage on
Wisdom (Insight or Perception), and Intelligence

Anyone trying to understand what the

items from the tool box, such as a shovel, 50’ of
rope, a hammer, pitons, or similar. Each item
summoned can weigh up to 20 pounds. You may
have up to ten such items conjured at a time. You
can’t call forth these items if you have already
summoned a set of tools as described above, nor
can you summon a set of tools if you have already
called forth the alternate items described here.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the weight of the
tools you can conjure increases by 5 pounds and the
duration is extended for another hour for each slot
level above 4th.

Name: Dread Carapace
Level: 3
School: Transmutation
Casting Time: 1 bonus action
Range: Self
Components: V, M (a pill bug)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Description:
You surround yourself with a thick black shell that
shimmers with dark magic. Until the spell ends, you
gain a +2 bonus to Armor Class and Constitution
saving throws, and whenever a creature ends its
turn within 5 feet of you, it must make a Wisdom
saving throw unless it is immune to the fightened
condition. On a failure, you can push the creature
up to 15 feet away from you, and it is frightened of
you until the end of its next turn. On a success, you
can push the creature up to 10 feet away from you.
For the spell's duration, you also suffer
disadvantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks.

Name: Dread Mercy
Level: 2
School: Enchantment
Casting Time: 1 reaction, which you take when you
Range: 60 feet
Components: V
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
Description:
reduce a creature within 60 feet to 0 hit points with
a weapon attack
You offer an opponent mercy in exchange for its
cooperation. Choose one creature within range that
you have just reduced to 0 hit points with a weapon
attack. You instead reduce that creature to 1 hit
point and immediately command its surrender. It
must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure,
the creature is frightened of you, but rather than
fleeing, the frightened creature stays where it is and
does not move unless you tell it to.
For the duration, the creature (that failed its save)
will not attack you, and it fearfully obeys any
instructions it can hear and understand that will
not directly harm it (for example, it will not
knowingly drink poison or walk off a cliff).
While affected, the creature will not deliberately
say anything to you that it believes to be a lie,
though it can simply remain silent if you do not ask
any direct questions.
Whenever you or one of your allies attempt to
harm the creature, or if you give it instructions that
would harm it or force it to make a saving throw
against another effect, it repeats its Wisdom saving
throw against this spell, ending the spell on a
success. You always know if a creature has
succeeded or failed on a saving throw against this
spell. When the spell’s effect ends, a creature that
never succeeded on any saving throws against this
spell is unaware it was magically influenced,
believing its fear of you was merely natural.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the duration is
increased to 1 hour. If you cast this spell using a
spell slot of 6th level or higher, the duration is
increased to 8 hours.

Duration: 1 round
Description:
After a feint and an attack against your foe, you
appear defenseless, but otherworldly power
disguises your cunning readiness to capitalize on
their next move. As part of the action used to cast
this spell, you must make a melee attack with a
weapon against one creature within the spell's
range, otherwise the spell fails. On a hit, the target
suffers the attack's normal effects and takes an
additional 1d10 psychic damage, and until the start
of your next turn, you and the target have
advantage on attack rolls against each other, but
disadvantage on attack rolls against all other
creatures.
In addition, the next time the target attacks you
before the start of your next turn, it provokes
opportunity attacks from you and any other allies of
yours within 5 feet of it.

The next time you hit a creature with a weapon
attack before this spell ends, images of you and your
companions as daunting figures discourage your foe
from confronting you. The attack deals an extra 1d8
psychic damage to the target, and you can push the
target up to 5 feet away from you. In addition, the
next time the target makes an attack roll against
you or a creature friendly to you before the end of
its next turn, it takes psychic damage equal to your
spellcasting ability modifier.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the extra damage
increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 1st.

You speak five words of a forgotten language of
terrible evil, striking pain in the mind of your target
as the world seems to darken around you. Choose
one target within range. The target takes 10d6
necrotic damage, and you must make a Wisdom
saving throw against your own spellcasting DC. You
take 5d6 necrotic damage on a failed saving throw
or half as much on a successful one. Whether you
succeed or fail, you are lightly obscured by darkness
until the start of your net turn.
The decision to speak the forbidden tongue this
spell requires should not be made lightly.
Besides the immediate danger, it also makes the
caster known to certain eldritch beings whose
notice is best avoided.”

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour
Description:
You call forth the spirit of warrior
who shared your zealous faith in
life and returns now to harry your
foes. The spirit appears in an
unoccupied space you choose
within range and lasts for the
duration or until you cast this
spell again. Creatures of your
choice within 5 feet of the spirit
take a -2 penalty to Armor Class,
and you and creatures and
friendly to you treat the spirit as
an ally for the purposes of traits,
spells, and class features (such as
a rogue's sneak attack). Creatures
hostile to you cannot move
through the spirit's space. When a
creature leaves a space within 5
feet of the spirit, you can use your
reaction to make a melee spell
attack against that creature. On a
hit, the target takes psychic
damage equal to 1d10 + your
spellcasting ability modifier. On a
miss, the target still takes psychic damage equal to
your spellcasting ability modifier.
As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the
warrior up to 30 feet to any unoccupied space.
The spirit shares your race and wears armor of a
past age. Clerics of deities who are associated with a
particular symbol or weapon (such as the black
hand of Bane or the flaming sword of Tempus)
usually conjure a dreadful warrior bearing that
symbol or weapon.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 4th level of or higher, the damage
increases by 1d10 for every two slot levels above 3rd.
Dream Sight
6th-level divination (ritual)
5,000 gp)
Your body falls into an enchanted slumber and your
spirit ventures into the world. Your spirit is invisible
and has a fly speed of 100’. You can move through
creatures and objects as if they are difficult terrain.
Your spirit cannot be paralyzed, petrified, grappled,
or restrained. You can see and hear as if you were
standing in the same location as your spirit. Your
spirit cannot attack or cast spells; it can just
observe. Creatures and spells that can detect
invisible or ethereal creatures can see your spirit.
When the spell ends, your spirit returns to your
body, and you wake up. If something attacks your
body while your spirit is absent, the spell ends.

For the duration of this spell, whenever you use
your reaction to cast a spell with a casting time of 1
reaction during another creature's turn, you can
cast one more spell of 5th-level or lower that has a
casting time of 1 reaction before the end of that
creature's turn, even though your reaction has
already been used (this is an exception to the rule
that you can only cast one spell of 1st-level or higher
per turn). Spells cast in this way still use spell slots
normally.
In addition, for the duration of this spell, you gain
a +2 bonus on Intelligence (Arcana) checks, and on
all ability checks for your spellcasting ability that do
not already include your proficiency bonus.
“I once encountered a moderately
accomplished wizard with the duel ward
spell in his grimoire, yet he did not have
counterspell inscribed with it. I noted
that without the ability to prepare
counterspell, duel ward was all but
useless, and he said with utter confidence,
‘but one day soon, I will learn that spell
as well.’ And sure enough, he soon did—I
taught it to him!”

School: Transmutation
Casting Time: 10 minutes
Range: 10 feet
Components: V, S, M (a feather, and varies)
Duration: Instantaneous
Description:
A glowing feather quill appears in the air. You can
make the quill copy any writing, script, or runes
that you can see within range onto another suitable
surface that you can see within range. The original
writing remains intact after the duplicate is made.
This spell will make an exact copy of magical
writing without error, such as that from a scroll,
glyph, or a spell from a spell book.
Only a feather is needed as the material
component to copy nonmagical writing from one
source onto another. However, the spellcaster will
need a piece of parchment, a book page, or another
suitable object to duplicate spell scrolls in addition
to the necessary spell components, which are
consumed by the spell in the process. A glyph,
runes, or writing can be copied onto stone, wood, or
another suitable surface, but might not be mobile or
easily carried in many circumstances.
This spell can only duplicate 1st level spell scrolls
(see exception below). In addition, you can’t use a
spell focus to substitute for the components when
copying scrolls.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using
a higher-level spell slot than 4th level, you can copy
a spell scroll one level higher for every two slot
levels above 4th. For example, you could copy a 2nd
level spell scroll with a 6th level spell slot, or a 3rd
level spell scroll with an 8th level slot.

You turn a small pinch of dust into a deadly poison.
If this poison is ingested (such as if you slip it into
their food or drink), the victim must make a
Constitution saving throw. The victim takes 10d8
poison damage on a failed save, or half as much
damage on a successful one. If this reduces its hit
points to 0, it dies.
This poison cannot be detected by non-magical
means. Victims of this spell are left with a residue of

With one stern, commanding word, you gesture to a
point on the ground within range, and the indicated
spot erupts in a shower of rock, dirt, and fire. Each
creature in a 20-foot radius sphere centered on that
point takes 5d6 fire damage and must make a
Dexterity saving throw. A target that fails the saving
throw is knocked prone and takes additional
bludgeoning damage equal to the fire damage. The
fire also ignites flammable objects in the area that
aren't being worn or carried.
After the spell ends, the area of the spell becomes
difficult terrain until it is cleared. Each 5-foot-
square portion of the area requires at least 1 minute
to clear by hand.
Earth-based or fire-based elemental creatures do
not take damage from this spell.

Description:
When you cast this spell, you touch a creature and
grant it an affinity for earth and stone. For the
duration of the spell, the creature has resistance to
damage from creatures or objects made of any kind
of earth (including stone, dust, soil, clay, or
elemental earth), and from earth-based spells and
magical effects. This includes falling rocks, falling
damage from impacting against any kind of earth,
attacks by earth-based creatures (such as clay or
stone golems, gargoyles, earth elementals). Acid
damage and damage from metal objects or creatures
are not considered earth-based for purposes of this

Using your action, you conjure a sphere of barely
perceptible wisps of shadow which amplify doubts
and fears. Choose a point within range. Each
creature in a 20-foot radius sphere centered on that
point must make a Wisdom saving throw. Creatures
that fail the saving throw fall prone and become
frightened of you until the end of your next turn. A
creature must also make the save when it starts its
turn within the sphere. A construct or an undead is
immune to this effect.
As a bonus action on each of your turns until the

feet or push a creature within the sphere's area up
to 15 feet away from you.

Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 30 feet
Components: V
Duration: 1 round
Description:
As part of the action used to cast this spell, you
must make an unarmed strike or weapon attack
against one creature within range. On a hit, the
target suffers the attack's normal effects, and if the
target is concentrating on a spell when this attack
hits, the attack deals extra thunder damage equal to
your spellcasting ability modifier, which creates a
loud noise that can be heard up to 100 feet away. In
addition, if this attack causes the target to make a
Constitution saving throw to maintain
concentration on a spell, that saving throw is made
with disadvantage.
This spell's damage increases when you reach
higher levels. At 5th level, the melee attack deals an
extra 1d6 thunder damage to the target (whether or
not it is concentrating on a spell). This extra
damage increases to 2d6 at 11th level and 3d6 at 17th
level.

Description:
You select a creature within range, and nine small
silvery orbs spring into being, hovering around the
creature and granting it strong magical protection.
As an action on your turn, you can transfer the orbs
(and their protection) to another recipient within
range.
When a spell forces the protected creature to
make a saving throw, or when the creature is
targeted by a spell attack, it can expend one of the
orbs to nullify the spell's effect on it. The protected
creature no longer needs to make a saving throw, or
the spell attack is absorbed. Afterwards, the orb that
blocked the attack fades away.
This spell only protects the creature you chose
with the orbs hovering around it. Other targets
caught in a spell's area are affected normally.
“Casting the spell is easier than
pronouncing it, but I happen to know that,
like many others of his kind, the humble

as long as their weight doesn't exceed what you can
carry.
If you wish, you can also take one creature with
you when you cast this spell, provided that creature
is within 5 feet of you, it is Medium or smaller, and
it is not carrying gear in excess of its carrying
capacity.
When you take a creature with you, each of you
is teleported to an unoccupied space of your choice
within 30 feet. Your new space and that of the
creature you take with you must be within 5 feet of
each other. If either of you would arrive in a place
already occupied by an object or a creature, the
spell fails to teleport either of you.
If the other creature is not willing to be
teleported, it must roll a Charisma saving throw. On
a success, it is not teleported. A creature has
advantage on this saving throw if it can see you,
unless you are in combat with it and it has not yet
taken a turn.
When you use this spell to teleport another
creature, a loud popping sound emanates from that
creature's location when you first cast the spell,
followed by another loud popping sound that
emanates from the creature's new location when it
arrives. Both times, the sound is audible out to 100

A moment of battlefield success grants you a
magical epiphany, allowing you to place a combat
enchantment on your weapon. As part of the action
used to cast this spell, you must make a melee
attack with a weapon against one creature within
the spell's range, otherwise the spell fails. On a hit,
the target suffers the attack's normal effects, and
you draw chronomantic magic energy from the
target's place in time to enchant your weapon. For
the duration, the speed of the target you hit is
reduced by half, you have advantage on melee spell
attacks against the target, and you can use the
melee weapon you attacked with as a spellcasting
focus for any spell you cast. Whether you hit or
miss, until the spell ends, the weapon gains a +1
bonus to its attack and damage rolls, unless it is a
magic weapon that already has a bonus to those
rolls.
At Higher Levels. When you use a spell slot of
5th or 6th level to cast this spell, the weapon's
magical bonus increases to +2. When you cast it
with a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the bonus is
+3.

Level: 2
School: Evocation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M (a plum blossom)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Description:
When you cast this spell, a blade of elemental
energy appears in the hand of a willing creature you
touch. You choose one of the following damage
types when you cast this spell: acid, cold, fire,
lightning, or poison. The elemental blade is the size
and shape of a normal shortsword, but is virtually
weightless. If the wielder lets go of the blade, it
disappears, but until the spell ends, you can evoke it
for the creature again as a bonus action.
The blade sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius
and dim light for an additional 10 feet, and the
wielder can use its action to make a melee attack
with the blade, rolling the attack as if it were
attacking with a regular shortsword. On a hit, the
target takes 2d4 plus your spellcasting ability
modifier damage of the type chosen when this spell
was first cast. Since the blade is immaterial, the
wielder’s Strength or Dexterity modifiers do not
apply to the damage, nor does any extra damage
from special abilities the wielder may possess (such
as sneak attack).
A creature who takes damage from this spell suffers
an additional effect depending on the type of
damage inflicted, as follows:
 Acid. The creature suffers disadvantage on the
next Constitution saving throw it makes before
the start of its next turn (this includes a saving
throw to maintain concentration on a spell
which may be caused by this spell’s damage).
 Cold. Until the end of the creature’s next turn,
its speed is reduced by half and it cannot take
reactions.
 Fire. The creature must immediately choose to
either fall prone to extinguish flames on its body
or be ignited, taking 1d4 fire damage at the end
of each of its turns until it or another creature
within 5 feet takes an action to extinguish the
flames. Creatures wearing metal armor are
immune to this effect.
 Lightning. The creature can’t take reactions
until the start of its next turn and it takes an
extra 1d4 lightning damage if it is wearing metal
armor.
 Poison. The creature is poisoned until the end
of its next turn.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using
a 4th level or higher spell slot, the damage on a hit
increases by ld4 for every two slot levels above 2nd.

School: Transmutation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self
Components: V, S, M (a bit of the chosen element
Duration: Concentration up to 4 hours
Description:
from a plane other than where the spell is cast)
When you cast this spell, it transforms your body
and all the gear you are carrying into a new form,
composed of your choice of one of the following
elements: air, earth, fire, or water. You retain your
previous size and statistics, except as noted below,
but until the spell ends, your creature type becomes
elemental, and you gain the following benefits:
 You are attuned to the environments where this
element completely surrounds you, breathing
and existing in such places comfortably.
 You are immune to poison damage and the
poisoned condition, and to the paralyzed,
stunned, and unconscious conditions.
 You gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing,
and slashing damage from non-magical
weapons.
In addition, you gain the following special abilities
depending on the elemental type you chose:
Air. You can fly at your normal speed. Creatures
have disadvantage on their attack rolls against you
while they are flying or hovering.
Earth. You gain a +1 bonus on attack rolls against
foes that are touching the ground and advantage on
any ability check you make to shove a creature. No
matter what armor you wear, your Armor Class
cannot be lower than 13 + your Dexterity modifier.
Fire. You are immune to fire. Any creature that
grapples you, or is within 5 feet of you when it hits
you with an attack roll, takes 1d6 fire damage. When
you hit with an unarmed strike, you inflict an extra
1d6 fire damage.
Water. You can swim at your normal speed. You
gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls if you
and your opponent are both touching water. You
can use your action to put any nonmagical fire
within 5 feet of you, or to put out any magical fire
within 5 feet of you as if casting dispel magic as a
7th-level spell.
Elemental Burst
=== SPELL END ===

=== SPELL START ===
Name: Elemental Burst
Level: 1
School: Evocation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 30 feet
Components: V, S, M (varies, see description)
Duration: Instantaneous
Description:
You release the magical energy from one of the
elements in an explosive burst. The material
component of this spell depends on the element:
burning incense for air, soft clay for earth, sulphur
and phosphorus for fire, water and sand for water,
or any kind of vegetable matter for wood.
When you cast this spell, you choose a point
within range that contains one of the following five
elements of your choice: air, earth (which includes
soil, metal, or stone), fire, water, or wood. That
material releases its elemental energy. Each creature
within a 15-foot cone emanating from that point
must make a saving throw. The victim takes 2d6
damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on
a successful one.
The type of saving throw required and damage
inflicted depend on the element, as determined by
the following table:
In addition to taking damage, each creature that
fails its saving throw suffers an additional effect,
depending on the element type. These effects are
detailed below, along with descriptions of each
element’s exact effect:
Air. There is a sudden flash of light and peal of
thunder as a gust of wind whips up out of nowhere,
heavy with static electricity that shocks those
nearby. Creatures that fail their save are knocked
prone. Objects that aren’t being worn or carried
become electrified, inflicting 1d6 lightning damage
on the next person who touches them within the
next minute.
Earth. Clumps of metal and rock spray out,
oozing a corrosive substance. Creatures who fail
their save are pushed back 10 feet away from the
point at the center of the effect, as are objects
weighing less than 100 lbs. that aren’t being worn or
carried.
Fire. The fire shoots out glowing sparks. It ignites
flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn
or carried, and creatures who fail their save take an
additional 1d6 damage at the beginning of their next
turn.
Water. Icy water pushes out in a freezing wave
that crashes into those nearby. Creatures who fail
their save reduce their speed by half until the end of
their next turn, and objects weighing less than 100
pounds that aren’t being worn or carried are pushed
back 15 feet away from the point at the center of the
effect.
Wood. The element throws off sharp slivers of
the same material as itself, infused with a poisonous
sap. Creatures who fail their save cannot take
reactions until the end of their next turn. Against
objects, this effect inflicts piercing damage instead
of poison.
The explosive noise of this spell can be heard up
to 100 feet away. The spell does not noticeably affect
the structure of any object that is the source of the
elemental effect, unless it is an object that is not
being worn or carried. If that is the case, the object
suffers the same 2d6 damage as a creature that
failed its saving throw.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using
a 2nd level or higher spell slot, the damage
increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.
“This is one of many extremely useful
spells that originated among the
spellcasters of the continent of Kara-
Tur, where sages identify five elements
instead of four. Unfortunately, the
mages of that land are far better than
those of Faerûn at keeping their secrets...
So good, in fact, that I know the ways of
spellcasters on distant planes better
than I know those native to the continent
that adjoins my own! To this day, it be
unclear to me whether the creator was a
member of the mystic order known as the
wu-jen, or one of the divinely inspired
sorcerers called the shugenja.”

Duration: Instantaneous
Description:
The target of this spell becomes very physically
beautiful, with a subtle glow surrounding it in
shadows, and tiny motes of light clinging to it in
sunlight. The target gains advantage on all
Charisma checks until the spelle ends.
“This effect is very similar to that of spells such
as charm person, but Elonia Starre—that skilled
illusionist of Raven’s Bluff, as well-known for
her prowess as a businesswoman and
beautician as for her magic—cleverly crafted a
spell that locates the enchantment in the caster,
rather than in those the caster seeks to charm.
As a result, this spell bypasses many natural
resistances and immunities, and does not
violate the sanctity of any creature’s mind.”

Embalming Touch
2nd-level necromancy (ritual)
You preserve one corpse against the ravages of time.

Duration: 1 minute
Description:
This spell incites and enrages animals, making them
hostile and vicious. Roll 6d10; the total is how many
hit points of creatures this spell can affect. Eligible
beasts within 30 feet of a point you choose within
range are affected in ascending order of their
current hit points (ignoring unconscious creatures,
non-beasts, or beasts with an Intelligence score of 4
or higher, who are unaffected).
Starting with the creature that has the lowest
current hit points, each creature affected by this
spell enters a terrible rage for the duration. Subtract
each creatures’ hit points from the total before
moving on to the creature with the next lowest hit
points. A creature’s hit points must be equal to or
less than the remaining total for that creature to be
affected.
A beast that is magically bound to a master or
trained only to attack on order is allowed a Wisdom
saving throw against this effect; other beasts are
not. Creatures who succeed on their saving throws
are still deducted from the total number of hit
points of creatures you can affect.
At the beginning of its turn, an affected creature
must make a melee attack against a creature within
reach. If a beast affected by this spell has no
creatures within reach, it will move towards the
nearest creature and attack. If it cannot do so for
some reason, the beast attacks an object within
range, which may be the ground or a wall.
The first two attacks by beasts enraged by this
spell are made with advantage.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, roll an additional
2d10 for each slot level above 1st. When you cast it
with a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can also
affect abominations, celestials, fey, and fiends that
have assumed an animal form (such as familiars).

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Description:
When you cast this spell, it creates a spherical
storm with hurricane force winds that whip
violently around you in a 40-foot radius sphere
centered on you. However, within a 10-foot radius
sphere also centered on you, these winds are
relatively calm, merely a strong breeze.
Because of the winds, creatures within 40 feet of
you cannot make ranged attack rolls, nor can they
be the targets of ranged attacks. Certain large
projectiles, such as thrown or catapulted boulders,
can be used to attack despite the winds, but even
attacks with such weapons are made at
disadvantage.
Any creature that moves into the area of the
violent winds or starts its turn there must make a
Strength saving throw. If they fail, they suffer one of
the following effects, depending on their size and
whether they are flying.
 Medium and smaller creatures are moved 1d4 x
10 feet in a random direction, knocked prone,
and take 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage for
every 10 feet this effect moves them.
 Medium flying creatures are pushed back 1d6 x
10 feet.
 Large creatures are knocked prone.
 Large flying creatures are pushed 1d6 x 5 feet.
 Huge creatures make no progress through the
winds.
 Huge flying creatures are pushed 1d4 x 5 feet.
You can move at half your movement speed while
concentrating on the storm, and it moves with you.
However, if your movement causes the storm’s
winds to cross into a space occupied by another
creature, the creature must make a Strength saving
throw to avoid the spell’s effects.

+5 bonus on that attack roll. Until the spell ends,
you can also see invisible creatures and objects as if
they were visible, and you can see into the Ethereal
Plane. Ethereal creatures and objects appear ghostly
and translucent.
Once before the spell ends, when a creature you
can see makes a successful attack roll that would hit
one of your allies, you can use your reaction to force
that creature to reroll the attack roll with
disadvantage. It must use the lower of the two
attack rolls. Once you use your reaction for this
effect, the spell ends immediately.

Duration: Until dispelled or triggered
Description:
least 100 gp, which the spell consumes)
You create a magical trap that takes the form of
massive poisonous fangs when activated. When you
cast this spell, you create a magical trap tied to a
surface (such as a table or a section of floor or wall)
or an object that can be closed (such as a book, a
scroll, or a treasure chest). While casting this spell,
you physically trace the area of the surface or the
outline of the object to be trapped. If you choose a
surface, the area of the surface can be no larger than
20 feet in diameter. If you choose an object, that
object must remain in its place; if the object is
moved more than 20 feet from where you cast this
spell, the spell ends without being triggered.
You decide what triggers the trap when you cast
the spell. For fang traps placed on a surface, most
typical triggers include touching or standing on the
trapped surface, removing another object covering
the surface, or approaching within a certain
distance of the surface area. For fang traps inscribed
within an object, the most common triggers include
opening that object, approaching within a certain
distance of the object, or manipulating the object in
a pre-described way. Once a fang trap is triggered,
this spell ends.
You can further refine the trigger so the spell
activates only under certain circumstances or
according to physical characteristics (such as height
or weight), creature kind (for example, the ward
could be set to affect aberrations or drow), or
according to whether or not the creature has
immunity to poison damage or the poisoned
condition. Unlike a glyph of warding, it can’t be
made to activate on the basis of alignment. You can
also set conditions for creatures that don’t trigger
the fang trap, such as those who say a certain
password. You are unable to trigger the fang trap
yourself.
Any creature that sees you cast this spell knows
the exact area affected, and immediately makes an
Intelligence (Arcana) check against your spell save
DC, gaining advantage on that check. If the creature
succeeds, it also knows what triggers the trap.
Otherwise, the fang trap’s presence is almost
undetectable and requires a successful Intelligence
(Investigation) check against your spell save DC to
be noticed.
When the fang trap discharges, the object or
surface grows huge fangs that immobilize the
creature who triggered it. The creature is restrained
until the beginning of its next turn. At the
beginning of its next turn, it must make a
Constitution saving throw. If it succeeds, it is no
longer restrained. If it fails, it takes 2d8 piercing
damage, 2d8 poison damage, and 2d8 psychic
damage, and remains restrained for 1 minute.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the psychic
damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above
4th.

“Given the world of the Eberron’s separation from the larger

You draw on magic of the Feywild to quickly

you can teleport up to 10 feet to any unoccupied
space where the triggering creature would be within
the reach of your melee weapon. As part of the same
reaction, you can immediately make one melee
weapon attack against the triggering creature. The
amount of damage inflicted by this attack cannot be
higher than your spellcasting ability modifier.
The damage of attacks you make with this spell
increases when you reach higher levels. At 5th level,
the melee attack deals an extra 1d4 radiant damage
to the target. This extra radiant damage increases to
2d4 at 11th level and 3d4 at 17th level. Whenever you
add this radiant damage to the damage of your
weapon attack, the maximum amount of damage
the attack can inflict is equal to the amount of
radiant damage + your spellcasting ability modifier.
“Magic of the Feywild is notoriously untrustworthy, but the
eladrin who created this defensive spell knew their craft. It
efficiently draws energy from their home plane and enables
consistent, limited teleportation in battle, while requiring no
more than a neophyte’s level of magical power.”

Constitution saving throw. If it fails, it takes 8d6
slashing damage, and its Charisma score is reduced
by 2d4. If it succeeds, it takes half as much slashing
damage, and its Charisma is unaffected. Half of the
reduction in Charisma from failing this last saving
throw is permanent.
If a target’s hit points are reduced to 0 by this
spell, the target immediately dies as the flesh is
ripped away from its bones. The target’s Charisma
cannot drop below 1.
The slashing damage can be healed normally. The
reduction to Charisma can be healed by the
regenerate spell, by the wish spell, or by resting for
48 hours after the hit point damage has been
healed, except for any permanent reduction, which
cannot be healed by anything short of a wish.
“This spell is a favorite of twisted minds
everywhere. I have used it but once, to my
lasting regret. There are some things ye
can never unsee.”

"One of the joys of magical lore—or
frustrations, depending on how ye view
it—is that no matter how many centuries
of intense study ye devote, some mysteries
yet beckon.
“For me, I think the relationship of the
mystical force known as ki to magic shall
ever be such. Like a bird that flits away
whenever ye come close, whenever I think
the answer is within my grasp, it vanishes
in the face of some new wrinkle or
contradiction.
“In certain nations of Kara-Tur, where
an advanced study of ki is made, a battle
cry like the one this cantrip creates is
often called a kiai, and is considered an
achievement of martial skill, rather than
true magic. Perhaps this cantrip was
created to emulate such displays?"

from the other portal as if the two were adjacent to
each other; passing through a portal from the
nonportal side has no effect. On your turn, you can
rotate the rings as a bonus action so that the active
side faces in a different direction.
The surface of the first portal is transparent,
allowing you to see what lies beyond; however, the

Sowing the chaos of Pandemonium, you scramble
your speech and the speech of others. Choose one
creature within range that can hear you. The target
must roll a Wisdom saving throw, suffering 2d10
psychic damage on a failed save or half as much on

Name: Glamour Blade
Level: 3
School: Illusion
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 5 feet
Components: V, M (a weapon)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Description:
As part of the action used to cast this spell, you
must make a melee attack with a weapon against a
creature within range, otherwise the spell fails. On a
miss, the spell ends. On a hit, the target suffers the
attack's normal effects, and the air shimmers
around you as an illusory duplicate of you appears
in an unoccupied space of your choice within 5 feet
of the target. If no such space exists, the spell fails.
Until the spell ends, the duplicate persists,
appearing to be a living, breathing, active version of
you. If the target ends its turn more than 60 feet
away from the duplicate, or if you end your turn
more than 60 feet away from the duplicate, the spell
ends. The duplicate mimics your actions to a
degree, but no matter where you are, it seeks to
remain close to the target.
If the target ends its turn more than 5 feet away
from the duplicate, the duplicate moves up to 60
feet to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the
target. If no such space exists, the duplicate moves
to the unoccupied space closest to the target.
While the duplicate is within 5 feet of the target,
you can make melee attacks against the target as if
it were within 5 feet of you, just as if you were
attacking from the space the duplicate is occupying.
If you hit the target with a melee attack roll while it
is within 5 feet of
the duplicate,
the attack inflicts
additional
psychic damage
equal to 1d6 +
your spellcasting
ability modifier.
While you are
within 5 feet of
your duplicate,
whenever an
attack roll is
made against
you, you can use
your reaction to
roll a d20. If you
roll an 11 or
higher on the
die, the attack
targets the
duplicate instead
of you.
The duplicate’s
AC equals your
spellcasting DC. If an attack hits a duplicate, the
duplicate is destroyed. A duplicate can be destroyed
only by an attack that hits it. It ignores all other
damage and effects. If the duplicate is destroyed,
the spell ends.

You summon the strength and horrific majesty of a
terrifying princess of the Nine Hells to wreak havoc
upon your enemies. As part of the action used to
cast this spell, you can move up to 30 feet. For each
5 feet you move, you can choose one creature
within 5 feet that you haven’t yet attacked as a part
of this spell, and make a melee spell attack against
that creature. On a hit, the target takes 8d6 necrotic
damage, and you push it 5 feet away from you.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 8th level or higher, the number of feet
you move as part of this spell is increased by 10 feet
for each slot level above 7th.
“This spell is, of course, named for the
archdevil Glasya, duchess of the Sixth, a
Princess of the Nine Hells, the daughter
of Asmodeus, and—like all her kind—a
terrible host. It is said she first granted
this spell to a warlock who served her via
an infernal pact. Since that time, it has
been adapted for the use of all warlocks,
whether their pact is merely reckless
(such as taking on one of the Summer Fey
monarchs as a patron) or self-
destructively foolish (such as bartering
for power with one of the mad entities of
the Far Realm).
“Despite its widespread use, most
warlocks still prefer to avoid this spell
for its diabolical associations—those
warlocks who have a pact with her being
notable exceptions.”

high cylinder centered on that point. Until the spell
ends, you can use an action on each of your turns to
move the whirlwind up to 30 feet in any direction
along the ground. The whirlwind sucks up any large
or smaller objects in its area that aren’t secured,
worn, or carried by any creature.
A creature must make a Dexterity saving throw
the first time on a turn that it enters the whirlwind’s
area, or when the whirlwind enters its space,
including when the whirlwind first appears. A
creature takes 15d6 bludgeoning damage on a failed
saving throw, or half that on a successful one. In
addition, a Huge or smaller creature that fails its
save must succeed on a Strength saving throw or
become restrained within the whirlwind. A
restrained creature is pulled 5 feet higher at the
start of each of its turns while inside the whirlwind
unless it is already at the top. The creature moves
with the whirlwind and falls when the spell ends,
unless it has some means to stay aloft.
A creature restrained by the whirlwind can use an
action to make a Strength or Dexterity check
against the spellcaster’s save DC. On a success, the
creature is no longer restrained, and it is hurled 3d6
x 10 feet in a random direction. A thrown creature
takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage per 10 feet thrown if
it strikes a solid object.

When this spell is cast, your heart is replaced with
an ornately crafted stone heart. For the spell’s
duration, your living heart is stored in a special
alchemical solution at a hidden location, which you
have either prepared and chosen previously, or
which you choose during the casting of this spell
from among locations you have been to in the last
24 hours.
The stone heart grants you resistance to cold, fire,
and lightning damage, as well as resistance to
damage from bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing
weapons.
However, the stone heart also has the following
disadvantages:
 You can only gain a maximum of 1 hit
point per hit die when you heal naturally.
 You instantly die if your living
heart is damaged or destroyed.
 A creature that can see the location
of your heart or is close enough to
hear it beating can find it, but only
if they are actively searching for it.
The DC for ability checks to find
your heart is equal to your
spellcasting DC.
In addition, the heart of stone
can be dispelled, which transfers
your living heart back to your
body, and sends your stone heart
to your living heart's previous
hiding place. If you enter an anti-
magic field, your stone heart and
living heart temporarily switch
places, and then switch back again
after you leave the affected area.

The first time that a spell that targets you either
forces you to make a saving throw or targets you
with a spell attack, roll 1d4 + 5. If the number rolled
equals or exceeds the level of the spell, that spell
fails to affect you, and is turned back upon its

caster is now the one who must make the saving
throw against your spellcasting DC; if it was
targeting you with a spell attack, the caster is now
the target of that spell attack using your spell attack
bonus.
For the spell’s duration, each additional time a
spell that targets you either forces you to make a
saving throw or targets you with a spell attack,
repeat the process as above but subtract the level of
any spells previously turned from the result’s total.
If the total still equals or exceeds the level of the

for 1 hour. On a successful save, a creature isn't
affected by this spell.

Your weapon buzzes with toxic energy as you infuse
it with magic, and when it strikes your target it
emits a cloud of hornet-like motes that sting your
foe and nearby enemies. As part of the action used
to cast this spell, you must make a ranged weapon

poison damage. On a successful save, the spell ends.
For the duration of the spell, a creature that

during its turn or starts its turn there is attacked by
the motes and must make a Constitution saving
throw. The creature takes 2d6 poison damage on a
failed save, or half as much damage on a successful
one.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using

You choose a 20-foot-by-20-foot sphere within
range, creating an invisible web of energy in that
area that immediately stops any creature flying or
falling into its strands. A creature that flies into the
web must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a
failed save, the creature’s speed drops to 0, and it is
grappled by the web. However, it can use an action
to make a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check against your
spellcasting DC to break free.
Although the web of energy reduces a creature’s
speed to 0, it isn’t restrained, and it doesn’t fall to
the ground. It is simply held in place in mid-air, and
it can act normally.

choose within range. The target must make a
Dexterity saving throw to avoid being grappled by
the chain. On a failed save, the target is grappled by
the chain as it twists and writhes around it, causing
the creature to have disadvantage on attack rolls
and ability checks while it is grappled. In addition,
on each of your turns, you can use an action to
make a melee spell attack against the grappled
target. On a hit, the target takes 3d6 piercing
damage. The victim can attempt a Dexterity saving
throw at the end of each of its turns to avoid being
grappled by the chain. On a success, the target
breaks free.
If a target escapes before the spell ends, you may

the target cannot cast that spell by any means.

spells, it loses one spell slot instantly when you cast
this spell. The lost spell slot is of the highest level
for which the creature currently has slots. After this
spell ends, the spell slot is regained.

would lose the ability to cast is 9th-level, make an
ability check using your spellcasting ability. The DC
equals 10 + the spell’s level. On a success, this spell
works normally. On a failure, the target can make
an Intelligence saving throw to negate the effects of
this spell entirely.

“Khelben Arunsun, the first Blackstaff of Waterdeep, created

“A shocking number of his plane’s powerful mages perished
in its past century of magical chaos, Khelben among them.
Given his power and influence, it is hard for me to credit the
small number of spell’s bearing his name to humility.
“I note that neither Khelben’s close friend Elminster nor the
love of his life Laeral have commented on this matter here. Nor
did either leave a note on

the Simbul, the Witch-Queen of Aglarond, before being slain
in battle with the Red Wizards of Thay.
“As the Simbul was Laeral’s sister, and Elminster’s lover,

One arm transforms into a gnarled tree branch.
Your hand becomes a thick knotted fist, you cannot

The limb constantly twitches and can grow
suddenly to crush enemies. For the duration, you
can make a melee spell attack against any creature
within 15 feet. If you hit, the target takes 2d6 plus
your spellcasting ability modifier bludgeoning
damage. This is considered magic for the purposes
of overcoming damage reduction.
Laeral's Crowning Touch
gp per Hit Die of the target)
You magically inscribe a glowing symbol of Mystra,
goddess of magic, on a creature, cursing it with that
goddess's fury. The target must make a Wisdom
saving throw. Creatures that cast spells as a bard,
sorcerer, warlock, or wizard (including arcane
tricksters and eldritch knights) make this saving
throw at disadvantage. On a failure, until the spell
ends, the target has disadvantage on all Intelligence,
Wisdom, and Charisma checks, all spell attack rolls,
and all saving throws against spells. For the same
duration, all saving throws against spells cast by the
target are made at advantage, and the symbol you
inscribed on the target sheds dim light in a 5-foot
radius around it.
While a target is under the effects of this spell,
each time it casts a spell of 1st-level or higher, it
must make a Constitution saving throw. On a
failure, it takes damage equal to twice the spell's
level. Whenever a creature with hair takes this
damage, streaks of silver appear in its hair. If this
damage reduces it to 0 hit points, the target's hair
becomes completely silver.
The inscribed symbol of Mystra appears drawn in
silver on each palm (or on the chest and forehead of
beings lacking palms).
This spell cannot be dispelled by any other spell
except for wish, but it can be countered by
counterspell. When this spell ends, all of its effects
end as well, except for any changes to the target's
hair, which remain permanently as if they were the
target's natural hair color.
“Our goddess Mystra inspired me to research
this spell, intended only for use against beings
who misuse arcane magic, which is granted by
Mystra via the Weave. The Lady of Mysteries
does not look kindly on mages who hurl deadly
magic at every spellcaster who insults them,
nor those who use the Art to deceive or exert
baleful influence over others.
“Mystra has been known to shorten the
effects on the truly repentant and the
undeserving, if they pray to her for forgiveness
and obtain the willing spiritual guidance of a
cleric of Mystra.”
—Laeral Silverhand
Laeral's Cutting Hand
You alter the structure of your hand so that it
becomes as hard and sharp as a blade. Until the
spell ends, your unarmed strikes inflict magical
slashing damage instead of bludgeoning damage,
and you make unarmed strikes with a magical +1
bonus to attack and damage rolls.
For the duration, once during each of your turns,
you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus action.
At Higher Levels. When you use a spell slot of
3rd, 4th, or 5th level to cast this spell, the magical
bonus increases to +2. When you use a spell slot of

You create a number of false magical auras which
blink in and out of the perceptions of any creature
that can sense magic, moving from object to object
as they do so. Choose a point within range. Within a
30-foot radius sphere centered on that point, any
saving throw made against a divination spell is
made with advantage, and the true magical (or
nonmagical) natures creature or objects cannot be
detected. The detect magic and identify spells, and
other effects that detect or discern magical
properties, do not yield any useful information.
Spells and magical effects that detect creature types,
such as a paladin’s divine sense or the trigger of a
symbol spell, are also ineffective within the area.
Each creature or object in the area appears
magical one moment, or nonmagical the next, and

main purpose of the spell is to deter would-be
thieves.
A creature trained in thieves’ tools and proficient
with the Investigation skill can spend an action to
make an Intelligence (Investigation) check with
disadvantage against your spellcasting DC. On a
successful check, the creature detects the ruse, and

Whether the attack hits or misses, a column of
psychic fire consumes it and the creatures around it.

In addition, each creature besides the target who
fails the Wisdom saving throw becomes indifferent
towards the target and forgets the target ever
existed, as if its memories were altered by a modify

that time, the creatures take no action to cooperate
with the target and make no special effort to keep it
from harm. If it is in a position of authority, affected
creatures do not obey its orders. When the effect
ends, all affected creatures regain their normal
memories.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the psychic
damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above
5th.
“There is said to exist a greater chainfire
spell, which can erase all memory of the
target from existence. If this spell did
once exist, it is now apparently
forgotten.”

“Heartened to see that my dear friend
Elminster chose not to make a joke here,
instead letting the irony speak for itself.
Perhaps, after a thousand years of life, even
archmages such as ourselves can still grow and
mature. Perhaps…”

Greater chainfire is not entirely

Lesser Fabricate

=== SPELL START ===
Name: Lesser Fabricate
Level: 2
School: Transmutation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 50 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour
Description:
You convert raw materials into products of the same
material. For example, you could fabricate an oar
from a wooden limb, or a shirt from a clump of
wool.
Choose raw materials that you can see within
range. You can fabricate a Medium or smaller object
(contained within a 5-foot cube, or eight connected
2.5 -foot cubes), given sufficient quantity of raw
material. If you are working with metal, stone or
another mineral substance, however, the fabricated
object can be no larger than Small (contained
within a single 2.5-foot cube). The quality of objects
created by this spell is commensurate with the
quality of the raw materials.
Creatures or magic items can’t be created by this
spell. You also can’t use it to create items that
require a high degree of craftmanship, such as
jewelry, weapons, glass, or armor, unless you have
proficiency with the type of artisan’s tools used to
craft such objects.
Lesser Guardian Seal
4th-level abjuration (ritual)
You target a closable object (a door, window, box
etc.) and name one creature type. Any creature of
that type cannot open that object. The creature also
cannot damage the object, nor attempt to pick or
break the lock. If another creature tries to break the
lock or damage the object, the object also becomes
resistant to all damage and the DC to break the
object increases by 10. Casting knock on the object
suppresses lesser guardian seal for 1 minute.

Components: V, S, M (a tiny shield of wood, glass,
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Description:
or crystal)
The person touched is immune to nonmagical metal
for the duration of the spell. Metal items pass
through you, and cause no harm. You can also walk
through metal barriers, such as gates or bars.
Magical metal objects affect you normally, as do
spells. Secondary effects delivered by metal items
affect you normally, such as a poisoned weapon
attack.
If the spell expires while metal is inside you, the
object is shunted out of your body or you are
pushed away from it to the nearest unoccupied
space; as a result, you and the object both take 1d6
bludgeoning damage.
Since you pass through metal objects, your
unarmed attacks ignore metal armor while you are
under the effects of this spell. This does not change
the Armor Class of a creature wearing metal armor,
but it grants you advantage on unarmed attack rolls
against such creatures.
Lesser Water to Poison

Name: Lesser Water to Poison

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Description:
creature within 30 feet drinks
which is partially water, with which you make a
toasting gesture to the target as you both drink)
Waiting for just the right moment, you transform
the water someone is drinking into deadly poison.
The quantity of water does not matter, just that the
target drinks more than a sip. It can also be a
beverage that is partially water (such as wine, beer,
or juice).
The creature who drinks makes a Constitution
saving throw. On a failure, the creature is poisoned
for the duration, and they take 4d8 poison damage.
If the creature fails the saving throw by 5 or more,
its Constitution score is reduced by 1d4. On a
success, the creature can choose to spit the water
out and take no damage, or continue to swallow it
and take half damage. If the creature failed its save,
at the start of each of the creature's turns before the
spell ends, it must succeed on a Constitution saving
throw or take 4d8 poison damage. On a successful
save, the spell ends.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can affect one
additional creature who is drinking at the same
time, and the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot
level above 4th.
Liberating Memory

Range: Self
Components: V
Duration: 1 round
Description:
would be afflicted with one of the conditions listed
in this spell description
You call to mind a long-forgotten memory that
helps you resist a condition that would dominate or
impede you. This memory may even come from
some kind of previous incarnation rather than your
current lifetime. You spend a Hit Die, but do not
regain any hit points. Instead, you prevent yourself
from suffering one of following conditions that
would otherwise afflict you: blinded, deafened,
paralyzed, poisoned, or restrained.
Once you cast this spell, until the end of your
next turn, your speed is halved and you cannot take
reactions. You must have at least one Hit Die when
you cast this spell, otherwise, the spell fails.
“The spell
liberating memory is highly useful, and under
the right circumstances it can be quite enlightening as well. It
was created by members of the Transcendent Order, also called
the Ciphers, a faction native to the Outer Planar
settlements,,particularly Sigil. They teach that the path to
enlightenment comes from knowing your body and learning to
listen to what existence is telling you to do instead of what your
mind is saying.
“This emphasis on trusting instinct over intellect and seeking
all answers from within may work for some spellcasters, but for
wizards, relying on logic and learning remains the most
advisable strategy.”

Life Steal
5th-level necromancy (ritual)
You pull pure life force out of your victim. The
target must immediately make a Wisdom saving
throw. On a failed save, the target takes 6d6
necrotic damage, or half as much on a success.

throw, you are healed by the amount of damage
dealt. Alternatively, you can transfer these hit
points to an ally that you touch when you cast the
