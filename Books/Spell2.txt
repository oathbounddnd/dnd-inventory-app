You create a 120-foot wide by 60-foot deep swirling
vortex that forms in a water source you can see
within range. If the water source isn’t at least the
size of the vortex, the spell fails. A creature in the
water that is caught within 60 feet of the vortex
must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed
save, the creature is sucked into the vortex’s
swirling waters.
A creature that starts its turn within the vortex’s
swirling waters must make a Dexterity saving
throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d6
bludgeoning damage, and it is sucked 10 feet closer
to the vortex’s center. On a successful save, the
creature doesn’t take damage, and isn’t sucked
closer to the vortex’s center. In addition, the
creature can use its action to make a Strength
(Athletics) check to swim away from the vortex’s
center. On a success, the creature can swim at half
its speed, unless it has a swimming speed, in which
case it can use this full movement. On a failed
check, the creature doesn’t make any progress.
A creature that starts its turn in the vortex’s
center, must make a Strength saving throw. On a
failed save, the creature takes 2d6 bludgeoning
damage and it is sucked 10 feet below the water’s
surface. A creature that reaches the vortex’s bottom,
60 feet below the surface, is ejected a further 20 feet

You cause a grasping, clawed arm of living molten
earth like that of a magmin to erupt from the

Magnetism
=== SPELL END ===

=== SPELL START ===
Name: Magnetism
Level: 3
School: Transmutation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: S, M (a lodestone)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Description:
This spell allows you to draw iron or steel objects to
yourself by projecting a magnetic ray. Choose one
object within range that is nonmagical and made of
ferrous metal. This object must weigh less than 40
lbs. If the object isn’t being worn or carried, it
immediately flies into your space, where you can
either catch it with your hand (requiring no action)
or let it fall at your feet.
Using an action each round, you can target one
object you can see within range of the spell with
this effect.
If an object you target with this spell is being held
or carried by a creature, that creature must roll a
Strength saving throw. On a failure, the creature
drops the object, and it flies to your space, where
you either catch it with your hand or let it fall at
your feet. If the object is being worn by a creature
(like a helm or a chain shirt), the creature makes
the same Strength saving throw but has advantage
on the roll. On a failure, the creature is pulled up to
60 feet towards you if it is Medium-size or smaller.
If the item is secured in some way (such as being
chained to a wall or tied down with a rope), but not
being held or worn, you make an ability check to
break the restraint, as if you were making a Strength
check to break or burst whatever is securing it with
your own hands. Instead of making a Strength
check, you make a check with your spellcasting
ability score (adding your proficiency bonus). If the
check succeeds, you free the item and it flies to your
space as described above.
You can also attempt to move a metal creature
that weighs less than your limit for this spell (such
as a Tiny construct). The creature makes a Strength
saving throw with advantage against this effect. If
the save fails, you can move the creature toward you
just as you would any other metal object.
Until this spell ends, your ability to carry, lift,
push, or drag any objects you have moved to your
space with this spell is calculated as if you had a
Strength score of 20 (giving you a carrying capacity
of 300 pounds and allowing you to push, lift, or drag
up to 600 pounds, if you are Small or Medium
sized), unless your Strength if higher.
If you move during the spell’s duration, you can
choose any object that you moved to your space
with this spell which you are not carrying, lifting,
pushing, dragging, or wearing to either move with
you as you go (levitating just above the level of your
feet) or remain in the square you moved it to.
Once you move an object to your space with this
spell, you have advantage on saving throws and
opposed rolls against dropping it, and creatures
seeking to move the item from your space have
disadvantage on rolls to do so. When the spell ends,
if you are holding, wearing, or carrying an object
that is too heavy for you, it falls softly to the
ground, landing harmlessly at your feet.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the weight limit of
objects you can move with this spell increases by 10
pounds for each slot level above 3rd. When you cast
this spell using a spell slot of 5th or 6th level, you
can choose up to two objects within range each
time you use your action for this spell, instead of
just one. If the spell slot is 7th level or higher, you
can choose up to three objects instead.

=== SPELL START ===
Name: Major Telekinetic Weapon
Level: 2
School: Conjuration
Casting Time: 1 bonus action
Range: Self
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Description:
You summon a simple or martial weapon weighing
no more than 20 lbs that normally costs no more
than 75 gp. It appears in your free hand, ready to be
wielded, and lasts for the duration. It is a magical
weapon made of your psychic energies. If you let go
of the weapon, it disappears, but you can evoke the
weapon again as a bonus action.
You can use your spellcasting ability instead of
Strength or Dexterity for the attack rolls of melee
attacks using this weapon. On a hit, it deals force
damage equal to 2d6 + your spellcasting ability
modifier, instead of the normal damage for a
weapon of that type. If the weapon normally has the
ammunition property, this version does not have
that property, but you must go through the physical
motions of loading it normally as part of the spell
(thus, a weapon with the loading property retains
that property as a telekinetic weapon). Attacking
with a weapon that normally has the ammunition
property creates temporary magical ammunition
that you use normally as part of the attack, but that
ammunition ceases to exist after the attack hits or
misses and any damage is inflicted.
Though it is no more delicate than a common
version of that weapon, your telekinetic weapon
manifests as a semi-transparent solid the same color
as your eyes. This weapon has the simplest possible
geometric shape it can have while still functioning
as the chosen type of weapon. At the end of the
spell's duration, it dissipates harmlessly.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 4th level or higher, it gains a magical
+1 bonus to attack rolls, and inflicts an additional
1d6 force damage on a hit. When you use a spell slot

cube)
You surround yourself with a glossy nimbus of
energy that looks like a gelatinous layer of thick,
dirty water to observers, but does not hinder you in
the least. For the duration of the spell, you gain the
following benefits:
 Oozes with an Intelligence of 3 or lower will not
attack you unless you attack them or force them
to make a saving throw.
 You are immune to poison damage.
 You are immune to the paralyed, poisoned,
restrained, and stunned conditions.
 You are immune to any spell or effect that
would alter your form.
 Magic can’t put you to sleep.
 When an attack that hits you is a critical hit or
sneak attack, you gain resistance to its damage
“This spell began as a special gift given by Ghaunadaur, the
god of oozes, slime, and abominations, to his clerics. He is
sometimes known as the Elder Eye, though his relationship to
the Elder Elemental Eye is unclear. Originally a member of
the drow pantheon, the Elder Eye was touched by the Far
Realm and chose to leave the Inner Planes and strike off on his
own.
“Since that time, his only known allies have been two beings
now believed dead, the mold god Moander and the archomental
Bwimb, Baron of Ooze. Ghaunadaur’s enemies, however, are
many, including all the gods of elves and all the other gods of
the Underdark.
“Some say that Lolth spurned Ghaunadaur's romantic
interests, driving him to fit of fury in which he made his
greatest worshipers mad or mindless. If such an event did occur,
it was fortuitous, since in ancient times some slimes and oozes
possessed great intelligence. If this were still the case, today they
would pose a dire threat.”

that you grapple or is grappled by you takes 1d6
piercing damage at the start of your turn. On your

against the creature. If you hit, you inflict 1d6 plus
your Strength modifier piercing damage.

7th-level enchantment (ritual)
with the target’s name and especially consecrated
for this purpose, detailing the crimes (real or
imagined) for which the subject is being
condemned)
You permanently place a mark upon a character or
creature that identifies it as an enemy of your faith.
The chosen creature suffers the following effects:
 Any member of your faith feels innately hostile
towards the chosen creature, giving it
disadvantage on Charisma (Deception,
Performance, or Persuasion) checks against
members of your faith. This hostility might not
induce the viewer to attack, but the creature
will instinctively distrust or disbelieve anything
the marked one says.
 Members of your faith have advantage on
Wisdom checks against the chosen creature.
 The marked creature cannot benefit from any of
your faith’s services, such as spellcasting
provided by a temple of your faith, or naming,
marrying, or burial services.
You can place the mark of the unfaithful upon
any creature, even if it is on a different plane. You
cannot cast this spell on someone who is already
dead. Clerics, druids, paladins, and rangers of your
faith automatically detect this effect simply by
looking at the subject.
The effect is permanent until lifted, either by you

dispel magic or counterspell, though it can be
copied or undone using a wish.

your next turn. This effect
ends early if someone else
marks the creature. While it is
within 5 feet of you, a creature
marked by you has
disadvantage on any attack roll
that doesn't target you and cannot
make opportunity attacks against
you.
In addition, until the spell
ends, you can use a bonus
action on each of your
turns to force one
creature within 10 feet
of you to roll a Wisdom
saving throw. It has
advantage on the
saving throw if you
do not currently
have a creature marked,
and it automatically succeeds if it is a construct or
undead. On a failure, a creature takes 1d6 psychic
damage and becomes frightened of you until the
end of your next turn.

of your next turn.
You can use your spellcasting ability instead of
Strength or Dexterity for the attack and damage
rolls of melee attacks using this weapon, and it
inflicts force damage instead of the normal damage
for a weapon of that type.
As part of the action of casting this spell, you can
make one melee attack with the weapon against a
creature within 5 feet of you. If you do so, for that
first attack only, the weapon inflicts an extra 1d4
force damage. After that, you attack with the
weapon normally.
Though it is no more delicate than a common
version of the weapon you have created, your minor
telekinetic weapon manifests as a semi-transparent
solid the same color as your eyes. This weapon has
the simplest possible geometric shape it can have
while still functioning as the chosen type of
weapon, and creatures who see it know it is a
magical effect you have created. At the end of the
spell's duration, the weapon dissipates harmlessly.
This spell's damage increases when you reach
higher levels. At 5th level, the extra force damage
you inflict when you make an attack with the
weapon as part of the action of casting this spell
increases by 1d4. This damage roll increases by an
additional 1d4 at 11th level and 17th level.

Select a non-humanoid target that you can see
within range. The target must make a Wisdom
saving throw. If it fails the save, the target is
charmed and under your mental control (as if under
the effects of the dominate monster spell).
Unlike the dominate monster spell, this effect
doesn’t grant the monster a saving throw whenever
it takes damage. However, if you give the creature
an order that is suicidal, self-destructive, or against
its very nature (such as ordering a celestial to
murder innocents), it can make another saving
throw with disadvantage to resist the order. If the
creature makes its saving throw, though it doesn’t
obey that particular order, it is still your thrall.
However, all future saving throws made to resist
that order are made with advantage.

“Of all the multiverse’s practitioners of the Art,
even among the ranks of the archmages, few
can match Mordenkainen in his meticulous
creativity when researching spells, his breadth

“I have considered Mordenkainen a friend
for centuries. For a time, we enjoyed
regular meetings, joined by a third wizard
from a distant plane (a black-robed elf
who was mentored by the most
terrifyingly ambitious archmage even I
ever heard of), and I eagerly looked
forward to our exchanges of arcane

saving throw, a creature takes half damage.
All creatures within 10 feet of you when the blast
occurs take force damage equal to 8 × the number
of unexpended spell slots you had when you cast

away from you take force damage equal to 6 × the

You summon an avalanche of snow out of a rift in

sphere centered on that point is covered in snow
and becomes difficult terrain for 1 hour. In addition,
all creatures within a 40-foot radius sphere centered
on the sam epoint must make a Dexterity saving
throw. The effects of the saving throw depend on a
creature's distance from the center of the effect.
A creature within a 20-foot radius sphere from

10d12 cold damage and 10d12 bludgeoning damage,

but within 40 feet of its center, who fails its saving
throw takes 5d12 cold and 5d12 bludgeoning
damage, is pushed 20 feet away from the center
point, and falls prone. On a successful saving throw,
the creature takes half as much damage and is
pushed only 10 feet from the center point. Any
creature that fails its saving throw by 5 or more is
also buried in the snow.
A creature buried in the snow is restrained, and it
is surrounded by snow that provides full cover. On
its turn, a buried creature can use its action to make
a Strength check against your spell save DC. On a
success, it frees itself. Other creatures within 5-feet
of a buried creature can attemt to dig it out, but
freeing one buried creature requires one or more
others to use a total of ten actions digging. This can
be one creature using ten actions, five creatures
using two actions each, or some other combination
that equals a total of ten actions, over however
many rounds this requires.
Structures and inanimate objects in the area
suffer the same effects as creatures, which often
causes small trees to be uprooted and structures to
collapse. Even after the snow melts, rubble and
other detritus are left behind. All flames in the area
are extinguished, whether they are magical or not.

You show a target how important their life is to the
multiverse. It must make a Wisdom saving throw or
be stunned and fall prone. At the end of your next it
is no longer stunned, but it is still prone. At the
start of its next turn your target must make a

as far away as possible from any creatures near it. A
creature that fails the save will only fight if forced to
defend itself. It can repeat the Wisdom saving

Name: Pain
Level: 4
School: Enchantment
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 120 feet
Components: V, S, M (a live leech)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Description:
This spell strikes creatures with wracking pains and
agony, even if they are unliving. Roll 12d8, and total
the dice. The number rolled is the number of hit
points of creatures this spell can affect. Creatures
within 20 feet of a point you choose within range
are affected in ascending order of their current hit
points (ignoring unconscious creatures and
constructs, who are not affected by this spell).
Subtract each creature's hit points from the total
before moving on to the creature with the next
lowest hit points. A creature's hit points must be
equal to or less than the remaining total for that
creature to be affected.
Starting with the creature that has the lowest
current hit points, each creature affected by this
spell has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability
checks until the spell ends. Each creature can
attempt to resist, but only at the risk of making its
agony even worse. Each creature affected by the
spell can choose whether to make a Constitution
saving throw to try to resist the spell’s effect at the
end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself
with a success. However, if the creature fails the
saving throw, it takes 3d6 psychic damage. A
creature that fails this saving throw four times in a
row is incapacitated with pain, in addition to the
spell's other effects.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 5th level or higher, roll an additional
2d8 for each slot level above 4th.
“Though negotiation is preferable, for some creatures pain is a
much more effective and expedient form of motivation.”

Name: Pocket Cave
Level: 5
School: Conjuration
Casting Time: 1 minute
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M (a black piece of cloth
Duration: 8 hours
Description:
shaped like an arched doorway)
You conjure an extradimensional cave that has a
single entrance on the plane from which the spell
was cast. You can only cast this spell on a surface
made of rock or some form of earth within range.
The entry point looks like a dark cave entrance that
is 5 feet wide and 10 feet high. Only those you
designate can enter the cave, and all other creatures
and objects are barred from passing through. Spells
and other magical effects can’t extend through the
entry portal or be cast through it. The entry portal is
shut and made invisible behind you when you
enter. You can open it again from your side at will.
You can choose the shape of the cave inside. You
can form it into a hemispherical dome or a sphere
with a radius of up to 30 feet. It takes the form of a
dark, wet cavern. This area contains enough oxygen
to sustain as many creatures as can fit in the area
for the duration of the spell. Edible fungus grows
along the walls, and condensation drips down one
wall into a pool of fresh, clean water that never
seems to run dry. External conditions such as
weather do not affect the pleasant atmosphere of
the cave, and nothing except the designated
creatures can pass through the portal in either
direction. Until the spell ends, you can command
the interior to become dimly lit or dark.
At the end of the spell’s duration, all within the
pocket cave return to the spot where they entered
or else to the nearest open space, if that spot is
occupied.
“Most sources state that the orc god
Gruumsh was the first to grant his
clerics this spell, which seems oddly
inventive for the one-eyed one. However,
some sages believe that another orc
pantheon deity granted it first, and
Gruumsh’s shamans demanded credit be
given to their god instead. That seems
much more plausible.”

Pool of Deeds
4th-level divination (ritual)
You enchant a body of water of any size and name a
creature. This can be a living or dead individual.
The creature you name, or their corpse, does not
have to be physically present. The most important
events of that creature’s life will play out in the
water. The whole event will take about an hour.
You can also choose to view a specific story from
the target’s life. You must have general knowledge
of the story, but you don’t need to know specifics. If
you name a creature that does not want to have its
life events displayed, it can make a Charisma saving
throw to resist the spell. On a success, the pool
shows a series of random images.
“Another mysterious spell. The events it
depicts always seem to be momentous, but how
it determines which events matter enough to be
shown is unclear. This spell’s judgement
doesn’t seem to parallel that of the caster or the
target.”

Premonitory Vision
4th-level divination (ritual)
finish a short or long rest
You perceive a series of images that show you future
events. You ask a single question concerning a
specific goal, event, or activity to occur within seven
days. The DM offers a truthful reply. The reply
might be a short phrase, an explanation of your own
emotional reaction, or a description of a single
image you saw.
The spell doesn’t consider any possible
circumstances that might change the outcome, such
as the casting of additional spells, or the loss or gain
of a companion.
After you cast this spell, unless you treat yourself
with a special calming tincture that uses 25 gold
pieces worth of ingredients, you have disadvantage
on Wisdom, Dexterity, and Intelligence checks, and
on Constitution saving throws to maintain
concentration for 10 minutes.
If you cast the spell two or more times before
finishing your next long rest, you receive
increasingly confusing visions that muddle your
mind. For each casting after the first, the duration
of the negative effects for not imbibing a calming
tincture increase by an additional (cumulative) 10
minutes, and there is a cumulative 25* chance that
the information you perceive is random and
possibly unrelated to the question you asked. The
DM makes this roll in secret.

While casting this spell, you designate one creature

to activate the wormhole. The caller may discharge
the spell by repeating the command word and
creating the wormhole. Communication and travel
are possible through the wormhole, which has
infinite range and can cross dimensional
boundaries.
Once the caller says the command word, the
caster hears a voice alerting that someone is calling.
The door knocker raises five feet off the ground. By
grasping the door knocker, the caster can open a
portal to the caller. The caster and the caller can
speak through the portal and the caster can look
around without stepping through. Spells can be cast
through the wormhole. The caster can also go
through the wormhole and join the caller. The
caster may collapse the wormhole at will. However,
the wormhole will only last 1 minute per spellcaster

or not. If the wormhole remains open, anyone can

Probe Thoughts
6th-level divination (ritual)
Your target must make a Wisdom saving throw. If it
fails, its mind opens itself to you. You gain access to
all of its memories and knowledge, even things the
target has buried deep in its subconscious. You may
learn the answer to one question per round. Your
question and the answer are conveyed
telepathically, and you do not need to speak the
same language. Creatures with an Intelligence less
than 3 may only answer in mental pictures.
The target is not aware of the probe unless you
wish it to be. If the target resists the probe
successfully, they know that someone has tried to
cast a spell on them, but not what the spell was nor
who cast it.

Description:
Your force of will teleports an object a short
distance away. You teleport one object you are
holding to an unoccupied space within range.
Alternatively, you can teleport the object to a
willing creature within range.
You can either cause the object to land at the
creature’s feet, or you can give the creature the
option to grasp it with a free hand, which requires
the creature to make a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check
with a DC of 11. If the creature succeeds, it is
instantly holding the object. If the check fails, the
object falls to its feet.
This cantrip can only teleport objects that weigh
25 pounds or less. In addition, it cannot affect
objects that you are not already holding when you
cast the spell.
Projected Magnification
2nd-level illusion (ritual)
Choose a 5 foot square within the range. That
square is recreated within 10 feet of you. The image
is purely visual, with no sound of smell. The image
is an obvious illusion, and creatures can see through
it. The spell creates a snapshot of the 5 foot area you
chose when you cast the spell, but nothing in the
area moves or changes. The area appears exactly as
it does at the time of the spell, and you do gain any
special means of vision. For instance, if the area is
covered in darkness, either natural or magical, then
so is the snapshot.

Description:
This spell functions the same as silent image, except
that the image remains invisible until triggered. You
decide what triggers the image when you cast the
spell, but the trigger must be audible, tactile,
olfactory, or visual. The most typical triggers
include touching an object that had the spell cast
upon it, stepping within 10 feet of the point where
the spell was cast, or speaking a certain phrase.
Once triggered, the image appears at the point
where you cast the spell and lasts for 10 minutes,
after which time the spell ends. You can pre-
program the image to move around once activated,
in a similar manner to silent image.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using

You cast your mind's eye forward a split second,
predicting the best moment for a telling blow. As
part of the action used to cast this spell, you must
make a melee weapon attack against a creature
within range, otherwise the spell fails. You can use
your spellcasting ability instead of Strength for the
attack and damage bonus for this attack. If the
attack hits, it inflicts an additional 2d6 damage of
the weapon’s type, and the next attack roll made
against the target before the end of your next turn is
made with advantage.

“The name of the moon elf swordmage and
bladesinger Quivaelyn Mondior is often left off
these spells, and some indicate that he is not
their true inventor, but rather merely recreated
effects that had been practiced in old Myth
Drannor. Quivaelyn is also well-known for
rediscovering lost elven traditions of battle
magic not long before the Time of Troubles
and for his later service as one of the most
trusted armathors (bodyguards) of Lady
Ilsevele Miritar, the seventh Coronal of the
rebuilt realm of Cormanthyr. He is known to
have survived the new Myth Drannor’s fall,
entering the service of a Cormyrean noble
family for a time, but seems to vanish from
history a few years after.
“In any case, his devoted scholarship has
preserved many swordmage spells that would
otherwise have been lost.”
—Laeral Silverhand
“Rumors say that Quivaelyn designed this
spell to emulate the ki-based movement
powers of his close ally, the monk Ang Si
Zhao of T’u Lung.
“Other rumors, from his late career,
say he fell in love with a human woman
and settled down to raise a family, either
in the rebuilt port of Ylraphon or
somewhere on the Sword Coast. “

“I believe this spell to be a recent creation,
crafted by Ariella Kulmina, a Windsoul genasi
swordmage from Airspur, though I know
Elminster’s scholarly opinion differs. He
concludes that Ariella discovered it in the
spellbook of the moon elf Josidiah Starym, a
famed bladesinger of old Myth Drannor.
“Wherever it originated, it is now a favorite
of those who combine blade and spell in battle,
in frequent use by spellcasting warriors of both
elven and genasi ancestry, as well as among the
githyanki gish.”
—Laeral Silverhand
“If this is not the spell Starym was
researching with an apprentice when he

coincidence Kulmina researched a nearly
identical dweomer of her own over a
millennium later.”

=== SPELL START ===
Name: Read Moods
Level: 1
School: Divination
Casting Time: 10 minutes
Range: Touch (1 object)
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour
Description:
Choose up to six creatures you can see within range.
Those creatures must make a Wisdom saving throw.
If they succeed the spell has no effect on that
creature. If they fail, the DM must provide you with
a one-word summary of the emotional state of each
creature, such as "happy," "confused," "afraid," or
"violent." You receive no information from this spell
about creatures that are not living (such as
constructs or undead) or from creatures which are
immune to psychic damage.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the number of
creatures whose mood you can read with this spell
is increased by two for each slot level above 1st.
“The practical value of knowing a possible
oppoenent’s emotional state cannot be
overestimated, especially when entering into
delicate negotiations or investigating the
commission of a crime. Certain casters may not
wish to spend their energies on it, but I can
attest that early use of read moods has oft saved
me the casting of many a meteor swarm spell
later on.”
—Laeral Silverhand
Read Object
6th-level divination (ritual)
You can concentrate on an object you are touching,
reading psychic impressions left on it by recent
events. At the end of the time you spend casting
this spell, you learn of any events within the past 24
hours that occurred within 30 feet of the object. You
see, hear, and smell those events from the object’s
point of view, as if you had been there at the time.
You also see a mental image of the last creature
that handled the object, also from the object’s
perspective, no matter how long ago the object was
last held. The only information you receive about
the creature is its appearance at that time
(including a sense of its size), whether it was alone
(although you can’t see any other creatures that
might have been there), and a one or two-word
description from the DM describing that creature’s
emotional state the last time it touched the object
(such as “Enraged”, “Extremely Agitated”, “Relaxed”,
“Satisfied”, “Utterly Emotionless”, etc.). If the
creature was not capable of emotion, or if its mental
state was too alien for you to understand, the DM
will tell you that instead.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 7th level or higher, if the object has
been handled by multiple creatures within the last
week, you get the same information about each
creature who handled it during that time the same
way you would normally receive about the last
creature who handled it.

existence. Similarly, any creatures caught within the

pulled into the maelstrom and transported. All
objects and creatures sucked into the maelstrom are
transported to the same plane of existence.
The maelstrom has a secondary windstorm effect
that extends 40 feet from the center of the sphere.
All unattended objects weighing 50 pounds or less
in the extended area are pulled 20 feet closer toward
the maelstrom’s center, and then sucked into the
rift and transported. A creature within the extended
area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a
failure, it is pulled 20 feet closer to the center of the
sphere. Any creature pulled into the sphere must

gaze, you momentarily project an
impulse into your enemy's
mind, channeling its hostility towards you into a
sudden reflexive attack against another of your foes.
Choose one humanoid creature you can see within
range that can also see and hear you. The target
must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become
charmed by you until the start of its next turn. A
creature has advantage on this saving throw if it is
not currently in combat, or if it has witnessed
another creature fail its saving throw against your
casting of this spell within the past minute.
When you charm a target with this spell, any
other creatures who can see or hear you know you
have magically influenced the target, and you can
immediately choose one of two effects:
 You can force the charmed target to walk up to
15 feet, and you choose its movement. It will not
move into difficult terrain or through the spaces
of other creatures, and its movement only
provokes opportunity attacks from other
creatures hostile to you. After the creature
moves, the spell ends.
 You can make a melee spell attack against
another creature within 5 feet of the charmed
target. The charmed target delivers this melee
spell attack, as if it had cast the spell. On a hit,
the attack inflicts 1d6 psychic damage. Whether
the attack hits or misses, the spell ends.
When the spell ends, the creature realizes that
you used magic to control it and becomes hostile
toward you. It likely seeks to attack you or your
allies, but will not do so if doing so would be
disadvantageous for it or its friends. The creature
might also seek retribution in other ways (at the
DM’s discretion), depending on the situation.
The spell's damage increases by 1d6 when you
reach 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level
(4d6).
“Arguably the most powerful cantrip in battle. Not only
excellent for quickly establishing tactical controil, but also
invaluable for the fear and uncertainty it sows in the enemy’s
ranks.”
—Mordenkainen
“On this point, I find myself in agreement
with the pitiful Mordenkainen. A rare
occasion, that.
“Teaching this cantrip to even the most
ignorant of apprentices makes them much
more useful when they fight in the
company of your other minions.”

Duration: 1 hour
Description:
You channel your hunger for new experiences into a
special state of mental focus. For the duration,
whenever you attack with a weapon you have not
attacked with since the last time you rolled
initiative, you roll 1d6 and add the result to the
attack roll. You gain the same bonus when you cast
a spell requiring an attack roll that you have not
cast since the last time you rolled initiative.
“This spell was first researched in the outer-
planar city of Sigil, by members of a faction
known as the Society of Sensation. Not all
casters are as eager for new experiences as the
creators of this spell, especially after a thousand
years or more of life, but the magic is potent
enough that it always achieves its practical
effect, regardless of the user’s state of mind.”

Sensory Caress
1st-level divination (ritual)
In a moment of quiet reflection, you touch a
creature and can take its pain or anguish onto
yourself, temporarily suppressing one condition
afflicting it. The condition can be blinded,
deafened, paralyzed, or poisoned. When you
suppress the condition, the creature is no longer
afflicted with it, but you immediately suffer the
same condition yourself for duration, even if you
would normally be immune to it. At the end of your
next turn, you can make a Constitution saving
throw against your own spellcasting DC. If you
succeed, the condition ends early for you, but it
remains suppressed for the original creature until
the spell ends. If you fail, you can make the saving
throw again at the end of each of your turns until
you end the condition early or the spell ends.
When this spell ends, any suppressed effect
resumes for the creature that originally suffered it,
provided that its duration has not expired in the
meantime.

Description:
You touch a quiver containing arrows or bolts.
When a target is hit by a ranged weapon attack
using a piece of ammunition drawn from the quiver,
the target takes an extra 2d6 poison damage. Even if
the attack misses, the target takes 1d6 poison
damage. The spell’s magic ends on the piece of
ammunition when it hits or misses, and the spell
ends when ten pieces of ammunition have been
drawn from the quiver.
After each attack, whether it hits or misses, the
used piece of ammunition falls into an unoccupied
space closest to the target, where it transforms into
a giant poisonous snake under the control of the
creature who attacked with the ammunition.
Giant poisonous snakes created by this spell
are friendly to you and your companions. They act
on the initiative of the creature who attacked with
the ammunition, immediately after that creature’s
turn ends, but act on their own. The snakes obey
any verbal commands issued by the creature
controlling them (no action required by you). If that
creature doesn't issue any commands, the snakes
continue to attack the target of the ranged attack
(even if the target has dropped to 0 hit points), but
otherwise take no actions beyond defending
themselves.
Each snake changes back into a piece of
ammunition when it drops to 0 hit points or when
the spell ends.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the number of
pieces of ammunition you can affect increases by
two for each slot level above 4th.

“This spell is often associated with the cleric Serten, a close
friend of Tenser who died in battle some years ago. In fact, a
legendary archmage, also called Serten, created the spell long
before the famed cleric was born. Adding to the confusion was
the fact that the cleric Serten possessed a magic ring which
granted him the benefits of this spell.
“Tenser spent years blaming me for the cleric’s death.
Whether he ever forgave me or saw sense, I don’t know, but I
bear no responsibility for the man’s fate. The truth is, the cleric
Serten was a fool—a brave, kindly, helpful fool, but a fool
nonetheless—and he was undone by his own reckless yearning
for adventure.”
—Mordenkainen
Servant Army
5th-level conjuration (ritual)
which many lengths of knotted thread are attached)
You create a number of invisible, mindless,
shapeless forces that perform simple tasks at your
command. Roll 3d4 to determine how many
servants you create. Each servant obeys any verbal
commands that you issue (no action required by
you). However, if you don't issue any commands, a
servant does nothing as it awaits your next
command.
Once you give a command, each servant performs
its task to the best of its ability until its task is
completed. It then waits for your next command.
Your servants can run and fetch things, open
unstuck doors, and hold chairs as well as clean and
mend. A servant can also be used for common
laborious tasks, if you carefully direct it. The
servants are no better or faster at tasks than a basic
or unskilled commoner would be.
The servants can serve food or wine at a banquet,
help dig earthworks, row a ship, act as porters, fold
clothes, or assist in a farmer’s fields. Each servant
can perform only one activity at a time, but it
repeats the same activity continuously if told to do
so. This allows you to command one servant to
perform a repetitive task and then turn your
attention elsewhere if you remain within range.
Servants can open only normal doors, drawers, lids,
and so forth. They have an effective Strength score
of 2 (so they can carry 30 pounds, and push, drag, or
lift 60 pounds). They can trigger traps and such, but
they can exert only 60 pounds of force, and that is
not enough to activate certain pressure plates and
other devices. A servant’s speed is 15 feet.
The servants cannot attack in any way, and are
never allowed to make an attack roll. The servants
have an Armor Class of 10 and 6 hit points. The
servants cannot be killed, but they dissipate after
taking 6 points of damage. (They do not make
saving throws). If you attempt to send a servant
beyond the spell’s range (measured from your
current position), that servant ceases to exist.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 6th level or higher, you create 1d4
additional servants for every slot level above 5th.
When you cast it using a spell slot of 7th level or
higher, the spell’s duration increases to 8 hours.
“On the eve of a naval battle, a wu-jen conjurer
of Koryo once inflicted great fear and chaos
upon a Kozakuran port with the servant army
spell. Making herself unseen with other tricks,
she would stand on the docks, magically
distract sailors on watch, have the invisible
servants she’d conjured board a ship and sail it
fifty feet or so from shore, then move to
another berth and repeat the same trick.
“Mages of Kara-Tur invented this spell, and
their region’s history records many creative
uses of it. The subtlety I often find so lacking in
the spellcasters of Faerûn seems to be much less
rare in the nations of that eastern continent.”

Shifting Paths
8th-level illusion (ritual)
This spell hides a path or road that you choose,
while also creating an illusory path that starts at a
point you choose within range. The illusory path
continues in a direction you choose for up to a
number of miles equal to 2 × your spellcasting
ability modifier. This illusory path avoids obstacles,
and does not provide bridges, stairs, ladders, ramps,
or other methods to travel through impassable
terrain. The path will not cross cliffs or rivers more
than four feet deep.
A creature following the original path must make
a Wisdom saving throw when it comes to the start
of the illusory path. On a failed save, the creature
follows the illusory path as if it were the real one. If
the path moves through difficult terrain, the
creature believes the path slopes and twists to
justify its reduction in speed.
On a successful save, the creature sees both
paths, but the illusory path appears shadowy.

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour
Description:
from any destroyed undead creature)
You shroud yourself in necrotic energy, temporarily
gaining the traits of undeath. Your appearance does
not change except for a very slight pallor, but your
creature type changes to undead for the duration of
the spell.
Nonintelligent undead creatures perceive you as
one of their kind, ignoring you. Intelligent undead
do not immediately recognize you as alive, but may
question whether you are undead. Any ability check
made to determine that you are not truly undead is
made with disadvantage, and you have advantage
on all Charisma checks to convince others of your
undead nature.
If an undead creature does target you directly
with an attack or a harmful spell, that creature must
make a Wisdom saving throw (an undead needn't
make the save when it includes you in an area
effect, such as the explosion or fireball). On a failed
saving throw, the creature must choose a new target
or forfeit targeting someone else, potentially
wasting the attack or spell. A creature automatically
succeeds on this saving throw if it has made a
successful saving throw against this effect within
the last 24 hours or it has seen you target an undead
creature with an attack or other harmful effect
within the last 24 hours.
Because you are undead, if a spell or other effect
states that it does not affect undead, then it does
not affect you for the spell’s duration. Conversely,
effects that do affect undead (such as the Turn
Undead class feature) affect you as such.

Three fiery orbs appear and hover above you for the
duration. As part of the action used to cast the spell,
you can launch all the motes at targets you can see
within range. However, a target can attempt a
Dexterity saving throw to avoid the fiery motes. On
a failed save, the target takes 2d6 fire damage, and
the mote detonates. The target and each creature
within 10-feet of the burst must make a Dexterity
saving throw. On a failed save a creature takes 5d6
fire damage, or half as much on a successful one.
Targets within 45 feet of the caster have
disadvantage on the initial saving throw.
If a target makes the initial Dexterity saving
throw, the mote misses and flies to the extent of the
spell’s range and then bursts with the same effects
described above. The caster can fire all the motes
the first round or use an action to fire the remaining
motes before the duration expires.

You let out a thunderous shout that blasts outward
from you in a 30-foot cone. A creature caught in the
blast must succeed on a Constitution saving throw
or take 4d6 thunder damage and be deafened until
the end of its next turn. On a successful save, the
creature takes half the damage and isn’t deafened.
A creature made of inorganic material such as
stone, crystal, or metal has disadvantage on this
saving throw. A nonmagical object that isn't being
worn or carried also takes the damage if it's in the
spell's area. The sound of the shout can be heard up
to 500 feet away (or farther with a successful
Wisdom (Perception) check as determined by your
DM).
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using

only be opened if broken, or with knock or dispel
magic. However, if the object is forced open by any
means (physical or magical), the sigil explodes in
30-foot radius for 10d4 force damage. A successful
Dexterity saving throw halves the damage.

You burn prophetic herbs, and the billowing smoke
grants visions of future danger, giving one creature
you touch preternatural foresight in battle. The next
time the creature makes a Dexterity check for
initiative before the spell ends, it treats any roll of 9
or lower on the d20 as a 10. In addition, for the
duration, when the target fails a Wisdom check, if
that failure would cause it to be surprised, it can
reroll that ability check. It must use the second roll.
The spell ends early on a target whenever that
creature makes an ability check for initiative.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can touch and
affect one extra creature for every two spell levels
above 1st.
“When a wizard knows both the
nerveskitter and
sign of

You use several pieces of ancient amber to create a
matrix that contains spells you cast, frozen in time
until you need them. While casting this spell you
cast up to three spells of 1st through 3rd level, and
you choose a command word. When the command
word is spoken, all three spells take effect
immediately, in the order they were cast, as if you
had just cast all three of them in the same turn, and
the spell ends. At the time they are unleashed, you
make all decisions for each of these spells (targets,
area, etc.) that you would normally make as the
caster. You may only have one Simbul’s spell
sequencer active at a time.
Only spells with a casting time of 1 action or 1
bonus action can be cast into your spell sequencer.
When you create the sequencer, you reduce your
maximum Hit Dice by a number equal to the total
combined levels of the spell slots used to cast the
spells you place in it. Your maximum number of Hit
Dice does not return to normal until the spell ends.
If the duration expires and you did not speak the
command word, or if you choose to dismiss the
spell, the spell ends, and the other spells you cast
into your sequencer are lost.

the arrow or bolt hits, and the creature struck is the
creature type named during the spell casting, the
creature must make a Constitution saving throw. A

succeeds. On a failure, it does. On a success, the
arrow deals an extra 8d6 necrotic damage. This
extra damage ignores resistance and immunity.
Sleep of Horror
3rd-level necromancy (ritual)
A target you choose within range must make an
Intelligence saving throw. If it fails the save, its next
sleep is wracked with terrifying nightmares, and

the Intelligence saving throw again. If it fails, it
gains no benefit from the long rest. If it succeeds,
the spell ends. The spell continues until the target
makes its Intelligence saving throw, or until it dies.

over liquid surfaces.
 If you move at least 20 feet straight toward a
creature and then hit it with a melee weapon
attack on the same turn, that attack inflicts an
additional 1d4 damage.
At the end of the turn, the benefits fade entirely
until you spend another speed point. If these
benefits end while you are still on a vertical surface,
or anywhere else where you would normally fall or
sink, you immediately fall or begin to sink unless
you have some other means to remain there.
This spell ends when its duration expires, when
you cast this spell again, or when you have spent all
your speed points. When the spell ends, any unspent
speed points are lost.
At Higher Levels. If you cast this spell with a
spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the extra damage
you inflict with melee weapon attacks against
opponents when you move 20 feet increases by 1d4
for each slot level above 1st. In addition, if you cast
this spell with a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you
gain one additional speed point for every two slot
levels above 1st.

disintegrated creature)
You conjure a 5-foot diameter featureless black
sphere of nothingness that disintegrates almost
anything it touches. The sphere appears in an
unoccupied space of your choice within range and
lasts for the duration.
Any creature that ends its turn within 5 feet of
the sphere must make a Dexterity saving throw. The
target takes 12d6 + 60 force damage on a failed save,
or half as much on a success. If this damage reduces
the target to 0 hit points, it is disintegrated, as if by
the disintegrate spell. A disintegrated creature and
everything it is wearing and carrying, except magic
items, are reduced to a pile of fine gray dust. The
creature can be restored to life only by means of a
true resurrection or a wish spell.
As an action, you can move the sphere up to 30
feet. When you move the sphere, it flies, and you
can move it any direction you wish. If you ram the
sphere into a creature, that creature must make the
saving throw against the sphere’s damage. If you
ram the sphere into a Medium or smaller object
that is not being held or carried, that object is
disintegrated. If you ram this sphere into a Huge or
larger object, it disintegrates the 5-foot cube area of
that object it strikes. If you ram the sphere into a
creation of magical force (such as the wall created
by a wall of force spell), it has the same effect on
that magical force that it would have on an object of
the same size. Magic items are not affected by this
spell.
Whenever you ram the sphere into a creature or
object, it uses up 10 feet of movement for every 5
feet it moves through the space occupied by that
creature or object. No object or creature can be
affected by the sphere more than once in the same
turn.

“Geran Hulmaster, one of the rare humans
directly trained in the Art of the swordmage by
the elves of the Coronal Guard, was a
noteworthy user of this spell. He learned it in
service to the Coronal of Myth Drannor, but
employed it most famously in large scale battles
defending the small city of Hulburg. His later
career was inseparably intertwined with the
recent history of that Moonsea port, which his
family had ruled before their exile.”

Make a ranged spell attack against a creature within
range. If the attack hits, the creature takes 1d4
lightning damage and it is charged with crackling
arcane energy until the spell ends. If the target
makes an attack roll before the end of its next turn,
it takes force damage equal to your spellcasting
ability modifier. If the attack hits, the damage the
attack inflicts is reduced by an amount equal to the
force damage dealt by this spell. Either way, the
spell ends after the attack is resolved.
At 5th level, the lightning damage from the
ranged spell attack increases by 1d4, and the force
damage dealt to a target who attacks equals 1d4 +
your spellcasting ability modifier. Both damages
increase by 1d4 at 11th and 17th level.
”Two artificers—both gnomes, one hailing from the city of
Korranberg on the world of Eberron, the other from the island
of Lantan off the Sword Coast of Abeir-Toril, neither aware
of the other’s existence—each claim to be the inventors of this
cantrip.
“One might be lying, or it could be a rare case of parallel
invention, but my own suspicion is that each is taking credit for
a spell that came to their world from a third, as yet unknown
source.”

you steal increases by 5 feet as well when you reach
5th level (15 feet), 11th level (20 feet), and 17th level
(25 feet).
“Some consider spells relating to certain
powerful, mysterious forces such as time,
gravity, true names, momentum, and the
underlying energies contained within all
matter—to be the most difficult to master.
Different sages across the Multiverse know
these varied fields of spellcasting by many
names—chronomancy, Cataclysm magic,
dunamancy, chaos magic, velocimancy,
allomancy, cryptomancy, or simply the magic
of Forces— but there are few worlds in which
they are well-understood.
“Then, of course, there are spells like steal
speed, which manipulate these phenomena in
an extraordinarily sophisticated way, and yet
do so by means that can be taught to the
beginning apprentice. I attribute the research
and creation of such spells to a level of genius
that no one can be taught—like being a musical
prodigy, it is a miraculous talent one must be
born with.”
—Laeral Silverhand
“On the point of such ‘talent’ only being innate, I must
respectfully disagree with the lady. Should we give up the study
of wizardry and leave the most sophisticated forms of magic to
mere
sorcerers, then? I think not.”

to stand upon, which is used as a teleportation pad.
Before the spell is cast, each platform must be
prepared by crushing 2,000 gold pieces worth of
gemstones and performing a 10-minute ritual.
To complete the spell, you must perform another
10-minute ritual using the remaining 1,000 gold

to travel back and forth between the teleportation
pads. When the command word is spoken, one
person may be transported with up to 100 pounds of
gear.
Teleportation using this spell is infallible and
cannot be blocked by magical barriers or wards

When casting this spell, you point in a direction and

The vortex whirls around any creature caught in
its area, blasting it with fist-sized balls of force, and
jolting it with small lightning strikes. The creature
takes 5d4 bludgeoning damage from the wind
buffets, and 2d4 lightning damage. A successful
Dexterity saving throw halves the bludgeoning
damage, but not the lightning damage.
In addition, a spellcaster caught in the cone must
make a successful Constitution saving throw when
casting a spell with somatic components. Though it
is against your normal spellcasting DC, this saving
throw is the equivalent of a roll to maintain
concentration on a spell, and special benefits or
other effects the creatures has on such Constitution

=== SPELL START ===
Name: Storm of Elemental Fury
Level: 7

Range: 300 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: 4 rounds
Description:
A furious storm erupts in a 40-foot radius, 100-foot-
high cylinder centered on a point you choose within
range. When you cast this spell, and again at the
beginning of each of your turns until the spell ends,
the storm produces one of the following effects,
starting with the first, and then progressing down
the list.
1st turn. The storm buffets the area with a raging
windstorm. No creature within the area can make
ranged attacks or be the target of a ranged attack. A
Small or smaller creature caught in the storm’s area
must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed
save, the creature is swept up, thrown 2d6 × 10 feet
in a random direction, and takes 1d6 bludgeoning
damage per ten feet thrown. A Medium creature
must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be
knocked prone. A Large or larger creature must
succeed on a Strength saving throw or its speed
drops to 0.
A Large flying creature that fails its saving throw
is blown 1d6 × 5 feet in a random direction, Medium
f lying creatures are blown 1d6 × 10 feet, and Small
flying creatures are blown 2d6 × 10 feet away.
For the spell's duration, any creature must make a
Constitution saving throw the first time it tries to
cast a spell inside the area. If it fails, it cannot cast
spells within the area until the spell ends. A
creature that failed its saving throw can make
another Constitution saving throw at the beginning
of each of its turns. If it succeeds, it can cast spells
normally again.
2nd turn. Rocks fall from the sky, pummelling
creatures caught in the storm’s area. Each creature
caught in the area takes 5d6 bludgeoning damage
(no save).
3rd turn. Heavy rain pours into the area,
automatically extinguishing unprotected flames,
and extinguishing protected flames 50% of the time.
Visibility within the area is reduced to 5 feet, and
the entire area of the spell becomes difficult terrain.
4th turn. Gouts of flame rain down from the sky
into the storm’s area. Any creature caught within
the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a
failed save, a creature takes 14d6 fire damage, or
half as much if successful.
“The Kingdom of Aundair’s First Warlord and
Royal Minister of Magic, Adal ir'Wynarn, is
desperate to acquire a cataclysmic spell of
just this type. He yearns to rain down death
upon the forces of Thrane which occupy
aundair’s lost capital city, Thaliost.”
“Providing this spell would purchase great
influence over Adal, and through him over all
of the wizards of Aundair. The fact that
casting it requires a higher level of mastery
than he possesses would, of course, not be our
problem. If anything, a greater need for
arcane empowerment would only encourage
him to indebt himself to us more.”

shield that blocks acid, cold, fire, lightning, and
thunder damage. The shield attracts all elemental
discharges and neutralizes them, granting all
creatures within a 30-foot radius from its center
immunity to the listed damage types. However, the
shield's immunity is limited. If the shield reduces
damage a creature would take to 0, the spell ends if

barrier must succeed on a Strength saving throw;
otherwise it takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage from
the high winds, and it makes no progress. A
creature can make more than one attempt to cross
the barrier on its turn, but it receives one level of

finish a long rest to prepare spells or regain any
abilities that require a long rest) and whenever you
hold your breath, you can do so for five times as
long as normal. If you have at least 1 hit point
remaining in your self-healing pool, you have
advantage on saving throws against poison and
resistance to poison damage.
This spell ends when you finish a long rest, or

For the duration, you can turn another spell you
cast into healing energy. Instead of its normal
effect, the spell you cast is held until you touch
another creature before the duration expires; the
creature you touch regains 1d10 hit points per level
of the spell slot used to cast the triggering spell,
and then this spell ends.
For example, you could cast this spell, and while
you maintain concentration, you could cast mind
blank using an 8th-level spell slot, and before the
duration expires, you could touch a creature and
cause it to regain 8d10 hit points.
“This spell is often known as The Simbul’s
Synostodweomer, after its creator, the Simbul,
known as the Witch-Queen of Aglarond, my
dearly departed sister.
“At first, I was surprised that Elminster had not
made this note, but he may yet find the pain of
my sister’s passing too acute for such a
comment.
“Those familiar with my own history will no
doubt mark places in this grimoire where I too
have chosen to remain silent.
“Yet writing about this spell gives me joy, not
sorrow, in remembering my sister, who was the
greatest spellcaster of us all—arguably the
greatest who ever lived. So much of her
instinctive grasp of magic is displayed here, her
cleverness and efficiency, that casting it almost
feels like having her by my side once more.
“The decades since the Time of Troubles have
piled up loss upon loss upon loss, more than
any prior century I can remember. Even for the
most powerful, in our hearts we all remain
shackled by time’s cruelties.”

the creature possesses (such as one you have seen it

with this spell, the DM will inform you before you
use an action to cast the spell.

make a Constitution saving throw against the spell.

—Mordenkainen
Greetings, my patron,
In sending this uniquely fascinating grimoire via
caravel to Martira Bay (from whence I trust our
mutual associate has conveyed it to you, my patron), I
had not intended to include any notes of my own in
its already crowded pages. However, in perusing the
spells within, I came across this spell, which I had
only previously seen named as your creation.
However, as recorded here, its name does not
attribute my patron at all. Rather, it is entitled Vecna’s
final command, seemingly referencing the powerful
undead archmage who briefly ruled the domain of
Cavitius, prior to the conflagration that consumed
the (aptly named) cluster of Burning Peaks. I write,
for scholarship’s sake, to seek a clarification, given my
patron’s obvious direct knowledge of the matter.
In any case, I remain grateful for my patron’s faith
in my researches. Please expect my next larger volume
soon, detailing my travels in the Nocturnal Sea, as
well as narrating how I found this spellbook in the
Library of Neverwere Manor, on the isle of Liffe, an
ordeal which I was fortunate to survive.
Regards,
S—
I return this spellbook, having my own
existing copy, cleansed of the distracting
scribbles of lesser minds.
Have a care what notes you make in such
tomes, especially with mention of your patron’s
name. These writings reach more eyes than you
know. It is not a sort of recklessness to be
tolerated twice.
As for my spell named falsely, do not concern
yourself with the subject again. Nor with Vecna.
—A

these notes are interesting. Most
interesting. And very, very useful.”

Volcanic Eruption

Casting Time: 1 minute
Range: Self (360 ft. radius)
Components: V, S, M (a blade carved of obsidian,
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Description:
which shatters when the spell is cast)
You draw molten lava up through the ground,
which erupts to fill a sphere with a radius of 360
feet. The entire radius (even the sky above it and
the underground beneath it) immediately becomes
difficult terrain for the duration, and each creature
within that radius must make a Dexterity saving
throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d6
bludgeoning damage and 2d6 fire damage, and its
walking speed is reduced to 0 until the start of its
next turn. On a success, a creature takes half as
much damage and suffers no other effects. A
creature with full cover is still affected, but
automatically succeeds on its saving throw. You
take no damage from this spell, and automatically
succeed on saving throws against it.
Until the spell ends, if you can see some part of
the area of the spell, you can use a bonus action on
each of your turns to force each creature in the area
to make another saving throw or suffer the above
effects. You cannot cast this spell if you are more
than 360 feet away from an area of solid ground at
least 10 feet wide, but once it is cast, it lasts for the
duration, even if you are out of range.
When a creature wearing metal armor fails its
saving throw against this effect, it takes 2d6
additional fire damage, and has disadvantage on
attack rolls and ability checks until the start of its
next turn (as if affected by the heat metal spell).
Firenewts, earth-based elemental creatures (such
as gargoyles), or fire-based elemental creatures
(such as salamanders), do not take damage from
this spell. Instead, such a creature is healed,
regaining hit points equal to half the fire damage
inflicted. Only firenewts or creatures of the
elemental type can benefit from this effect.
The volcanic eruption damages objects in the area
and ignites flammable objects that aren't being
worn or carried. Structures in contact with the
ground in the area that take fire damage from this
effect take extra bludgeoning damage equal to half
the fire damage. If a structure drops to 0 hit points,
it collapses and potentially damages nearby
creatures, as described in the earthquake spell. The
eruption can be heard up to 500 miles away.
This spell leaves its entire area a blackened ruin
incapable of supporting plant life for a full year.
After that time, however, the ground is more fertile
than it was before the spell was cast.
“A powerful planar mage of my
acquaintance, the Crowngold, late of
Ylraphon, claims that this spell not only
works perfectly well on the bottom of
the sea, but also in elemental planes
where molten earth does not flow
beneath the surface, such as the Planes
of Air and Water. In fact, she found it
useful in such places to quickly expand a
small mote of earth into a substantial
island of solid rock. But first one must
find some earth to stand on!”

You invoke primal rage from within the earth itself,
sheathing yourself and your weapon in burning
magma and radiating wrath that scorches your foes.
Until the spell ends, you gain resistance to fire
damage and to non-magical bludgeoning, piercing,
and slashing damage, and your melee weapon
attacks inflict an additional 1d8 fire damage.
As a bonus action on each of your turns until the
spell ends, you can cause your volcanic rage to boil
over, forcing creatures within 5 feet of you to make
a Constitution saving throw. They take 2d6 fire
damage and 2d6 bludgeoning damage if they fail
the saving throw, or half as much on a success.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the fire damage
and bludgeoning damage you can inflict with a
bonus action increase by 1d6 for each slot level
above 6th.

=== SPELL START ===
Name: Vorpal Doom
Level: 9
School: Enchantment
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 5 feet
Components: V, M (a slashing weapon)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Description:
As part of the action used to cast this spell, you
must make a melee attack with a weapon against
one creature within the spell's range, otherwise the
spell fails. The weapon attack ignores resistance to
slashing damage. On a hit, the target suffers the
attack's normal effects and takes an extra 6d8
slashing damage from the hit. On a miss, the spell
ends.
If the initial attack hits, the weapon retains its
enchantment for the duration. Until the spell ends,
the weapon ignores resistance to slashing damage,
and once per turn, when you hit a creature with a
weapon attack, you can use a bonus action to cause
that creature to take an extra 6d8 slashing damage
from the hit.
In addition, while this spell is active (including
during the initial attack), if you attack a creature
that has at least one head with the weapon and roll
a 20 on the attack roll, you cut off one of the
creature's heads. The creature dies if it can't survive
without the lost head. A creature is immune to this
effect if it is immune to slashing damage, doesn't
have or need a head, has legendary actions, or the
DM decides that the creature is too big for its head
to be cut off with this weapon.

vortex appears or starts its turn there must make a
Dexterity saving throw or take 2d6 bludgeoning
damage from the battering winds.
Thereafter, the spellcaster can use an action to
call a lightning bolt from the vortex. The lightning
bolt streaks out up to 120 feet toward a target you
can see within range. The creature must make a
Dexterity saving throw or take 4d6 lightning
damage or have as much on a successful save.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using

Watchware
4th-level abjuration (ritual)
and powdered reagents worth at least 500 gp)
You create a mystical connection with a single
inanimate object you touch. When that object is
damaged, moved, or touched at any later time, you
are instantly aware of this fact. If another creature
physically touches the warded object, you receive a
mental image of the creature.
For purposes of divination spells (such as
scrying), you are considered to have first-hand
knowledge of the creature who triggered the effect
as if you had met.
This effect activates when the object is
disturbed for any reason, whether someone
touches it or pokes it with a pole, a cat
walks upon it, or an earthquake knocks it
over.
This spell ends as soon as the
effect is activated. Because
of its costly material
components, most
spellcasters
reserve
this
spell to protect valuable, out-of-the-way items.
This spell is considered a magical trap. It can be
detected with an Intelligence (Arcana or
Investigation) check made against your spellcasting
DC, but it can only be dispelled magically. You can
designate a password that allows another creature
to handle the object without sounding the mental
alarm if you choose.

You create an immobile curtain of snapping,

surface, and lasts for the duration. You choose to
make the barrier up to 60 feet long, 10 feet high, and
5 feet thick or a circle that has a 20-foot diameter

When the barrier appears, each creature within
its area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a
failed save a creature takes 8d6 piercing damage, or
half as much damage on a successful save (rounding
up).
The barrier is difficult terrain. Furthermore, the
first time a creature enters the barrier on a turn, or
ends its turn there, the creature must make a

on a failed save, or half as much damage on a
successful one (rounding up).
You can move through or remain within your
own whirl of fangs without taking damage.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 7th level of higher, both types of
damage increase by 1d6 for each slot level above the
6th.
“This spell was created either by the yuan-ti or
by their legendary progenitors, the ancient
sarrukh. It is popular among the most powerful
yuan-ti spellcasters, who ‘wear’ the effect as a
sort of immobile cloak when fighting
formidable foes.”

Description:
This spell creates a link between you and a nearby source
of arcane power, allowing you to draw on its strength to
bolster your spellcasting ability. When you cast a spell,
you can use a bonus action to draw on the link. Doing
so means you expend no spell slots to cast the spell, the
energy instead comes from the external power.
The more you draw on the link, the harder it is to
maintain. Each spell you cast in this manner decreases the
duration of the arcane parasite spell by 10 minutes per level
of the spell you cast using the link. For example, if you cast
a fireball spell using the link, you would not expend a spell
slot in the casting, but the duration of this spell would
decrease by 30 minutes. If you cast a spell using the link
and your remaining duration is equal to or less than the
spell’s level × 10 minutes, then this spell ends as soon as

When cast on a dead or undead body, as you were returns
that creature to the appearance it had in life while it was
healthy and uninjured. The target must have a physical
body; the spell fails if the target is normally noncorporeal.
If as you were is cast on a corpse, its effect is identical to
that of gentle repose, except that the corpse’s appearance is
restored to that of a healthy, uninjured (albeit dead) person.
If the target is an undead creature, it also is restored to
the appearance it had in life, even if it died from disease
or from severe wounds, or centuries ago. The target
looks, smells, and sounds (if it can speak) as it did in life.
Friends and family can tell something is wrong only with
a successful Wisdom (Insight) check against your spell
save DC, and only if they have reason to be suspicious.
(Knowing that the person should be dead is sufficient
reason.) Spells and abilities that detect undead are also
fooled, but the creature remains susceptible to Turn
Undead as normal.
This spell doesn’t confer the ability to speak on undead
that normally can’t speak. The creature eats, drinks, and
breathes as a living creature does; it can mimic sleep, but it
has no more need for it than it had before.
The effect lasts for a number of hours equal to your
caster level. You can use an action to end the spell early.
Any amount of radiant or necrotic damage dealt to the
creature, or any effect that reduces its Constitution, also
ends the spell.
If this spell is cast on an undead creature that isn’t your
ally or under your control, it makes a Charisma saving
throw to resist the effect.

You alert a number of creatures that you are familiar with,

your intent to communicate with them through spiritual
projection. The invitation can extend any distance and
even cross to other planes of existence. Once notified, the
creatures can choose to accept this communication at any
time during the duration of the spell.
When a creature accepts, its spirit is projected into
one of the gems used in casting the spell. The material
body it leaves behind falls unconscious and doesn't need
food or air. The creature's consciousness is present in the
room with you, and its normal form appears as an astral
projection within 5 feet of the gem its spirit occupies. You
can see and hear all the creatures who have joined in the
assembly, and they can see and hear you and each other as
if they were present (which they are, astrally). They can't
interact with anything physically.
A creature can end the spell's effect on itself voluntarily at
any time, as can you. When the effect ends or the duration
expires, a creature's spirit returns to its body and it regains
consciousness. A creature that withdraws voluntarily from
the assembly can't rejoin it even if the spell is still active. If

An awakened object's speed is 30 feet. If it has no

could make a Strength (Athletics) check to climb a difficult

they're within 60 feet of you and if light from the orb can
reach the space they occupy. An invisible creature still casts
a faint, purple shadow.
The orb can be used as a thrown weapon to attack an
enemy. On a hit, the orb explodes in a flash of light and the
spell ends. The targeted enemy and each creature within
10 feet of it must make a successful Dexterity saving throw
or be blinded for 1 minute. A creature blinded in this way
repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns,
ending the effect on itself on a success.

darkness, causing the illumination level within 20 feet

You touch a melee weapon that was used by an ally who is

that ally’s space and moves when the ally moves. If the

The weapon acts on your turn by making an attack if
a target presents itself. Its attack modifier equals your

You create a sound on a point within range. The sound’s
volume can range from a whisper to a scream, and it can
be any sound you choose. The sound continues unabated
throughout the duration, or you can make discrete sounds
at different times before the spell ends.
Each creature that starts its turn within 30 feet of
the sound and can hear it must make a Wisdom saving
throw. On a failed save, the target must take the Dash
or Disengage action and move toward the sound by the
safest available route on each of its turns. When it arrives
to the source of the sound, the target must use its action
to examine the sound. Once it has examined the sound,
the target determines the sound is illusory and can no
longer hear it, ending the spell’s effects on that target and
preventing the target from being affected by the sound
again for the duration of the spell. If a target takes damage
from you or a creature friendly to you, it is no longer under
the effects of this spell.
Creatures that can’t be charmed are immune to this spell.

Regardless of the time of day or your location, you

successful Charisma saving throw resists the effect and is
not picked out by the moon’s glow.
The glow does not make invisible creatures visible, but
it does indicate an invisible creature’s general location

Description:
Candle’s insight is cast on its target as the component candle
is lit. The candle burns for up to 10 minutes unless it’s
extinguished normally or by the spell’s effect. While the
candle burns, the caster can question the spell’s target, and
the candle reveals whether the target speaks truthfully.
An intentionally misleading or partial answer causes the
flame to flicker and dim. An outright lie causes the flame to
flare and then go out, ending the spell. The candle judges
honesty, not absolute truth; the flame burns steadily
through even an outrageously false statement, as long as
the target believes it’s true.
Candle’s insight is used across society: by merchants while
negotiating deals, by inquisitors investigating heresy, and
by monarchs as they interview foreign diplomats. In some
societies, casting candle’s insight without the consent of the
spell’s target is considered a serious breach of hospitality.

Cleaning away the jam takes an action, but doing so has

be collected in a suitable container. If it's eaten (as a bonus
action) within 24 hours, the jam restores 1d4 hit points.
The jam's flavor is determined by the material component.
The spell can affect constructs, with two limitations.
First, the target creature negates the effect with a
successful Dexterity saving throw. Second, unless the

elbow, and so forth) can be disabled. The affected construct

You imbue an arrow or crossbow bolt with clockwork

mutilate your enemy.
As part of the action used to cast this spell, you make a
ranged weapon attack with a bow or a crossbow against

from spinning blades that briefly sprout from the missile’s
shaft. Afterward, the projectile reverts to normal.

School: Illusion
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 30 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Description:
Choose a creature you can see within range. The target
must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw, which it makes
with disadvantage if it’s in an enclosed space. On a failed
save, the creature believes the world around it is closing in
and threatening to crush it. Even in open or clear terrain,
the creature feels as though it is sinking into a pit, or that
the land is rising around it. The creature has disadvantage
on ability checks and attack rolls for the duration, and it
takes 2d6 psychic damage at the end of each of its turns.
An affected creature repeats the saving throw at the end of
each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell
slot of 4th level or higher, you can target one additional
creature for each slot level above 3rd.

The spell causes the target to grow great, snake-like fangs.
An unwilling creature must make a Wisdom saving throw
to avoid the effect. The spell fails if the target already has a
bite attack that deals poison damage.
If the target doesn’t have a bite attack, it gains one. The
target is proficient with the bite, and it adds its Strength
modifier to the attack and damage rolls. The damage is
piercing and the damage die is a d4.
When the target hits a creature with its bite attack, the
creature must make a Constitution saving throw, taking
3d6 poison damage on a failed save, or half as much
damage on a successful one.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the target’s bite counts
as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and

Choose two living creatures (not constructs or undead)
you can see within range. Each must make a Charisma
saving throw. On a failed save, a creature is compelled to
use its movement to move toward the other creature. Its
route must be as direct as possible, but it avoids dangerous
terrain and enemies. If the creatures are within 5 feet of
each other at the end of either one’s turn, their bodies fuse
together. Fused creatures still take their own turns, but
they can’t move, can’t use reactions, and have disadvantage
on attack rolls, Dexterity saving throws, and Constitution
checks to maintain concentration.
A fused creature can use its action to make a Charisma
saving throw. On a success, the creature breaks free and
can move as it wants. It can become fused again, however,
if it’s within 5 feet of a creature that’s still under the spell’s
effect at the end of either creature’s turn.
Compelled movement doesn’t affect a creature that can’t be
charmed or that is incorporeal.

you can affect increases by one for every two slot levels

You view the actions of a single creature you can see

you can predict that creature’s actions. This has the
following effects:
• You have advantage on attack rolls against the target.
• For every 5 feet the target moves, you can move 5 feet
(up to your normal movement) on the target’s turn
when it has completed its movement. This is deducted
from your next turn’s movement.
• As a reaction at the start of the target’s turn, you
can warn yourself and allies that can hear you of the
target’s offensive intentions; any creature targeted by
the target’s next attack gains a +2 bonus to AC or to its
saving throw against that attack.

see images of shifting terrain. Each target that fails an
Intelligence saving throw is reduced to half speed until the
spell ends because of confusion over its surroundings, and
it makes ranged attack rolls with disadvantage.
Affected creatures also find it impossible to keep
track of their location. They automatically fail Wisdom

harm or impede you and your companions by any means
at its disposal other than direct attacks if the opportunity
arises. At the beginning of the creature’s turn, you can use
your reaction to verbally command it. The creature obeys

If the target tries to cast a spell with a casting time of

an object while taking its action, such as drawing a sword
as part of an attack, it must also roll a d20. On an 11 or

When daggerhawk is cast on a nonmagical dagger, a ghostly
hawk appears around the weapon. The hawk and dagger
fly into the air and make a melee attack against one
creature you select within 60 feet, using your spell attack
modifier and dealing piercing damage equal to 1d4 + your
Intelligence modifier on a hit. On your subsequent turns,
you can use an action to cause the daggerhawk to attack
the same target. The daggerhawk has AC 14 and, although
it’s invulnerable to all damage, a successful attack against
it that deals bludgeoning, force, or slashing damage sends
the daggerhawk tumbling, so it can’t attack again until
after your next turn.

Dark entities herald your entry into combat, instilling an
existential dread in your enemies. Designate a number
of creatures up to your spellcasting ability modifier
(minimum of one) that you can see within range and
that have an alignment different from yours. Each of
those creatures takes 5d8 psychic damage and becomes
frightened of you; a creature that makes a successful
Wisdom saving throw takes half as much damage and is
not frightened.
A creature frightened in this way repeats the saving
throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on
itself on a success. The creature makes this saving throw
with disadvantage if you can see it.

A 30-foot cube centered on you, fills with sticky,
night-black webbing. The webs are difficult terrain
and lightly obscure the area. You are unaffected by the
aforementioned effects of the webs and gain a climbing
speed of 30 feet when moving on the webs.
If the webs aren’t anchored between two solid masses
(such as walls or trees) or layered across a floor, wall, or
ceiling, the web collapses on itself, and the spell ends at
the start of your next turn. Webs layered over a flat surface
have a depth of 5 feet.
Each creature that starts its turn in the webs or that
enters the webs during its turn must make a Dexterity
saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is restrained
for as long as it remains in the webs or until it breaks free.
Each turn that you are in the webs, you can use a bonus
action to siphon life force from every creature restrained
by the webs. Each creature takes 3d6 necrotic damage, and
you regain hit points equal to half the damage dealt.
A creature restrained by the webs can use its action to
make a Strength check against your spell save DC. On a
successful check, it is no longer restrained.
The webs are not flammable, but are susceptible to
radiant damage. Any 5-foot cube of webs exposed to
radiant damage dissipates to nothing in 1 round.

and mimicking your attacks. When you are hit by a melee
attack but the attack roll exceeded your Armor Class by 3
or less, one illusory weapon parries the attack; you take no
damage and the illusory weapon is destroyed. When you
are hit by a melee attack that an illusory weapon can’t parry
(the attack roll exceeds your AC by 4 or more), you take
only half as much damage from the attack, and an illusory
weapon is destroyed. Spells and effects that affect an area
or don’t require an attack roll affect you normally and don’t

with a bonus to hit or to damage. For example, a +1 weapon
would still be considered magical, but it gets neither +1 to

The spell also suppresses other magical properties of
the attack. A sword of wounding, for example, can’t cause
ongoing wounds on you, and you recover hit points lost

Description:
You drink a dose of venom or other poison and spread
the effect to other living things around you. If the poison
normally allows a saving throw, your save automatically
fails. You suffer the effect of the poison normally before
spreading the poison to all other living creatures within
10 feet of you. Instead of making the usual saving throw
against the poison, each creature around you makes
a Constitution saving throw against the spell. On a
successful save, a target suffers no damage or other effect
from the poison and is immune to further castings of doom
of serpent coils for 24 hours. On a failed save, a target doesn't
suffer the poison’s usual effect; instead, it takes 4d6 poison
damage and is poisoned. While poisoned in this way, a
creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its
turns. On a subsequent failed save, it takes 4d6 poison
damage and is still poisoned. On a subsequent successful
save, it is no longer poisoned and is immune to further

Each round, a restrained creature sinks deeper into the
muck. A Medium or smaller creature that is restrained

You create a ripple of dark energy that destroys everything

extradimensional hole appears on a horizontal surface of
sufficient size. Since it extends into another dimension,
the pit has no weight and does not otherwise displace the
original underlying material. You can create the pit in the
deck of a ship as easily as in a dungeon floor or the ground
of a forest.
The pit’s radius expands by 10 feet at the start of your
turn each round for the duration. Any creature standing
in the original conjured space, or on a space taken up by
the pit as it grows, must succeed on a Dexterity saving
throw to avoid falling in. Any creature adjacent to the pit
when it expands must likewise succeed on a Dexterity
saving throw to avoid falling in. Creatures subjected to
a successful pushing effect (such as by a spell like gust of
wind) may not make this saving throw. Creatures that fall
into the pit take falling damage as normal.
The walls of the pit are slick and slimy, requiring a DC
15 Strength (Athletics) check to climb. Creatures and
objects that remain in the pit take 1d6 necrotic damage
at the start of each of their turns. If you fall into your own
pit, you take damage; then the spell ends and you are
incapacitated for 2 rounds. When the spell ends, the floor
of the pit rises, bringing creatures in the pit back up to the
original surface. Each creature in the pit must then make a
Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is
stunned for 2 rounds after the spell ends.

that try to climb or move through the affected area can
move no faster than half speed (this is cumulative with the

Level: 3
School: Conjuration
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 120 feet
Components: V, M (a flower petal or a drop of blood)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Description:
You perform an ancient incantation that summons flora
from the fey realm. A creature you can see within range
is covered with small, purple buds and takes 3d8 necrotic
damage; a successful Wisdom saving throw negates the
damage but doesn’t prevent the plant growth. The buds
can be removed by the target or an ally of the target within
5 feet who uses an action to make a successful Intelligence
(Nature) or Wisdom (Medicine) check against your spell
save DC, or by a greater restoration or blight spell. While
the buds remain, whenever the target takes damage from
a source other than this spell, one bud blossoms into a
purple and yellow flower that deals an extra 1d8 necrotic
damage to the target. Once four blossoms have formed in
this way, the buds can no longer be removed by nonmagical
means. The buds and blossoms wilt and fall away when the
spell ends, provided the creature is still alive.
If a creature affected by this spell dies, sweet-smelling
blossoms quickly cover its body. The flowers wilt and die
after one month.
At Higher Levels. If this spell is cast using a spell slot
of 5th level or higher, the number of targets increases by
one for every two slot levels above 3rd.

You cause earth and stone to rise up beneath your feet,
lifting you up to 5 feet. For the duration, you can use your
movement to cause the slab to skim along the ground or
other solid, horizontal surface at a speed of 60 feet. This
movement ignores difficult terrain. If you are pushed
or moved against your will by any means other than
teleporting, the slab moves with you.
Until the end of your turn, you can enter the space of a
creature up to one size larger than yourself when you take
the Dash action. The creature must make a Strength saving

Name: EARTH WAVE
Level: 5
School: Transmutation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self (15-foot radius)
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 8 hours
Description:
You command the earth beneath your feet to rise and
surge forward, carrying you and your companions where
you bid while rolling over enemies and obstacles in your
path. The earth rises in a 15-foot-high, 15-foot-radius
swell that can carry you and up to eight other Medium
creatures, propelling you in whatever direction you
choose at a rate of up to 90 feet per round. You use
a bonus action to direct the wave each round. Your
movement is limited to the surface of the wave to
maintain control. If you move off the wave, it continues
on the same course you directed it, then the spell ends at
the beginning of your next turn.
Natural obstacles do not impede the spell’s movement;
trees, rocks, and other natural obstacles simply rise up and
around the swell and settle back into place behind it. The
wave can travel up or down natural slopes with angles as
great as 60 degrees.
You can direct the wave to surge over man-made
obstacles and creatures in its path. The swell washes over
walls and other manufactured obstacles up to 15 feet high
and 10 feet thick with no loss of movement, dealing 6d6
bludgeoning damage to an object as it passes. Resolve this
damage against larger, rigid objects, such as walls, vehicles,
or other similar structures; smaller or malleable objects
such as unsecured ropes or cloth are simply buried by the
swell’s passing. Larger objects are subject to the damage,
but the wave cannot move over them unless the damage is
enough to destroy the object.
Creatures of Large size or smaller in the path of the wave
take 6d6 bludgeoning damage and are buried. Buried
creatures are considered restrained and must hold their
breath or begin to suffocate. A creature in the path of the
wave can make a Dexterity saving throw against your
spell save DC. On a successful save, the creature takes half
as much damage and avoids being buried. Each round,
a buried creature can use an action to make a Strength
check against your spell save DC to dig itself out.
You can cast earth wave only when standing on natural
earth or stone. The spell can be cast underground, but not
inside buildings unless they have no floor.

You sing or play a catchy tune that only one creature

creature makes a successful Wisdom saving throw,
the verse becomes ingrained in its head. If the target is
concentrating on a spell, it must make a Constitution
check with disadvantage against your spell save DC in
order to maintain concentration.
For the spell’s duration, the target takes 2d4 psychic
damage at the start of each of its turns as the melody
plays over and over in its mind. The target repeats the
saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the
effect on a success. On a failed save, the target must also
repeat the Constitution check with disadvantage if it is
concentrating on a spell.

You touch a creature with a ring that has been etched
with symbols representing a particular ability (Strength,
Dexterity, and so forth). The creature must make a
successful Constitution saving throw or lose one-fifth
(rounded down) of its points from that ability score.
Those points are absorbed into the ring and stored there
for the spell’s duration. If you then use an action to touch
the ring to another creature on a later turn, the absorbed
ability score points transfer to that creature. Once the
points are transferred to another creature, you don’t need
to maintain concentration on the spell; the recipient
creature retains the transferred ability score points for the
remainder of the hour.
The spell ends if you lose concentration before the
transfer takes place, if either the target or the recipient
dies, or if either the target or the recipient is affected by
a successful dispel magic spell. When the spell ends, the
ability score points return to the original owner. Before
then, that creature can’t regain the stolen attribute points,
even with greater restoration or comparable magic.

You cause slabs of rock to burst out of the ground or other
stone surface to form a hollow, 10-foot cube within range.
A creature inside the cube when it forms must make a
successful Dexterity saving throw or be trapped inside the
stone tomb. The tomb is airtight, with enough air for a
single Medium or Small creature to breathe for 8 hours. If
more than one creature is trapped inside, divide the time
evenly between all the occupants. A Large creature counts
as four Medium creatures. If the creature is still trapped

Description:
You cause the target to radiate a harmful aura. Both the
target and every creature beginning or ending its turn
within 20 feet of the target suffer 2d6 poison damage per
round. The target can make a Constitution saving throw
each round to negate the damage and end the affliction.
Success means the target no longer takes damage from the
aura, but the aura still persists around the target for the
full duration.
Creatures affected by the aura must make a successful
Constitution saving throw each round to negate the
damage. The aura moves with the original target and is
unaffected by gust of wind and similar spells.
The aura does not detect as magical or poison, and is
invisible, odorless, and intangible (though the spell’s
presence can be detected on the original target). Protection
from poison negates the spell’s effects on targets but will
not dispel the aura. A foot of metal or stone, two inches of
lead, or a force effect such as mage armor or wall of force will
block it.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
spell slot of 6th level or higher, the aura lasts 1 minute

make a Strength or Dexterity check (its choice) against your
spell save DC. On a successful save, it frees itself.
For the duration of the spell, the area is difficult terrain.
The spears (AC 14) can be damaged; they are immune to
piercing damage and have resistance to bludgeoning and
slashing damage from nonmagical attacks. If a 5-foot-
square section of spears takes 15 damage, that’s enough to
free a restrained creature or clear the section of spears.

You make natural terrain in a 1-mile cube difficult to
traverse. A creature in the affected area has disadvantage
on Wisdom (Survival) checks to follow tracks or travel
safely through the area, as paths through the terrain seem
to twist and turn nonsensically. The terrain itself isn’t
changed, only the perception of those inside it. A creature
that succeeds on two Wisdom (Survival) checks while in
the terrain discerns the illusion for what it is and sees the
illusory twists and turns superimposed on the terrain.
A creature that reenters the area after exiting it before
the spell ends is affected by the spell even if it previously
succeeded in traversing the terrain. A creature with
truesight can see through the illusion and is unaffected by
the spell. A creature that casts find the path automatically
succeeds in discovering a way out of the terrain.

Duration: 1 hour or until triggered
Description:
This spell functions only against an arcane or divine
spellcaster that prepares spells in advance and that has
at least one unexpended spell slot of 6th level or lower. If
you make a successful melee attack against such a creature
before the spell ends, in addition to the usual effect of that
attack, the target takes 2d4 necrotic damage and one or
more of the victim’s available spell slots are transferred to
you, to be used as your own. Roll a d6; the result equals the
total levels of the slots transferred. Spell slots of the highest
possible level are transferred before lower-level slots.
For example, if you roll a 5 and the target has at least one
5th-level spell slot available, that slot transfers to you. If the
target’s highest available spell slot is 3rd level, then you might
receive a 3rd-level slot and a 2nd-level slot, or a 3rd-level slot
and two 1st-level slots if no 2nd-level slot is available.
If the target has no available spell slots of an appropriate
level—for example, if you roll a 2 and the target has
expended all of its 1st- and 2nd-level spell slots—then grasp
of the tupilak has no effect, including causing no necrotic
damage. If a stolen spell slot is of a higher level than you’re
able to use, treat it as of the highest level you can use.
Unused stolen spell slots disappear, returning whence
they came, when you take a long rest or when the creature
you stole them from receives the benefit of remove curse,
greater restoration, or comparable magic.

Description:
When you cast this spell, choose a direction (north, south,
northeast, or the like). Each creature in a 20-foot-radius
sphere centered on a point you choose within range must
succeed on a Wisdom saving throw when you cast this spell
or be affected by it.
When an affected creature travels, it travels at a fast
pace in the opposite direction of the one you chose, as it
believes a pack of dogs or wolves follows it from the chosen
direction. When an affected creature isn’t traveling, it is
frightened of your chosen direction. The affected creature
occasionally hears howls or sees glowing eyes in the
darkness at the edge of its vision in that direction. An
affected creature will not stop at a destination, instead
pacing half-circles around the destination until the effect
ends, terrified that the pack will overcome it if it stops
moving. An affected creature can make a Wisdom saving
throw at the end of each 4-hour period, ending the effect
on itself on a success.
An affected creature moves along the safest available
route unless it has nowhere to move, such as if it arrives
at the edge of a cliff. When an affected creature can’t
safely move in the opposite direction from your chosen
direction, it cowers in place, defending itself from
hostile creatures, but otherwise takes no actions. In
such circumstances, the affected creature can repeat the
saving throw every minute, ending the effect on itself on
a success. The spell’s effect is suspended when an affected
creature is engaged in combat, enabling it to move as
necessary to face hostile creatures.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
spell slot of 6th level or higher, the duration increases by 4

Duration: 1 hour
Description:
For the duration, you and the creature you touch remain
stable and unconscious if one of you is reduced to 0 hit
points while the other has 1 or more hit points. If you touch
a dying creature, it becomes stable but remains unconscious
while it has 0 hit points. If both of you are reduced to 0
hit points, you must both make death saving throws, as
normal. If you or the target regain hit points, either of you
can choose to split those hit points between the two of you
if both of you are within 60 feet of each other.

Name: HEDREN’S BIRDS OF CLAY
Level: 3
School: Conjuration
Casting Time: 1 action

Components: V, M (a clay figurine shaped like a bird)
Duration: Concentration, up to 5 minutes
Description:
You create a number of clay pigeons equal to 1d4 + your
spellcasting modifier (minimum of one) that swirl around
you. When you are the target of a ranged weapon attack
or a ranged spell attack and before the attack roll is made,
you can use your reaction to shout “Pull!” When you do,
one clay pigeon maneuvers to block the incoming attack.
If the attack roll is less than 10 + your proficiency bonus,
the attack misses. Otherwise, make a check with your
spellcasting ability modifier and compare it to the attack
roll. If your roll is higher, the attack is intercepted and has
no effect. Regardless of whether the attack is intercepted,
one clay pigeon is expended. The spell ends when the last
clay pigeon is used.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
spell slot of 4th level or higher, add 1 to your to your roll
for each slot level above 3rd when determining if an attack
misses or when making a check to intercept the attack.

Name: HEMATOMANCY
Level: 3
School: Divination
Casting Time: 1 minute
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M (a drop of a creature’s blood)
Duration: Instantaneous
Description:
You can learn information about a creature whose blood
you possess. The target must make a Wisdom saving
throw. If the target knows you’re casting the spell, it can
fail the saving throw voluntarily if it wants you to learn the
information. On a successful save, the target isn’t affected,
and you can’t use this spell against it again for 24 hours.
On a failed save, or if the blood belongs to a dead creature,
you learn the following information:
• The target’s most common name (if any).
• The target’s creature type (and subtype, if any), gender,
and which of its ability scores is highest (though not the
exact numerical score).
• The target’s current status (alive, dead, sick, wounded,
healthy, etc.).
• The circumstances of the target shedding the blood
you’re holding (bleeding wound, splatter from an
attack, how long ago it was shed, etc.).
Alternatively, you can forgo all of the above information
and instead use the blood as a beacon to track the target.
For 1 hour, as long as you are on the same plane of
existence as the creature, you know the direction and
distance to the target’s location at the time you cast
this spell. While moving toward the location, if you are
presented with a choice of paths, the spell automatically
indicates which path provides the shortest and most direct
route to the location.

Description:
You infuse the metal of a melee weapon you touch with
the fearsome aura of a mighty hero. The weapon’s wielder
has advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks made
while aggressively brandishing the weapon. In addition,
an opponent that currently has 30 or fewer hit points and
is struck by the weapon must make a successful Charisma
saving throw or be stunned for 1 round. If the creature
has more than 30 hit points but fewer than the weapon’s
wielder currently has, it becomes frightened instead; a
frightened creature repeats the saving throw at the end of
each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a successful
save. A creature that succeeds on the saving throw is
immune to castings of this spell on the same weapon for
24 hours.

raised as undead by magic or by the abilities of monsters,

undead within the area fails automatically. Such spells cast

Name: HOLY VOW
Level: 3
School: Abjuration
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self
Components: V, S, M (a vial of holy water)
Duration: 24 hours
Description:
You willingly take a vow to complete a task or carry out
a service. This task or service cannot conflict with your
alignment or your sacred oath. While you serve under the
vow, for as long as the spell lasts, your hit point maximum
and current hit points increase by 10. Whenever you make
an attack roll or a saving throw, roll a d4 and add the result
to the attack roll or saving throw. These benefits apply
only when you are involved in activities that directly relate
to your avowed task, or to situations you encounter that
interfere with your ability to carry out that task (such as
random encounters while traveling).
If you willingly forsake your vow, the spell ends, and
you take 4d10 psychic damage. At the GM’s discretion,
you might suffer other penalties and need to atone for
your decision. See the “Breaking Your Oath” sidebar in
the paladin class description for more details. Failing to
complete the task does not incur any penalties as long
as you remain true to your vow, nor are you penalized if
some form of outside coercion, magical or otherwise,
leads you to forsake your vow (being charmed, for
instance, or if a villain threatens the lives of innocents if
you do not break the vow).

If you aren’t familiar with the target creature, you must

Until the spell ends, you have advantage on all Wisdom

as if under a geas. In addition, you don’t suffer from
exhaustion levels you gain from pursuing your quarry,
such as from lack of rest or environmental hazards
between you and the target, while the spell is active. When
the spell ends, you suffer from all levels of exhaustion
that were suspended by the spell. The spell ends only after

a 10-foot cube centered on a point within range. It can
hold as many as nine Medium or smaller creatures. The
atmosphere inside the shelter is comfortable and dry,
regardless of the weather outside. The shelter’s camouflage

Description:
worth at least 50 gp)
You write on parchment, paper, or some other
suitable writing material and imbue it with a powerful
enchantment that lasts for the duration. What is actually
written is unimportant; the enchantment laid upon the
words works on the mind of a creature that reads it,
convincing the creature that there is some importance to
the message that must be discovered. A creature that reads
the message must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw
or be compelled to continue reading and rereading the
writing, attempting to glean its meaning and importance.
During combat, a creature so enthralled can take no
actions or reactions on its turn, but can move if it chooses
or needs to do so (to remove itself from danger, for
example). A creature under the influence of the hypnotic
missive can make a new saving throw against the effects
at the beginning of its turn if in a combat situation. In
nonthreatening conditions, the creature can make a new
saving throw against the effects every hour.
Once a creature has made a successful save, it recognizes
the magical compulsion that has affected it. This does
not provide immunity from the spell, however, and if the
creature reads the words again, it must make another save
or fall under the spell’s effects once more.

there is no space available for them. The ice soldiers act
immediately on your turn. You can mentally command
them (no action required by you) to move and act where
and how you desire. If you command an ice soldier to
attack, it attacks that creature exclusively until the target
is dead, at which time the soldier melts into a puddle of
water. If an ice soldier moves farther than 30 feet from
you, it immediately melts. Ice soldiers have the statistics
shown below.

One creature you can see within range must make a
Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature
is petrified (frozen solid). A petrified creature can repeat
the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the
effect on itself if it makes two successful saves. If a petrified
creature gets two failures on the saving throw (not
counting the original failure that caused the petrification),
the petrification becomes permenant.
The petrification also becomes permanent if you
maintain concentration on this spell for a full minute. A
permanently petrified/frozen creature can be restored to
normal with greater restoration or comparable magic, or by
casting this spell on the creature again and maintaining

If the frozen creature is damaged or broken before it

That set of tracks and all other tracks made by the same
creature give off a faint glow. You and up to three creatures
you designate when you cast this spell can see the glow.
A creature that can see the glow automatically succeeds
on Wisdom (Survival) checks to track that creature. If the
tracks are covered by obscuring objects such as leaves or
mud, you and the creatures you designate have advantage
on Wisdom (Survival) checks to follow the tracks.
If the creature leaving the tracks changes its tracks, such
as by adding or removing footwear, the glow stops where
the tracks change. Until the spell ends, you can use an
action to touch and illuminate a new set of tracks.

creature specifically looking for traps that examines the
object must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a successful
save, the creature takes 1d10 psychic damage, the spell
ends, and the creature realizes that the trap was not real.
On a failed save, the creature believes the object contains
a trap. If the creature then tries to disarm or otherwise
interact with the trap in order to set it off, it must make
a Dexterity check against your spell save DC. On a
successful check, the creature takes 1d10 psychic damage
and realizes the trap is not real. On a failed check, the

entire turn to perform its next action due to the creature’s
hesitation. If the creature fails the saving throw by 5 or
more, it takes no action that round. If the creature has
moved before taking an action, its action does not occur

Each wall has two arrow slits. One wall also includes a

at the time of the fort’s creation which creatures can
ignore the lock and enter the fortification. The door has
AC 20 and 60 hit points, and it can be broken open with
a successful DC 25 Strength (Athletics) check. The walls
are made of stone (AC 15) and are immune to necrotic,
poison, and psychic damage. Each 5-foot-square section
of wall has 90 hit points. Reducing a section of wall to 0
hit points destroys it, allowing access to the inside of the
fortification.

With this spell, you instantly transform raw materials
into a siege engine of Large size or smaller (the GM has
information on this topic). The raw materials for the spell
don’t need to be the actual components a siege weapon is
normally built from; they just need to be manufactured
goods made of the appropriate substances (typically
including some form of finished wood and a few bits of
worked metal) and have a gold piece value of no less than
the weapon’s hit points.
For example, a mangonel has 100 hit points. Instant siege
weapon will fashion any collection of raw materials worth
at least 100 gp into a mangonel. Those materials might be
lumber and fittings salvaged from a small house, or 100 gp
worth of finished goods such as three wagons or two heavy
crossbows. The spell also creates enough ammunition for
ten shots, if the siege engine uses ammunition.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a

Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 120 feet
Components: V, S, M (a loop of twine)
Duration: 24 hours
Description:
You create a snare on a point you can see within range.
You can leave the snare as a magical trap, or you can use
your reaction to trigger the trap when a Large or smaller
creature you can see moves within 10 feet of the snare. If
you leave the snare as a trap, a creature must succeed on an
Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom (Perception) check
against your spell save DC to find the trap.
When a Large or smaller creature moves within 5 feet of
the snare, the trap triggers. The creature must succeed on
a Dexterity saving throw or be magically pulled into the
air. The creature is restrained and hangs upside down 5
feet above the snare’s location for 1 minute. A restrained
creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of
its turns, escaping the snare on a success. Alternatively, a
creature, including the restrained target, can use its action
to make an Intelligence (Arcana) check against your spell
save DC. On a success, the restrained creature is freed, and
the snare resets itself 1 minute later. If the creature succeeds
on the check by 5 or more, the snare is destroyed instead.
This spell alerts you with a ping in your mind when the
trap is triggered if you are within 1 mile of the snare. This
ping awakens you if you are sleeping.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell
slot of 3rd level or higher, you can create one additional
snare for each slot level above 2nd. When you receive the
mental ping that a trap was triggered, you know which
snare was triggered if you have more than one.

You touch one creature and choose either to become

a creature to become your champion, it fights on your
behalf. While this spell is in effect, you can cast any spell
with a range of touch on your champion as if the spell had
a range of 60 feet. Your champion’s attacks are considered
magical, and you can use a bonus action on your turn to
encourage your champion, granting it advantage on its
next attack roll.
If you become the champion of another creature, you
gain advantage on all attack rolls against creatures that
have attacked your charge within the last round. If you
are wielding a shield, and a creature within 5 feet of you
attacks your charge, you can use your reaction to impose
disadvantage on the attack roll, as if you had the Protection
fighting style. If you already have the Protection fighting
style, then in addition to imposing disadvantage, you can
also push an enemy 5 feet in any direction away from your
charge when you take your reaction. You can use a bonus
action on your turn to reroll the damage for any successful

10 pounds or less that you can see within range. Tendrils of
blistering air writhe toward the target. A creature holding
or wearing the item must make a Dexterity saving throw.
On a successful save, the creature takes 1d8 fire damage and
the spell has no further effect. On a failed save, the targeted
object melts and is destroyed, and the creature takes 4d8
fire damage if it is wearing the object, or 2d8 fire damage
if it is holding the object. If the object is not being held or
worn by a creature, it is automatically melted and rendered
useless. This spell cannot affect magic items.

Dexterity saving throw negates the piercing damage.
On a failed save, a creature is impaled by a chunk of crystal

causes it to fall to the ground if it was flying. To remove a

same type dealt by its weapon to a hindered creature.
Tracking. A helped creature has advantage on Wisdom

Description:
You target a piece of metal equipment or a metal
construct. If the target is a creature wearing metal armor
or is a construct, it makes a Wisdom saving throw to
negate the effect. On a failed save, the spell causes metal to
cling to metal, making it impossible to move pieces against
each other. This effectively paralyzes a creature that is
made of metal or that is wearing metal armor with moving
pieces; for example, scale mail would lock up because the
scales must slide across each other, but a breastplate would
be unaffected. Limited movement might still be possible,
depending on how extensive the armor is, and speech is
usually not affected. Metal constructs are paralyzed. An
affected creature or construct can repeat the saving throw
at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on
a success. A grease spell dispels lock armor on everything in
its area.

An affected target can’t take reactions and must roll
a d10 at the start of each of its turns to determine its
behavior for that turn.
d10 Behavior
1-3 The creature spends its turn moping like a
lovelorn teenager; it doesn’t move or take actions.
4–5 The creature bursts into tears, takes the Dash

random direction. To determine the direction, roll
a d8 and assign a direction to each die face.
6 The creature uses its action to remove one item
of clothing or piece of armor. Each round spent
removing pieces of armor reduces its AC by 1.
7–8 The creature drops anything it is holding in its
hands and passionately embraces a randomly
determined creature. Treat this as a grapple
attempt which uses the Attack action.
9 The creature flies into a jealous rage and uses its
action to make a melee attack against a randomly

You magnetize a large piece of metal or stone (such as a
door, a stone pillar, or a 5-foot-square section of floor) that
you touch, giving it a powerful attraction to ferrous metal.
Any iron objects within 50 feet of the target that are not
fastened down or being held or worn are pulled toward it,
moving against or up to the target and remaining there.
Any creature located between such an object and the
magnet might be struck; roll a ranged spell attack against
the target’s AC. On a hit, the target takes 2d10 damage of
the appropriate type (bludgeoning for a hammer, slashing
or piercing for a sword, and so forth).
Objects held by or in the possession of a creature are
also attracted. The creature must succeed on a Strength
saving throw to retain a grip on any held or worn objects.
On a successful save, the creature retains possession of
the object, but is dragged 5 feet closer to the magnet.
A creature can voluntarily release a metal object in its
possession and forgo a save.
Creatures garbed in mostly metal armor, or made
of metal, are also attracted to the magnet, and have
disadvantage on their saving throws to avoid being pulled
toward it. If such a creature succeeds on its saving throw,
it can move away from the magnet on its turn, but the
area within 50 feet of the magnet is considered difficult
terrain. If the creature is still in this area at the start of its
next turn, it must make another successful saving throw
to avoid being drawn toward the magnet. A creature that
comes into contact with the magnet is restrained. It can

on a Strength check against your spell save DC to remove
itself from the magnet.

restrained and can move through the difficult terrain of
the ash pit. It doesn’t need to make a Strength or Dexterity
saving throw this turn to not be grabbed by the arms again,
but it must make the saving throw as normal if it’s still in
the ash pit at the start of its next turn.
The diameter of the ash pit increases by 10 feet at the
start of each of your turns for the duration of the spell. The
ash pit remains after the spell ends, but the grasping arms
disappear and restrained creatures are freed automatically.
As the ash slowly cools, it deals 1d6 less fire damage for
each hour that passes after the spell ends.

You cast this spell while touching the cloth doll against

the body reanimates as an undead creature under your

in the animated body. You can use an action to manipulate
the body’s limbs in order to make it move, and you can
see and hear through the body’s eyes and ears, but your
own body becomes unconscious. The animated body can
neither attack nor defend itself. This spell doesn’t change
the appearance of the corpse, so further measures might
be needed if the body is to be used in a way that involves
fooling observers into believing it’s still alive. The spell
ends instantly, and your consciousness returns to your
body, if either your real body or the animated body takes
any damage.
You can’t use any of the target’s abilities except for

combat with you, it will use other attack actions to deal
damage if possible, but will continue to use its bite attack if
it has no other option.
If you are swallowed by a creature, immediately after you
take whatever damage is dealt by the creature’s digestion,

Description:
You cause a fist-sized chunk of stone to appear and hurl
itself against the spell’s target. Make a ranged spell attack.
On a hit, the target takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage and
must roll a d4 when it makes an attack roll or ability check
during its next turn, subtracting the result of the d4 from
the attack or check roll.
The spell’s damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th

Range: 500 feet
Components: V, S, M (a shard of obsidian)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Description:
You point toward an area of ground or a similar surface
within range. A geyser of lava erupts from the chosen spot.
The geyser is 5 feet in diameter and 40 feet high. Each
creature in the cylinder when it erupts or at the start of
your turn takes 10d8 fire damage, or half as much damage
if it makes a successful Dexterity saving throw.
The geyser also forms a pool of lava at its base. Initially,
the pool is the same size as the geyser, but at the start
of each of your turns for the duration, the pool’s radius
increases by 5 feet. A creature in the pool of lava (but not in
the geyser) at the start of your turn takes 5d8 fire damage.
When a creature leaves the pool of lava, its speed is
reduced by half and it has disadvantage on Dexterity
saving throws, caused by a hardening layer of lava. These
penalties last until the creature uses an action to break the
hardened stone away from itself.
If you maintain concentration on pyroclasm for a full
minute, the lava geyser and pool harden into permanent,
nonmagical stone. A creature in either area when the
stone hardens is restrained until the stone is broken away.

blades fill 150 square feet (six 5-foot squares, a circle 15
feet in diameter, or any other pattern you want as long

all places. The blades deal 6d6 slashing damage to each
creature in the area at the moment the spell is cast, or half
as much damage on a successful Dexterity saving throw.
An intelligent undead injured by the blades is frightened
for 1d4 rounds if it fails a Charisma saving throw. Most of
the blades break or are driven into the ground on impact,
but enough survive intact that any single piercing or
slashing melee weapon can be salvaged from the affected
area and used normally if it is claimed before the spell

You trace a glowing black rune in the air which streaks

take no actions while imprisoned, nor can the subject be
targeted or affected by any means. Any spell durations or
conditions affecting the creature are postponed until the
creature is freed. A dying creature does not lose hit points

A creature adjacent to the rune can use a move action

it perceives as transparent as freely and as naturally as it
can shift its focus from nearby to distant objects.
Although the creature can see any target within 30 feet of
itself, all other requirements must still be satisfied before
casting a spell or making an attack against that target.
For example, the creature can see an enemy that has total
cover but can’t shoot that enemy with an arrow because
the cover physically prevents it. That enemy could be
targeted by a geas spell, however, because geas needs only a

Mounts refuse to be ridden, and other animals forget any

You designate a creature you can see within range and
tell it to spin. The creature can resist this command with
a successful Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the
creature spins in place for the duration of the spell. A
spinning creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of
each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. A

used to injure the target)
You create a connection between the target of the spell, an
attacker that injured the target during the last 24 hours,
and the melee weapon that caused the injury, all of which
must be within range when the spell is cast.
For the duration of the spell, whenever the attacker takes
damage while holding the weapon, the target must make
a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes
the same amount and type of damage, or half as much
damage on a successful one. The attacker can use the
weapon on itself and thus cause the target to take identical
damage. A self-inflicted wound hits automatically, but
damage is still rolled randomly.
Once the connection is established, it lasts for the
duration of the spell regardless of range, so long as all
three elements remain on the same plane. The spell ends
immediately if the attacker receives any healing.

Charisma saving throws if spiteful weapon is cast using a

You create a quarterstaff of pure necrotic energy that
blazes with intense purple light; it appears in your chosen
hand. If you let it go, it disappears, though you can
evoke it again as a bonus action if you have maintained
concentration on the spell.
This staff is an extremely unstable and impermanent
magic item; it has 10 charges and does not require
attunement. The wielder can use one of three effects:
• By using your action to make a melee attack and
expending 1 charge, you can attack with it. On a hit, the
target takes 5d10 necrotic damage.
• By expending 2 charges, you can release bolts of
necrotic fire against up to 3 targets as ranged attacks for

Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
Description:
You transform into a living storm cloud, becoming a
swirling mass of black clouds illuminated from within by
flickers of lightning.
While in this form, your only method of movement is a
flying speed of 60 feet. You can enter and occupy the space
of another creature. You have resistance to nonmagical
damage, immunity to lightning damage, and advantage on
Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws. If a
creature strikes you with a melee weapon attack, it takes
3d8 lightning damage. You can pass through small holes,
narrow openings, and even mere cracks, but you treat
liquids as if they were solid surfaces. You can’t fall, and you
remain hovering in the air even if stunned or otherwise
incapacitated. You cannot talk or manipulate objects in
storm cloud form, and any objects you were carrying or
holding can’t be used, dropped, or interacted with in any
way. You cannot cast spells while in this form.
As an action, you can attack an opponent up to 30 feet
away, dealing 3d8 lightning damage on a hit. You can also
use an action to bring down rain upon a 5-foot square
within your reach, drenching it and putting out any
nonmagical fires in that area.
Finally, you can use an action to expand your form to
encompass a 20-foot-radius area, unleashing the storm’s
full fury in a burst of rain, wind, lightning, and thunder.
Each creature in the area is drenched with rain, takes 3d8
lightning and 3d8 thunder damage, is deafened for 1d4
rounds, and is knocked prone. A successful Constitution
saving throw halves the damage and negates the deafened
and prone conditions. Taking this action uses up any
remaining duration of the spell, and you resume your
normal form at the end of your turn.

A powerful wind swirls from your outstretched hand
toward a point you choose within range, where it explodes

20-foot-radius cylinder centered on that point must make
a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature
takes 3d8 bludgeoning damage, is pulled to the center of
the cylinder, and is thrown 50 feet upward into the air. If a
creature hits a solid obstruction when it’s thrown upward
(such as a stone ceiling), it takes bludgeoning damage as if
it had fallen 50 feet, minus the distance it traveled upward.
For example, if a creature hits the ceiling after rising only
10 feet, it takes bludgeoning damage as if it had fallen 40
feet, or 4d6 bludgeoning damage.

range. The storm spreads around corners, and its area
is lightly obscured. Each creature in the storm when it
appears and each a creature that starts its turn in the storm
is affected by the storm.
As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the storm
up to 30 feet. As an action on your turn, you can change
the storm from one type to another, such as from a storm
of bats to a storm of insects.
Bats. The creature takes 4d6 necrotic damage, and its
speed is halved while within the storm as the bats cling to it
and drain its blood.
Birds. The creature takes 4d6 slashing damage, and it has
disadvantage on attack rolls while within the storm as the
birds fly in the way of the creature’s attacks.
Insects. The creature takes 4d6 poison damage, and it
must make a Constitution saving throw each time it casts a
spell while within the storm. On a failed save, the creature
fails to cast the spell, losing the action but not the spell slot.

1 hit point at the start of each of your turns whenever
you are bathed in direct sunlight; 30 minutes or more of
exposure also provides a day’s normal nourishment.
In dim light, the spell’s healing is reduced to 1 hit point
per minute. Normal or magical darkness suppresses
the spell’s effect entirely. While in sunlight, the target
can ignore one level of exhaustion. (The level is only
temporarily removed.)
Undead are especially vulnerable to this spell. If a
targeted undead fails its Wisdom save, it gains the
poisoned condition and suffers radiant damage instead of
healing while in sunlight.

This spell’s effect on the target lasts for the duration of

fungus that’s growing from the ground. The creature can
cling to an appropriate surface with just one hand or with
just its feet, leaving its hands free to wield weapons or cast

You touch a tree and ask one question about anything
that might have happened in its immediate vicinity (such
as “Who passed by here?”). You get a mental sensation
of the response, which lasts for the duration of the spell.
Trees do not have a humanoid’s sense of time, so the
tree might speak about something that happened last
night or a hundred years ago. The sensation you receive
might include sight, hearing, vibration, or smell, all from
the tree’s perspective. Trees are particularly attentive to
anything that might harm the forest and always report
such activities when questioned.
If you cast this spell on a tree that contains a creature
that can merge with trees, such as a dryad, you can freely
communicate with the merged creature for the duration
of the spell.

A golden radiance spreads out from you, providing bright

feet. Any creatures or objects in the area of bright light that
are invisible become visible while they are within 30 feet of
you. Likewise, any magical disguises or illusions within 30

nature obvious. These magical effects return to full potency
if they move more than 30 feet away from you, or vice versa.
When a creature that has taken a different form—
through spells such as polymorph or shapechange, or from
inborn abilities, such as a druid’s wildshape feature—
enters the bright light, it must succeed on a Constitution
saving throw or be forced to return to its original form.

As a bonus action on your turn, you can order the golem

Without orders from you, the statue does nothing.
Whenever the statue has 75 hit points or fewer at the

You infuse yourself, and up to four creatures you touch,
with necromantic energy, taking on aspects of the undead.
The targets gain immunity to poison damage and the
poisoned condition for the duration of the spell, and take
on appearances similar to undead versions of themselves.
Undead that encounter a creature under the effect of this
spell must make an Intelligence saving throw against your
spell save DC. On a failed save, the undead mistakes the
target for another undead creature. Typically this means
the undead will ignore the target, especially if it is a less
intelligent one such as a skeleton or a zombie, unless it is
commanded otherwise. The response of more intelligent
undead might depend on the conditions under which the
encounter occurs, but if the target’s presence would not be
unusual, they too might likely ignore the target unless it

+5 bonus to AC and gives it resistance against nonmagical
bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage for the
duration of the spell.
In addition, the shield can reflect hostile spells back
at their casters. When the target makes a successful
saving throw against a hostile spell, the caster of the spell
immediately becomes the spell’s new target. The caster
is entitled to the appropriate saving throw against the
returned spell, if any, and is affected by the spell as if it
came from a spellcaster of the caster’s level.

Duration: 5 rounds
Your jaws distend and dozens of thin, slimy tentacles
emerge from your mouth to grasp and bind your
opponents. Make a melee spell attack against a foe within
15 feet of you. On a hit, the target takes bludgeoning
damage equal to 2d6 + your Strength modifier and is
grappled (escape DC equal to your spell save DC). Until
this grapple ends, the target is restrained and it takes the
same damage at the start of each of your turns. You can
grapple only one creature at a time.
The Armor Class of the tentacles is equal to yours. If
they take slashing damage equal to 5 + your Constitution
modifier from a single attack, enough tentacles are severed
to enable a grappled creature to escape. Severed tentacles
are replaced by new ones at the start of your turn. Damage
dealt to the tentacles doesn’t affect your hit points.
While the spell is in effect, you are incapable of speech
and can’t cast spells that have verbal components.

This spell creates a wall of swinging axes from the pile of
miniature axes you provide when casting the spell. The
wall fills a rectangle 10 feet wide, 10 feet high, and 20 feet
long. The wall has a base speed of 50 feet, but it can’t take
the Dash action. It can make up to four attacks per round
on your turn, using your spell attack modifier to hit and
with a reach of 10 feet. You direct the wall’s movement
and attacks as a bonus action. If you choose not to direct
it, the wall continues trying to execute the last command
you gave it. The wall can’t use reactions. Each successful
attack deals 4d6 slashing damage, and the damage is
considered magical.
The wall has AC 12 and 200 hit points, and is immune
to necrotic, poison, psychic, and piercing damage. If it is

the wall disappears and the miniature axes fall to the

You can find your way to a destination within 100 miles,
as long as you know for certain that your destination exists
(though you don’t need to have seen or visited it before),
and you must make a successful DC 20 Intelligence check.
If you have the ability to retrace a path you have previously
taken without making a check (as a minotaur or a goristro
can), this check automatically succeeds. On a failed check,
you don't find your path this round, and you and your
companions each take 4d6 psychic damage as the madness
of the shifting maze exacts its toll. You must repeat the
check at the start of each of your turns until you find your
way to your destination or until you die. In either event,
the spell ends.

A creature in the line moving with the wind (away from

Bard CollegeAt 3rd level, a bard gains the Bard College feature. The
following options are available to a bard, in addition to
those in the standard rules.
Bards of the College of Wyrdsingers subscribe to the wyrd,
a philosophy that centers around the phenomenon of the
same name. The wyrd is that which will be, inexorably tied
to such concepts as destiny and fate. Though some might
consider the idea of a fixed destiny fatalistic, the bards of
this college are inspired by this viewpoint. One may not
choose the manner of one’s death, but one can choose how
to meet it, and that idea is at the heart of this college. An
insect might be caught in a spider’s web. Whether it lives or
dies, its struggles ultimately shake the web in its entirety,
and it might free itself through such effort. The struggle
affects all things, however remotely connected they might
be, whereas the insect that merely accepts its death leaves
not even a ripple behind. To confront fate, to embrace the
wyrd and whatever it brings, is to have the power to shake
the world and make it take notice.
When you join the College of Wyrdsingers at 3rd level,
you are already a master of the art of bragging about your
deeds. The fact that you exaggerate is of little importance;
what matters is that boasting of your deeds makes
people listen to you. Your proficiency bonus is doubled
Class Options
when you make a Charisma (Intimidation) or Charisma
(Persuasion) check.
Also beginning at 3rd level, you can use a bonus action
to instill a sense of worth in a single ally within 60 feet
who can hear you. Your ally gains a bonus equal to your
Charisma modifier on attack rolls, damage rolls, ability
checks, and saving throws for a number of rounds equal to
your bard level. That ally cannot benefit from your Bardic
Inspiration until the duration of this feature has run its
course. You can use this feature once at 3rd level, twice
at 8th level, and three times at 15th level. You regain all
expended uses when you finish a long rest.
Additionally, you can use a bonus action to cast any
abjuration spell you know that normally takes 1 action to
cast (for example, laugh in the face of fear, described in this
book, or lesser restoration). Once you use this feature, you
must finish a long rest before you can use it again.
Starting at 6th level, if an ally of yours drops to 0 hit
points, you can use a reaction to expend one of your
uses of Bardic Inspiration. Your ally gains a number of
temporary hit points equal to the die roll and remains
conscious. If the attack that reduced the ally to 0 hit points
would have been fatal, the ally will die if they lose all
temporary hit points they currently possess, unless their
hit point total is raised to 1 or higher before that happens.
At 14th level and higher, you can use an action to sing
a song of valor that enables you to remain courageous
and fight fiercely in the face of the gravest danger. For 1
minute thereafter, you gain immunity to the frightened
condition. Any ally you affect with your Bardic Inspiration
feature also gains this immunity until they expend
the Bardic Inspiration die or the duration expires. In
addition, while this feature is in effect, you add your
Charisma modifier to your weapon damage and to the
damage of any spell you cast.
The Greenleaf College was founded by half-elves who
sought to celebrate their varied heritage. Drawing from
elven lore for inspiration and power, Greenleaf bards
strengthen their connection to nature. Through their
magic and their tales, they convey the rejuvenating
strength of the forests and rivers to their allies.
When you join the Greenleaf College at 3rd level, you gain
proficiency in Nature and two other skills of your choice.
At 3rd level, you learn to infuse your Bardic Inspiration
with a magical seed of healing energy. When a creature uses
a Bardic Inspiration die from you to increase the result of
one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, it also gains
temporary hit points equal to the number rolled on the
Bardic Inspiration die plus your Charisma modifier.
LAND’S STRIDE
Beginning at 6th level, moving through nonmagical
difficult terrain costs you no extra movement. You can also
pass through nonmagical plants without being slowed
by them and without taking damage from them if they
have thorns, spines, or a similar feature. In addition, you
have advantage on saving throws against plants that are
magically created or manipulated to impede movement,
such as those created by the entangle spell.
Starting at 14th level, you can expend one use of Bardic
Inspiration as an action to magically remove one disease
or detrimental condition affecting a creature you can see
within 60 feet. The condition can be blinded, charmed,
deafened, frightened, paralyzed, or poisoned.
Divine DomainsAt 1st level, a cleric gains the Divine Domain
feature. The following domain options are available
to a cleric, in addition to those in the standard rules.
The heady brew of fortitude, courage, and companionship
is your nectar, and you share its blessings with those who
need it.
1st comprehend languages, heroism
3rd blur, bolstering brew*
5th hypnotic pattern, mass healing word
7th confusion, resilient sphere
9th dream, modify memory
* Described in this book
When you choose this domain at 1st level, you learn the
ale-dritch blast cantrip (described in this book). You also
gain proficiency in either Insight or Medicine (your
choice), and you gain proficiency with brewer’s supplies.
Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you
make that uses those supplies.
CHANNEL DIVINITY: BLESSED BREW
Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to
transform a container of nonmagical liquid into blessed
brew; the number of doses equals 3 + your Wisdom
modifier. Any special properties the liquid previously had
are negated. Anyone who imbibes one dose of this brew
can choose one of the following benefits:
• advantage on Charisma-based checks
• a +1 bonus to Armor Class
• a +1 increase to the DC of saving throws against their
castings of enchantment spells
The benefit lasts for 1 hour, leaving behind a warm buzz
when it fades. A creature must finish a short or long rest
before it can again benefit from a dose of blessed brew.
Any blessed brew that is not consumed within an hour
turns into ordinary beer.
CHANNEL DIVINITY: BOOT AND RALLY
Starting at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity
to aid and rally your allies. All friendly creatures within
30 feet of you that are frightened, paralyzed, poisoned, or
stunned gain an immediate saving throw with advantage
to remove the condition. On a succesful save, a creature
also regains 2d6 hit points.
At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon
strikes with radiant energy. Once on each of your turns
when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can
cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 radiant damage to
the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage
increases to 2d8.
At 17th level, you gain resistance to cold, poison, and
psychic damage.
You embody the grace, strength, and resilience of felines.
Eventually, you gain the ability to take the form of a lion or
a tiger.

3rd animal messenger, pass without trace
5th bestow curse, nondetection
7th dimension door, locate creature
9th commune with nature, mislead
When you choose this domain at 1st level, you learn the
true strike cantrip and you gain proficiency in Acrobatics
and Stealth.
CHANNEL DIVINITY: FELINE FINESSE
At 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to add a
+10 bonus to a single Dexterity ability check or Dexterity-
based skill check made by you or someone you designate
within 30 feet. Doing this takes no action on your turn or
a reaction when it’s not your turn. You make this choice
after you see the roll but before the GM says whether the
check succeeds or fails.
Beginning at 6th level, you gain darkvision out to a range
of 60 feet. If you already have darkvision, the range
becomes 90 feet.
At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon
strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns
when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can
cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 damage of the same
type dealt by the weapon to the target. When you reach
14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.
At 17th level, you become a natural lycanthrope. You use
the statistics of a weretiger, though your form can be
that of a werelion, werepanther, wereleopard, or other
large cat, whichever is appropriate for your deity. Your
alignment doesn’t change as a result of this lycanthopy,
and you can’t spread the disease of lycanthropy.
Darkness enshrouds our private affairs and shelters our
secrets. The shadows might protect the hunted from the
hunter or conceal danger. Emissaries of the gods who
claim dominion over the darkness provide protection for
those in need or aid those who hunt in the night, if they are
not themselves the hunters.
1st shadow armor*, sleep
3rd darkness, dark path*
5th legion*, nondetection
7th phantasmal killer, shadow monsters*
9th dark dementing*, mislead
* Described in this book
When you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain
proficiency in either Deception or Stealth (your choice).
While in dim light or darkness, you can take the Hide
action as a bonus action.
CHANNEL DIVINITY: SHADOWSIGHT
Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to
gain darkvision out to a range of 60 feet for 1 hour. If you
already have darkvision, using your Channel Divinity in
this way allows you to see in magical darkness to a distance
of 30 feet as if it were dim light.
CHANNEL DIVINITY: SHADOW MELD
Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity
to merge your current location with the version of it that
exists on the plane of shadow. The affected area is a sphere
with a 60-foot radius centered on you. Within that area,
bright light becomes dim light, dim light becomes darkness,
and darkness becomes equivalent to magical darkness.
The temperature plummets; all creatures other than you
in the darkened sphere at the end of their turns must make
a successful Constitution saving throw or take 1d8 cold
damage. The sphere lasts for 1 minute or until you dismiss
it as a bonus action. There’s a chance, if the GM allows, that
2d4 shadows might step through into your world when the
effect ends. Such creatures might or might not be hostile.
At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon
strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns
when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can
cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 necrotic damage to
the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage
increases to 2d8.
At 17th level, your shadow becomes capable of defending
you. Each time you are hit by a nonmagical attack or effect
that causes damage, your shadow absorbs half of the
damage. When your shadow has absorbed damage equal to
one-fourth of your maximum hit points, it goes dormant
until you finish a long rest.
Dragons are known for many marvelous qualities:
mastery of the most unforgiving environments, sagacity,
long life, and an eternal hunger for ever more wealth and
power. Those who worship dragons or the gods of dragons
might strive to emulate several, or perhaps all, of these
qualities themselves.
1st detect magic, thunderwave
3rd lair sense*, enthrall
5th catch the breath*, fear
7th blight, scale rot*
9th claws of the earth dragon*, legend lore

proficiency in Arcana, and your proficiency bonus is
doubled for any ability check you make that uses this skill.
You also gain advantage on saving throws against being
frightened.
CHANNEL DIVINITY: CHARMER OF REPTILES
Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity
to charm nonintelligent reptiles. As an action, you present
your holy symbol and invoke the name of your deity. Each
reptilian beast within 30 feet of you that can see you must
make a successful Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by
you for 1 minute or until it takes damage. While a reptile is
charmed by you, it is friendly to you and to other creatures
you designate.
CHANNEL DIVINITY: DRAGON’S RESISTANCE
Starting at 6th level, as a reaction when you fail a saving
throw, you can use your Channel Divinity to succeed on
that saving throw instead.
At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon
strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns
when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can
cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 damage of the type
dealt by the weapon to the target. When you reach 14th
level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.
At 17th level, you gain a Frightful Presence action option
similar to a dragon’s. After you use an action to invoke it,
you must finish a short or long rest before using it again.
Frightful Presence. Each creature of your choice that is
within 60 feet of you and aware of you must succeed on a
DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1
minute. A frightened creature repeats the saving throw at
the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on
a success. If a creature’s saving throw is successful or the
effect ends for it, the creature is immune to your Frightful
Presence for the next 24 hours.
You have dedicated your life to the satisfaction of your
appetites, sometimes without regard for others’ needs.
You realize you can never be truly sated, but you also know
that remaining hungry is the key to amassing power.
1st false life, goodberry
3rd locate animals or plants, suggestion
5th create food and water, vampiric touch
7th blight, desiccating breath*

and proficiency with cooking tools.

CHANNEL DIVINITY: FEROCIOUS FEAST
At 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to gain a
bite attack for 1 minute. The bite deals piercing damage
equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier. On a critical hit,
you can add your Wisdom modifier to the damage roll in
addition to the normal benefits.
Beginning at 6th level, you can remove the effect of a
disease, a poison or the poisoned condition, or one level of
exhaustion from yourself as an action. You must finish a
long rest before using this ability again.
At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon
strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns
when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can
cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 necrotic damage to
the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage
increases to 2d8.
At 17th level, you can sacrifice the vitality of those around
you and inspire an insatiable and horrifying hunger in
them. Each living creature within 60 feet of you that fails
a Charisma saving throw takes 10d8 necrotic damage and
then succumbs to a ravening hunger, dropping whatever
it holds and attacking unaffected creatures with their
hands and teeth, or with whatever natural weapons they
possess, in an attempt to devour them. This effect lasts for
a number of rounds equal to 3 + your Wisdom modifier.
An affected creature repeats the saving throw at the end of
each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
You can exclude up to ten creatures from the effect, but
this doesn’t shield them against being attacked by those
who do succumb. This ability doesn’t affect constructs or
the undead.
You are master of the hunt. The bounty of the land is yours
for the taking.
1st hunter’s mark, strength of an ox*

camouflage yourself in any environment, gaining advantage
on Stealth checks made to move quietly or to hide. You also
leave no scent. The effect lasts for a number of rounds equal
to your cleric level + your Wisdom modifier.
At 6th level, you can select a favored enemy as if you were
a ranger. You gain all the benefits of the ranger’s Favored
Enemy feature with one exception: you choose additional
favored enemies (and languages) at 10th level and 16th
level instead of at 6th level and 14th level.
At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon
strikes with divine energy. On your turn, you can cause
one successful weapon attack against a creature to deal
an extra 1d8 damage of the type dealt by the weapon to
the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage
increases to 2d8.
At 17th level, you can use an action to describe or name
a creature that is familiar to you or that you can see
within 120 feet. For 24 hours or until the target is dead,
whichever occurs first, you have advantage on Wisdom
(Survival) checks to track your target and Wisdom
(Perception) checks to detect your target. In addition, you
have advantage on weapon attack rolls against the target.
You can’t use this feature again until you finish a short or
long rest.
All seek some form of justice when they have been
wronged, and many live under the promise of its
protection—whether or not the promise is ultimately
kept—but few take on the holy burden of delivering
the justice of the gods. The mercy of the divine, when in
evidence at all, is not the mercy of mortals, and meting out
divine justice makes for a lonely life. Yet someone must
make the sacrifice.
1st fist of iron*, longstrider
3rd blade of wrath*, see invisibility
5th call lightning, fear
7th inspiring speech, faithful hound
9th dominate person, hold monster
* Described in this book

creature that is guilty of an injustice or that is wanted
for commission of a serious crime. At 7th level, you can
determine the distance in miles to the creature as well as
the direction.
At 6th level, you become immune to the frightened
condition.
At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon
strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns
when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can
cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 radiant damage to
the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage
increases to 2d8.
CHANNEL DIVINITY: HOLY DENUNCIATION
At 17th level, you can use your Channel Divinity to
persuade others that you hold divine authority to mete
out justice. You must present your holy symbol and invoke
the name of your deity. As long as your deity is worshiped
openly in the land where you are asserting this authority,
you have advantage on Wisdom checks and Charisma
checks involving justice, judgment, and the law.
The savage and cunning god of the minotaurs has few
followers, but those who heed the call gain the ability to
smash and confound their foes. The Labyrinth domain
grants powers associated with the mazes that minotaurs
love and with misleading enemies. The maze is your holy
temple, and its winding corridors and deadly traps are the
hallmarks of your faith.
1st alarm, expeditious retreat
3rd by the light of the moon*, pass without trace
5th confound senses*, nondetection
7th dimension door, moon trap*

CHANNEL DIVINITY:
At 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to gain
advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks for the purpose of
tracking for 1 hour.
Beginning at 6th level, you can make a melee attack that
causes a creature to become confused for 1 round. If
your attack hits, you deal no damage, but the creature is
confused (as the confusion spell) until the start of your next
turn. You expend one use of this ability whether the attack
hits or misses. You can use this ability a number of times
per day equal to 3 + your Wisdom modifier, and you regain
all expended uses when you finish a long rest. This ability
has no effect on minotaurs or on creatures that have a
challenge rating higher than your cleric level.
At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon
strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns
when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can
cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 damage of the same
type dealt by the weapon to the target. When you reach
14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.
At 17th level, you gain the power to banish one creature
you can see within 60 feet to an extradimensional
labyrinth, similar to the effect of the maze spell. The
duration is a number of rounds equal to half your cleric
level, unless you end it early by using a bonus action. The
target resists the effect with a successful Wisdom saving
throw; on a failed save, it is transported into the labyrinth.
The target that was sent to the maze can search for
the exit. On its turn, it uses its action to make a DC 20
Intelligence check; if the check succeeds, the creature
escapes from the labyrinth and returns to its previous
location.
Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you
finish a long rest.
You are an initiate into the quiet mysteries of the moon
and the subtleties of the night. Your faith illuminates any
darkness you face.

disadvantage on Stealth checks when you wear medium
armor.
CHANNEL DIVINITY: NIGHT’S CHILL
Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity
to harness moonlight, which banishes magical light and
deals cold damage to your foes. When you present your
holy symbol as an action and use your Channel Divinity,
any magical light within 30 feet of you is dispelled.
Additionally, each hostile creature within 30 feet of you
takes cold damage equal to 2d10 + your cleric level, or half
as much damage with a successful Constitution saving
throw. A creature that has total cover from you is not
affected.
At 6th level, you can emit a nimbus of light in a 30-foot
radius for a number of rounds equal to your cleric level.
This effect acts as a light spell but provides only dim light.
All weapons and ammunition are treated as silvered
while they’re in the aura and for 1 round after leaving it.
Opponents that end their turn in the aura must make a
successful Dexterity saving throw or be limned in silver
light, identical in effect to a faerie fire spell, until the end of
their next turn.
You can use this feature three times, and you regain
expended uses when you finish a long rest.
At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon
strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns
when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can
cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 cold damage to the
target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage
increases to 2d8.
Beginning at 17th level, whenever the moon is visible in
the sky, you can use an action to detect magical pathways,
portals, and gate effects. To be detected, a portal must
be within your line of sight and no farther than 120 feet
from you. Detected portals are visible only to you, but you
can point out their locations to others. Once you use this
feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or
long rest.
Mountains signify strength, endurance, and hard-won
wisdom. Many gods make their homes in the mountains,
and so do many horrors. Those who would know
themselves in full must embrace the ordeal of scaling the
highest peaks, despite the thin, cold air, deprivation, and
hardships that await.
1st feather fall, jump

skill or ability checks made to climb, avoid falling, or avoid
the prone condition. The effect lasts for 1 hour.

of 30 feet. If you already have darkvision, you can see in
magical darkness out to a range of 30 feet as if it were dim
light.
At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon
strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns
when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can
cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 cold damage to the
target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage
increases to 2d8.
At 17th level, you can create an avalanche that crushes and
buries everything in its path. A 60-foot cone of ice, snow,
and rubble erupts from a point of your choosing within
20 feet of you, in a direction you select. Each creature
in the cone takes 15d8 bludgeoning damage, or half as
much damage with a successful Strength saving throw. A
creature that fails the saving throw is also restrained. A
restrained creature can be freed by spending an action to
make a successful Strength check, either by itself or by an
ally within 5 feet of it.
You must be outdoors to create the avalanche. The
direction of the cone must be downhill or level; the
avalanche can’t flow upill. Walls and other permanent
structures block the avalanche. After using this feature,
you must finish a long rest before using it again.
You invoke the power of salt and sea—the fountain of
life—in all its chaotic glory. You are an emissary between
sea and shore.

darkvision, its range extends by 30 feet.
At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon
strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns
when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can
cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 cold damage to the
target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage
increases to 2d8.
At 17th level, you become able to breathe in water as easily
as in air. You also gain the ability to transform your skin
into fishlike scales at will. While covered in scales, you have
resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage
from nonmagical weapons, and you have advantage on
Dexterity (Stealth) checks made in natural underwater
environments. You must use an action to grow the scales
or to transform back to your normal skin. The scales can be
any color you choose. The scales need to be kept wet; you
gain one level of exhaustion at the end of each hour when
you have scales and they haven't been thoroughly wetted
for that length of time.
You see the future, whether for good or ill. Eventually, you
might become an oracle renowned across the region.

to add 20 feet to your walking speed for a number of
rounds equal to your cleric level.
CHANNEL DIVINITY: FUTURE SIGHT
At 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity to declare
that an action or movement you just performed did not
happen, allowing you to take a different action or make
a different movement. You can do this after the result
of your activity is known, so long as it didn’t result in
your unconsciousness or death. Only a single action or
movement can be nullified. The mixing of future and
present is disorienting, so you gain one level of exhaustion
after using this ability.
At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon
strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns
when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can
cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 damage of the same
type dealt by the weapon to the target. When you reach
14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.
At 17th level, you gain advantage on Dexterity saving
throws, Wisdom (Perception) checks, and Wisdom
(Insight) checks. You also gain resistance to fire, poison,

With the GM’s consent, you can issue a prophecy from
your deity once per month. You might become a renowned
(and controversial) prophet, attracting both loyal followers
and terrible enemies. Consult with your GM to find out
what news, if any, your deity wants foretold.
In speed and skill there is power, and you serve your faith
by engaging in acts of incredible quickness and agility.
Eventually you become able to control time itself.

CHANNEL DIVINITY: BURST OF SPEED
Beginning at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity
to grant yourself or another creature greater speed. When
you use an action to touch a creature, the target adds 10
feet to its walking speed. It also gains the benefit of a bless
spell, but only on attacks and saving throws that rely on
Dexterity. This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to
3 + your Wisdom modifier.
At 6th level, your speed increases by another 5 feet. Also,
as a reaction or a bonus action, you can increase your
Dexterity modifier by +5 until the end of your current
turn. This benefit can be used for all purposes except
attack rolls. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it
again until you finish a long rest.
At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon
strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns
when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can
cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 damage of the same
type dealt by the weapon to the target. When you reach
14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.
CHANNEL DIVINITY: TIME STOP
At 17th level, you can use your Channel Divinity to stop
the flow of time. The effect is identical to the time stop
spell; you can take three turns in a row when the effect is
triggered. You must finish a long rest before using this
ability again.
The gods that deal with time are varied. Some see into
the future and past; others deal with the cycles of life
that mark the passage of time—birth and death, the
seasons, or renewal and decay—or have some particular
connection to the timeline, such as gods of creation or
apocalypse do. The clerics of such gods are often granted
powers that allow them to see through or manipulate
time, emulating their deities and enabling them to alter
events as their gods see fit.
1st auspicious warning*, feather fall
3rd decelerate*, gentle repose
5th haste, slow
7th flickering fate*, reset*
9th modify memory, wall of time*
* Described in this book
When you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain
proficiency in Insight and Perception, and your proficiency
bonus is doubled for any
ability check you make
that uses either of
those skills.
Additionally, whenever you might be surprised, you can
make a Wisdom saving throw against a DC equal to the
highest result among the enemy’s initiative rolls. On a
successful save, you are not surprised.
CHANNEL DIVINITY: TIME SHIFT
Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity
to shift time and alter the order of initiative. As an action,
you can move yourself in the initiative order to any point of
your choosing.
CHANNEL DIVINITY: GROUP TIME SHIFT
Starting at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity to
shift time for others as well as yourself. Choose up to three
allies. When you use your Channel Divinity, you can also
move them in the initiative order to any positions of your
choosing. An allied creature can choose not to be affected.
Beginning at 8th level, you intuitively know where your
enemies will be in the immediate future and how they will
attack. You gain advantage on one attack roll each turn
when you take the Attack action. Alternatively, you can take
a reaction when a creature attacks you to give that creature
disadvantage on its attack roll against you.
At 17th level, you add foresight and time stop to your spell list.
You are never surprised, and whenever you and your allies
might be surprised, you can grant up to six allies the ability
to make Wisdom saving throws to avoid being surprised, as
if they had your Prescient Glimpses feature.
Voyages across oceans, over mountain ranges, through
steaming jungles, and from one world to the next all have
an aspect of the sacred to them. The wisdom, knowledge,
and prosperity gained through furthering one’s experience
of the world also venerates the gods who made such places
and those who watch over such journeys. An agent of one
of these deities might be in some demand as a charm to
help ensure safe travel, though the wise know that the gods
often consider an easy journey to be less beneficial to the
traveler’s spirit.
1st comprehend languages, longstrider
3rd find steed, pass without trace
5th haste, water walk
7th dimension door, freedom of movement
9th passwall, teleportation circle
When you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain
proficiency in one of the following skills of your choice:
Insight, Nature, or Survival. In addition, you learn two
standard languages of your choice and gain proficiency
with cartographer’s tools.
CHANNEL DIVINITY: REINVIGORATE
Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity
to remove one level of exhaustion from yourself or from
someone else you touch.
Beginning at 6th level, if you are planning to travel any
distance longer than 5 days’ travel and you have a map of
the region to be traversed or firsthand knowledge of the
area, you can find a shortcut. Using the alternate path can
reduce your travel time by 50 percent.
At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon
strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns
when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can
cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 lightning damage to
the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage
increases to 2d8.
At 17th level, you ignore difficult terrain and you gain
resistance to cold and fire damage.
Nearly every part of the world must deal with a change
in temperature and the coming of winter. Nowhere
is this more evident than in the extreme north and
extreme south, where winter is a pervasive part of life.
As civilization expands into inhospitable terrain and
environments, its reliance increases on divine providence
to ensure survivability.
Good-aligned clerics appeal to winter deities such as
Boreas to spare their people the worst of bitter cold,
storms that last for days, and other calamities caused
by weather. They couch the onset of winter as necessary
for strengthening their people and as a respite from toil,
pointing to the peacefulness of the frozen, snow-draped
landscape. Evil clerics embrace the storms and brutal
conditions and even enhance them to advance their
deities’ agendas and to spread fear through their enemies.
1st breathtaking wind*, icicle daggers*
3rd creeping ice*, sheen of ice
5th sleet storm, steal warmth*
7th fusillade of ice*, ice storm
9th clash of glaciers*, cone of cold
* Described in this book
At 1st level, you learn the ray of frost cantrip and you gain
proficiency in Nature and Survival.
CHANNEL DIVINITY: SNOW WALKER
Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity
to grant yourself the ability to walk on the surface of snow,
ignoring any movement penalties that would normally
apply. Ice supports your weight no matter how thin the ice
is, and you can travel on it as if you’re wearing ice skates.
You still leave tracks on snow and ice.
Additionally, in snowy environments, your vision is not
impaired by snow and you have advantage on Dexterity
(Stealth) checks to hide.
Beginning at 6th level, when you deal cold damage to a
creature, it must make a successful Constitution saving
throw against your spell save DC or become stunned until
the end of its next turn.
At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon
strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns
when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can
cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 cold damage to the
target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage
increases to 2d8.
BRINGER OF WINTER’S WRATH
Starting at 17th level, you gain resistance to cold.
Additionally, you can use your action to surround
yourself with swirling snow that fills a 20-foot radius.
All other creatures have disadvantage on Wisdom
(Perception) checks and attack rolls against you.
Creatures other than you inside the snow-filled area have
disadvantage on saving throws against magic that deals
cold damage. The swirling snow lasts for 1 minute or until
you dismiss it as a bonus action.
Druid CirclesAt 2nd level, a druid gains the Druid Circle feature. The
following options are available to a druid, in addition to
those in the standard rules.
There is power in the ancient trees of the world—a quiet,
abiding power. Those who live among trees, like the elves,
are aware of this power, and they treat it with respect,
even reverence. Some druids learn to tap into this power.
These are the members of the Circle of Oaks. By suffusing
themselves with the vitality and strength of the ancient
green, they can perform mighty feats. Although they
commonly hail from the ancient forests of the world,
Circle of Oaks druids can be found anywhere there are
trees of sufficient age from which to draw power.
3rd locate animals or plants, pass without trace
5th plant growth, speak with plants
7th conjure woodland beings, locate creature
9th awaken, tree stride
Starting at 6th level, you can spend half your movement to
magically step into a tree and transport yourself through
it and out of another tree of the same kind within 60 feet,
reappearing in a space of your choice within 5 feet of the
destination tree. You can use this feature twice when you
reach 10th level, and three times at 14th level, when the
range becomes 120 feet. You regain all expended uses
when you finish a long rest.
At 10th level, you can expend two uses of Wild Shape at the
same time to transform into a tree-like humanoid, similar
to a treant, though not as powerful. While in this form, you
are a Large plant, and you have the following statistics:
AC 15 Hit Points 10d10 + 50
Speed 30 ft.
Strength 22 (+6); Dexterity 9 (–1); Constitution 20 (+5)
Damage Resistances bludgeoning, piercing
Damage Vulnerabilities fire
False Appearance While you remain motionless, you are
indistinguishable from a tree.
Multiattack You make two slam attacks.
Slam. Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.
Hit: 14 (2d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage
Rock. Ranged Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, range 60/180 ft., one
target. Hit: 21 (3d10 + 5) bludgeoning damage.
At 14th level, you can use an action on your turn to stir
the trees around you, bringing them to your aid. All
trees within 60 feet of you become animated, their roots
churning the earth and their branches whipping and
slashing. All spaces within 15 feet of a tree are considered
difficult terrain for your enemies, but not for you or your
allies. A creature concentrating on a spell that starts
its turn in one of the affected spaces must succeed on a
Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or
lose concentration on the spell.
Also, you can use a bonus action on your turn to cause
one affected tree to strike a creature within 15 feet of it
with a branch. Make an attack roll, using your spellcasting
ability modifier as a bonus to the roll. On a hit, the creature
takes 4d6 bludgeoning damage. You can use this feature
for a number of rounds equal to your druid level; these
rounds need not be consecutive. You regain the full use of
this feature when you finish a long rest.
If this feature is used underground, beneath an area
where trees grow, the effect is the same, except it is the
trees’ roots that burst through walls into rooms or tunnels,
producing the same effects. If the GM decides the area is
too far underground or is otherwise unsuitable for this
feature to be used, it has no effect.
Druids of the Circle of Owls maintain their tradition
of spying and gathering knowledge and, occasionally,
of permanently silencing those who would misuse
knowledge. The Circle of Owls druids draw on the power
of their namesakes, moving about the world unnoticed as
they see and hear what others try desperately to hide.
The ever-present eyes and ears of the natural world impart
magical knowledge to you. At 2nd level, you learn the
message cantrip. At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th levels, you gain
access to the spells listed for those levels in the Circle of
Owls Spells table.
Once you gain access to a circle spell, you always have
it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of
spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a
spell that doesn’t appear on the druid spell list, the spell is
nonetheless a druid spell for you.
3rd detect thoughts, invisibility
5th nondetection, sending
7th arcane eye, private sanctum
9th modify memory, scrying
When you choose this circle at 2nd level, you gain
proficiency in either Deception or Stealth.
Starting at 2nd level, you can magically evade the notice
of even those who watch you. You can take the Hide
action even when other creatures can see you. If you hide
successfully, you remain hidden in this way until the end of
your next turn (or sooner, if you choose to stop hiding).
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your
Wisdom modifier (minimum of once). You regain all
expended uses when you finish a long rest.
OWL’S EYES
At 6th level, you can cast the clairvoyance spell. When you
cast the spell in this way, you don’t require components,
and the casting time is 1 action. You can choose for the
invisible sensor to instead be visible as the image of an owl.
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you
finish a long rest.
At 10th level, you can slip partially into shadow for a short
time. As an action, you can cast the etherealness spell. When
you cast the spell in this way, its duration is concentration,
up to 1 minute.
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you
finish a short or long rest.
When you reach 14th level, you can disperse your form
into a swirling storm of owls. As an action, you can use
your Wild Shape to become a swarm of owls, which uses
the statistics of a swarm of ravens.
Druids of the Circle of Roses use the power of nature to
influence the minds and hearts of those around them,
alleviating sorrow, spreading terror, and ensnaring hearts
in equal measure. They create sweet and bitter perfumes
that transmit their power to any who inhale the scent.
Your bond with the ebb and flow of nature grants you
knowledge of certain spells. At 2nd level, you learn the
friends cantrip. At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th levels, you gain
access to the spells listed for those levels in the Circle of
Roses Spells table.
Once you gain access to a circle spell, you always have
it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of
spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a
spell that doesn’t appear on the druid spell list, the spell is
nonetheless a druid spell for you.
3rd calm emotions, suggestion
5th hypnotic pattern, tongues
7th confusion, phantasmal killer
9th dominate person, geas
When you choose this circle at 2nd level, you gain
proficiency in Deception, Intimidation, or Persuasion.
Starting at 2nd level, you can expend one use of your
Wild Shape as an action to create a floral perfume that
manipulates the minds of those who breathe it. One
creature of your choice within 10 feet of you must make a
Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC.
On each of your turns while the perfume lasts,
you can use an action to choose a different
creature within 10 feet of you to affect with
your perfume.
On a failed save, the creature is charmed by you
or frightened (your choice) for as long as it remains
in the area of your perfume and for 1 minute after it
leaves the area. If it ends its turn outside the area, the
creature can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect
on itself on a success. If you or your allies attack or
harm a charmed creature, it is no longer charmed.
If the creature’s saving throw is successful or if the
effect ends for it, it is immune to your perfume for the
next 24 hours. A creature that doesn’t breathe or that is
immune to poison is immune to your perfume.
The perfume lasts for 10 minutes or until you use your
Wild Shape again.
At 6th level, your perfume can affect one creature of your
choice within 20 feet of you, and you can use the scent
to offset harmful effects. When you use your Bittersweet
Perfume, you can choose to end one disease or one
condition affecting a creature in your perfume instead of
charming or frightening it. The condition removed can be
charmed, frightened, or poisoned.
ROSE’S THORNS
At 10th level, you can stab thorns at the minds of those
who dare to take you on. When a creature within 20 feet
of you hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction
to force the creature to make a Wisdom saving throw
against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature
takes 1d10 psychic damage.
When you reach 14th level, a whiff of your perfume
surrounds you at all times and lingers in your wake.
You are immune to harmful gases and vapors, you have
advantage on saving throws against becoming charmed or
frightened, and your Bittersweet Perfume now lasts for 1
hour or until you use your Wild Shape again.
In addition, you can intensify the power of your
perfume. When a creature becomes charmed or frightened
from your Bittersweet Perfume, you can use a bonus
action to wrap some of your perfume around it. That
creature is considered to be in the area of your perfume,
no matter how far it moves away from you, for 1 hour or
until you use your Wild Shape again. Once you use this
feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.
Some druids tend to more than the land. They also show
concern for the health of the spirits of the land. Druids
of the Circle of the Spirits build shrines in the wilderness
where they commune with both these spirits and the souls
of the departed.
Starting at 2nd level, you gain the service of a minor spirit
guide. You can cast find familiar as a ritual.
As long as you and your spirit guide (familiar) are within
100 feet of each other, the spirit guide can maintain
concentration on a druid spell you cast. You must choose
whether to do so yourself or make your spirit guide
responsible for maintaining concentration at the moment
the spell is cast, and that decision can’t be changed on a
later turn. You can still have only one concentration spell
in effect at a time; if you concentrate on a different spell
or effect, the spirit guide’s concentration ends. You can
still share your spirit guide’s senses and cast touch spells
through the spirit guide normally while it’s maintaining
concentration. The spirit guide makes Constitution saving
throws to maintain concentration when it takes damage,
not when you take damage.
Your bond with the spirits of nature grants you knowledge
of certain spells. At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th levels, you gain
access to the spells listed for those levels in the Circle of
Spirits Spells table.
Once you gain access to a circle spell, you always have
it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of
spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a
spell that doesn’t appear on the druid spell list, the spell is
nonetheless a druid spell for you.
3rd augury, invisibility
5th speak with dead, spirit guardians
7th divination, hallucinatory terrain
9th antilife shell, scrying
Starting at 6th level, as a bonus action you can engage in a
dance to channel the power of the spirit world. If you cast
a druid spell on your next turn, one target of the spell has
disadvantage on its first saving throw against the spell.
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you
finish a short or long rest.
At 10th level, the spirits rush to your aid when you’re
grievously wounded. When you are reduced to 0 hit points
but not killed outright, you are reduced to 1 hit point
instead. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again
until you finish a long rest.
When you reach 14th level, as an action you can dissolve
your flesh into ectoplasm for up to 1 minute. For the
duration:
• You gain a flying speed equal to your base walking
speed.
• You have resistance to acid, cold, fire, lightning,
thunder, and nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and
slashing damage.
• You can’t be grappled, petrified, knocked prone, or
restrained.
• You can move through creatures and solid objects as
if they were difficult terrain, but you take 1d10 force
damage if you end your turn inside an object.
Maintaining this feature requires concentration as if
it were a spell. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it
again until you finish a short or long rest.
Martial
Archetype
At 3rd level, a fighter gains the Martial Archetype feature.
The following option is available to a fighter, in addition to
those in the standard rules.
The archetypal Prescient Knight is the culmination of
long years of study and dedication to the craft of combat,
supplemented by the use of magic that provides a glimpse
of the future or makes it possible to turn back the hands
of time.
When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain
proficiency in Arcana.
Also at 3rd level, you become able to innately anticipate the
actions of your foes. You can take a second reaction during
a round in which you use your Action Surge.
3rd Bonus Proficiency, Reactive Echo,
Spellcasting, Martial Caster
7th Constant Vigilance
10th Evasion
15th Anticipatory Strike
18th Action Free of Thought
When you reach 3rd level, you augment your martial
prowess with the ability to cast spells.
Cantrips. You learn two cantrips of your choice from
among guidance, quicken (described in this book), and true
strike. You learn the remaining cantrip of the three at 10th
level.
Spell Slots. The Prescient Knight Spellcasting table
indicates how many spell slots you have available for
casting spells. You regain used spell slots when you finish a
long rest.

Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher. You know three
1st-level spells of your choice, all of which you must choose
from the divination and temporal spells on the wizard
spell list.
The Spells Known column of the Prescient Knight
Spellcasting table shows when you learn more wizard
spells of 1st level or higher. You learn additional spells as
you progress; newly learned spells have the same school
and list restrictions as your original spells.
Whenever you gain a level, you can replace one spell you
know with another from among those spells you are able
to learn.
Spellcasting Ability. Intelligence is your spellcasting
ability for your wizard spells. You use your Intelligence
modifier when you make an attack roll with a spell and
when setting the saving throw DC for a spell you cast.
At 3rd level and higher, you can perform somatic
components for your spells while you are wielding a
weapon or a shield, as long as you have proficiency with
those items.
Beginning at 7th level, you have a preternatural awareness
of your surroundings in times of duress. If you are
surprised but not incapacitated at the start of combat,
you can use your Action Surge to negate surprise for
yourself and take a normal turn plus one additional action
(from the Action Surge) in the first round of combat.
Additionally, using your Action Surge in this way allows
you to give sufficient warning to allies who are within 15
feet of you, so they can also start taking reactions after
your turn.
At 10th level, your foreknowledge of events to come allows
you to position yourself in the most advantageous manner.
When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to
make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage,
you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving
throw, and only half damage if you fail.
At 15th level, your innate connection to the threads of fate
strengthens, providing greater insight into the movements
and actions of your opponents. When you use your Action
Surge, you have advantage on attack rolls and a +2 bonus
to your AC until the end of your next turn.
At 18th level, your mastery of divination and temporal
effects is such that you are able to react to your opponents
without conscious thought and with minimal physical
effort. During combat, you can take one reaction every
turn instead of one per round.
Sacred OathsAt 3rd level, a paladin gains the Sacred Oath feature. The
following options are available to a paladin, in addition to
those in the standard rules.
The Oath of Radiance is a beacon in the night, burning
away the corruption of shadow and undeath. Radiant
paladins are bold and brash, abhorring stealth and grandly
striding into battle against the forces of darkness.Paladins
of the Oath of Radiance are overwhelmingly good-aligned,
and most are lawful. Some reject the rigid nature of
knightly orders for the life of a knight errant. Though still
nearly universally good, these wayward paladins are more
neutral than lawful, and they use their relative freedom to
bring their light to bear as they deem it necessary.
Paladins who swear the Oath of Radiance devote
themselves to fighting the insidious powers that darken
mortal hearts and against the undead that extinguish the
light of life and replace it with hungry darkness. Most
important, they take it upon themselves to rescue those
corrupted by shadow or undead influence. They will spare
mortal foes held in the thrall of darkness in the hope that
such creatures can be redeemed.
Cleanse Corruption. I will burn out all creatures born of
darkness, showing no pity or mercy. I will not suffer the
company of dark creatures, save those taken in by darkness
whom I might redeem.
Lead with Light. I stand open and courageous in the face
of battle and will be the last of my companions to quit the
field, just as the last ray of sun leaves the day.
Preserve the Righteous. I will defend those who labor and
live in fear of shadow. I will shield them from harm and
keep the light upon them.
Redeem the Beguiled. Those tempted into the service of
darkness may yet be saved, and I will do everything in my
power to bring them back to the light. I will be discerning
in offering this mercy, but the redemption of the corrupted
is paramount.
Remain Pure. I will never yield to the lies of darkness or
suffer corruption to take me. I will cleanse myself of dark
taint or die before threatening those I defend.
You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed.
3rd guiding bolt, protection from evil and good
5th magic weapon, scorching ray
9th beacon of hope, daylight
13th fire shield, inspiring speech*
17th greater restoration, sun's bounty*
* Described in this book
When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following
two Channel Divinity options.
Dawn’s Radiance. As an action, you present your holy
symbol or a melee weapon, and it flares with the radiance
of the newly risen sun. Magical darkness within 20 feet
of you is dispelled. Thereafter, the object continues to
shine for 1 hour or until you lose possession of it. The
object sheds bright light out to 20 feet and dim light for an
additional 20 feet.
An undead creature, a creature native to the plane of
shadow, or any creature harmed by sunlight (such as a
creature with the Sunlight Sensitivity feature) suffers
pain and disorientation when bathed in this radiance. The
creature has disadvantage on attack rolls and on Dexterity
(Stealth) and Wisdom (Perception) checks while it, the
target of its attack, or anything it is trying to perceive is in
the bright light shed by the holy symbol or weapon.
Turn the Corrupted. As an action, you present your
holy symbol and speak a prayer against the corruptive
power of death and shadow, using your Channel Divinity.
Each undead or creature native to the plane of shadow that
is within 30 feet of you and that can see or hear you must
make a successful Wisdom saving throw or be turned for 1
minute or until it takes damage.
Beginning at 7th level, you and your allies within 10 feet
of you have advantage on saving throws against spells and
effects created by undead creatures and by creatures native
to the plane of shadow. This benefit lasts until someone fails
a saving throw that was made with advantage because of
your Aura of Resolve. Once that happens, you must finish a
short or long rest before you can use this feature again.
At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.
Starting at 15th level, you have resistance to necrotic
damage, and your ability scores and hit point maximum
can’t be reduced by any effect.
At 20th level, as an action, you can suffuse your being
with divine radiance that brings life and burns away dark
corruption. For 1 minute, you gain the following benefits:
• At the start of each of your turns, you regain 10 hit
points.
• Once on your turn when you hit an undead creature or
a creature native to the plane of shadow, it must make a
successful Wisdom saving throw against your spell save
DC or be incapacitated until the end of its next turn.
• An undead creature or a creature native to the plane of
shadow that touches you or hits you with a melee attack
from 5 feet away takes 2d8 radiant damage.
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you
finish a long rest.
Paladins who swear the Oath of Thunder are even more
reserved and humble in daily life than other paladins.
That veneer splits like a thunderclap in battle, when they
erupt as vicious hellions. Indeed, thundering paladins
love to strike “thunder-wise,” meaning suddenly and
with surprise, appearing like a bolt of lightning in their
enemies’ midst before those enemies know what hit them.
Paladins of the Oath of Thunder are often devoted to the
cause of good but care little about the struggle between
law and chaos.
The Oath of Thunder stresses moderation and clear
purpose in daily life, along with crushing, decisive
strikes on the battlefield. Paladins sworn to Thunder see
aberrations and fiends as the ultimate forces of corruption
in the world and strive tirelessly to thwart their designs.
Composure Is My Shield. My deeds are my armor, and
I am not easily provoked. If anyone shall insult me, I
shall laugh at their ignorance. If anyone shall insult my
companions, I shall show them their error.
Crush the Abomination. Twisted creatures from beyond
the world have no place in it. Aberrations and fiends will
feel my blade and know death.
Decisiveness in Battle. When the time for words has
passed, I will strike first to bring a swift end to my enemies.
Duty Above All. Though I drink with the gods and laugh
with the valkyries, I will stand my watch. I will defend my
nation. I will defend my companions.
Humility in Life. I am the Thunder’s servant, not its
master. I will live without excess, assured in my own
strength without ostentation. Charity and courage are
twins.
Voice Like Thunder. My voice rings clear and true in
defense of those who can’t speak out for themselves. I will
speak the truth, because such words echo through the ages.
You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed.
3rd heroism, thunderwave
5th find steed, gust of wind
9th call lightning, thunderclap*
13th freedom of movement, stoneskin
17th not this day!*, rain of blades*
* Described in this book
When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain proficiency
in the Stealth skill.
When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following
two Channel Divinity options.
Storm Strike. As an action, you can use your Channel
Divinity to infuse a ranged or thrown weapon you are
holding with the wrath of a storm god. Make a ranged
weapon attack as normal. In addition to the weapon
attack, you create a line of lightning 5 feet wide and 60
feet long that extends from you straight toward the
target. If the target is less than 60 feet from you, the line
of lightning continues beyond it. Each creature in the
line takes lightning damage equal to 2d10 + your paladin
level, or half the damage with a successful Dexterity saving
throw. If your ranged or thrown weapon attack hits, the
target has disadvantage on its saving throw.
Turn the Unclean. As an action, you present your holy
symbol and utter a war cry, using your Channel Divinity.
Each aberration or fiend within 30 feet of you that can see
or hear you must make a successful Wisdom saving throw
or be turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage.
Beginning at 7th level, you and any allies within 10 feet of
you add your proficiency bonus to initiative rolls.
At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.
Starting at 15th level, when your attack hits a creature that
hasn’t yet taken its first turn in this combat, or when you
hit a creature you were hidden from when you attacked,
that creature has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability
checks, and saving throws until the start of your next turn.
At 20th level, you can take on the aspect of the thunder
god. While at rest, you have the gloomy demeanor of a
thundercloud. When you go into action, your clothing
and hair blow wildly in a wind that arises from nowhere,
your eyes flare with lightning, and your voice booms like
thunder.
By using an action, you undergo a transformation. For 1
hour, you gain the following benefits:
• You don’t have disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth)
checks because of armor.
• You have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks and
initiative rolls.
• Your weapon attacks deal an extra 1d10 lightning or
thunder damage (your choice when you hit).
• As an action, you can unleash a terrifying war cry.
Every enemy creature in a 30-foot cone must make a
successful Wisdom saving throw or become frightened
of you for 1 minute. While frightened in this way, the
creature must spend its turn trying to move as far away
from you as it can. It can’t take reactions. On this turn,
the creature can do nothing other than take the Dash
action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it
from moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature
can use the Dodge action. A frightened creature that’s
more than 30 feet from you and can’t see you repeats
the saving throw at the start of its turn, ending the
effect on itself on a success. A creature that succeeds
on its saving throw can’t be affected by your war cry for
24 hours.
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you
finish a long rest.
Ranger
ArchetypesAt 3rd level, a ranger gains the Ranger Archetype feature.
The following options are available to a ranger, in addition
to those in the standard rules.
Elves of the forested woodlands and mountain foothills
often uphold the tradition of taming and riding griffons,
living on the same windswept crags where griffons nest,
thus giving themselves the ability to command vast tracts
of woodland territory. Trained by elf veterans and beast
tamers, rangers of the Griffon Scout archetype learn
to move swiftly and stealthily both on foot and while
mounted, gathering information on their enemies and
mounting devastating hit-and-run raids with precision
and coordination.
Starting at 3rd level, you learn an additional spell when
you reach certain levels, as shown in the Griffon Scout
Spells table. These spells count as ranger spells for you, but
they don’t count against the number of ranger spells you
can know.
3rd feather fall
5th find steed
9th haste
13th greater invisibility
17th telepathic bond
Also starting at 3rd level, you have advantage on Dexterity
(Stealth) checks while mounted, and your Dexterity
(Stealth) checks apply to both you and your mount.
SKIRMISHER’S STEP
Beginning at 3rd level, when you move at least 20 feet
straight toward a creature and hit it with a melee weapon
attack in the same turn, that attack deals an extra 1d8
damage of the same type dealt by the weapon to the target.
If you move out of the target’s reach before the end of your
next turn, whether you are mounted or not, you don’t
provoke an opportunity attack from the target.
Starting at 7th level, you can deliver punishing flurries
of attacks in perfect coordination with your allies. When
one of your allies hits a target within 30 feet of you with
an attack, you can use your reaction to make one weapon
attack against that target.
At 11th level, when you cast find steed, you can choose for
your steed to take the form of a griffon, though it is a fey
instead of a monstrosity.
Starting at 15th level, when you move at least 20 feet
during your turn, whether you are mounted or not, you
become an evasive blur. Until the start of your next turn,
a creature that attacks you has disadvantage on the first
attack roll it makes against you or your mount.
Vampire slayers wander remote forests, haunted hills, and
fog-bound moors, protecting the common folk of farming
villages and cabins at the edge of civilized lands from the
creatures of the night. Moving unseen through woodlands,
your specialized training allows you to hunt vampires,
ghouls, werewolves, and other monsters that prey on the
innocent. Although you are most at home in the wilderness,
as your skills improve, your attention might turn to older
vampires that rule entire baronies, or that command dark
keeps and sprawling manors closer to civilization.
If you choose this archetype at 3rd level, your favored
enemy becomes undead if you did not select undead at 1st
level. When you choose additional favored enemies at 6th
and 14th level, you can choose freely from the standard
list, and you can also select hags or lycanthropes as an
alternative.
HUNTER’S PREY
At 3rd level, you gain one of the following features of your
choice: either Colossus Slayer, Giant Killer, or Horse
Breaker from the Hunter archetype in the standard rules,
or Empowered Strike, which is described below.
Empowered Strike. Your expertise in fighting undead and
lycanthropes allows you to harm them even when you’re
not wielding a magic weapon. When you fight a creature
that has resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing
damage from nonmagical weapons, you can ignore this
resistance once per turn when you score a hit with a
nonmagical weapon. If you are wielding a magic weapon,
the creature takes an extra 1d8 damage from one of your
successful attacks on each of your turns.
At 7th level, you gain one of the following features of your
choice: either Escape the Horde, Multiattack Defense, or
Steel Will from the Hunter archetype in the standard rules,
or Ranger's Resilience, which is described below.
Ranger’s Resilience. You have advantage on saving throws
against paralysis and against effects that would reduce your
hit point maximum.
SLAYER’S STRIKE
At 11th level, you gain one of the following features of your
choice: either Volley or Whirlwind Attack from the Hunter
archetype in the standard rules, or Straight Through the
Heart, which is described below.
Straight Through the Heart. When you use an attack
action, you can choose to make a single melee attack
against a favored enemy in an effort to strike a vulnerable
spot. If the attack hits, it deals an extra 6d6 damage.
SUPERIOR HUNTER’S DEFENSE
At 15th level, you gain one of the following features of your
choice: either Evasion, Stand Against the Tide, or Uncanny
Dodge from the Hunter archetype in the standard rules, or
Greater Resilence, which is described below.
Greater Resilience. You have advantage on saving throws
against the spells and abilities of your favored enemies.
Sorcerous
OriginsAt 1st level, a sorcerer gains the Sorcerous Origin feature.
The following options are available to a sorcerer, in
addition to those in the standard rules.
Your innate magic comes from your superior bloodline.
Your magic wells up from within you, as a paragon of
your race. Whether you come from a long line of storied
ancestors, or you are simply the product of a chance
blending of the best characteristics of your race, you were
born exceptional, and your sorcerous power is a testament
to your legacy.
At 1st level, you have a natural affinity for a particular
school of magic, depending on your race, as shown on
the table below. You can cast a particular spell from
that school without needing material components, and
that bonus spell does not count against your number of
sorcerer spells known. You regain the use of your bonus
spell when you finish a long rest.
Dwarf Transmutation feather fall
Dragonborn Evocation burning hands
Elf Enchantment hideous laughter
Gnome Illusion illusory script
Half-elf Divination identify
Half-orc Necromancy false life
Halfling Abjuration alarm
Human Any one one from chosen school
Tiefling Conjuration floating disk
When your Spellcasting feature lets you learn a new
sorcerer cantrip or a new sorcerer spell of 1st level or
higher, you can choose the new spell from the wizard spell
list, as long as the spell is from your associated school.
Also starting at 1st level, you can absorb a certain amount
of hostile magical energy. You can use this feature as a
reaction when you make a successful saving throw against
a spell of a level that is no higher than your sorcerer level.
When you do so, you absorb the magical energy of the
attack. Instead of being affected by the spell, you regain
a number of expended spell slots equal to the level of the
spell. If you have not used any spell slots for a given level
of spell, this feature does not allow you to gain a slot that
would exceed your normal maximum.
For example, if you are a 3rd-level sorcerer and make a
successful save against a 2nd-level spell, you can regain
two 1st-level spell slots or one 2nd-level spell slot.
If you don’t have two available 1st-level spell slots,
you must regain the 2nd-level slot. If you have
one available 1st-level spell slot and no 2nd-level
slots, you regain one 1st-level slot
when you use this feature.
You can regain a number of expended spell slots equal to
twice your sorcerer level. Once you regain all the expended
slots provided by this feature, you must finish a short or
long rest before you can use the feature again.
Starting at 6th level, you can more easily enhance spells
affiliated with your associated school. If you apply a
Metamagic option to a spell from that school, it costs 1
less sorcery point. If the option normally costs 1 sorcery
point, it costs 1/2 point for you.
At 14th level or higher, you can spend 4 sorcery points to
infuse yourself with power, showing all the elite power
of your bloodline. For 1 minute afterward, you double
your proficiency bonus on any Charisma-based checks
made against others of your race, and you have advantage
on those checks. Any creatures not of your race have
disadvantage on saving throws against spells you cast.
Additionally, you add your Charisma bonus to the damage
of any spells you cast. Once you use this feature, you must
finish a long rest before you can use it again.
Starting at 18th level, you can make one of your spells
more effective if you spend 2 sorcery points when you
cast it. If the spell deals damage, you can roll twice for
damage and use the higher result. If the spell does not deal
damage, the targets of the spell have disadvantage on the
saving throw against it.
Your innate magic arises from elemental power suffused
into your being. You might have an elemental creature,
such as genie, in your ancestry. Perhaps you lived most of
your life near a portal to one of the Elemental Planes, and
the ambient magic of the plane saturated everything you
ate and drank. Perhaps a magical conjuring went awry,
and the essence of an elemental merged with your own.
Whatever the ultimate source, you are a walking conduit
to an elemental plane.
At 1st level, choose one element from the Elemental
Heritage table. You can speak, read, and write the language
associated with your heritage, and its damage type is used
by features you gain later.
Air Auran Lightning or thunder
(choose one)
Earth Terran Bludgeoning
Fire Ignan Fire
Water Aquan Cold
Starting when you choose this origin at 1st level, you are
able to channel your elemental power into a swirling aura.
As a bonus action, you can surround yourself in a magical
aura of elemental material or energy appropriate to your
heritage element for 1 minute. While the aura persists, you
gain the following benefits:
• When you are attacked, you can use your reaction to
impose disadvantage on the attack roll.
• When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher, the aura
around you intensifies until the start of your next turn.
During this time, any creature that ends its turn within
5 feet of you or that enters that area takes 1d6 damage
of the type associated with your heritage element. This
damage increases to 2d6 when you reach 7th level.
You can use this feature twice. You regain all expended
uses when you finish a long rest.
Starting at 6th level, you gain resistance to the damage
type associated with your heritage.
Additionally, when you damage a creature with a spell,
you can spend 1 sorcery point to enhance it with the
power of your heritage element. The spell takes on a visual
cast that reflects the elemental infusion (fire and embers
dance in the area, wind swirls around a bolt of energy,
and so forth) and delivers the following additional effects
depending on your heritage:
• Air. The creature is buffeted by strong winds, arcs of
lighting, and claps of thunder. It can’t take reactions
until the start of its next turn.
• Earth. The creature is restrained until the start of your
next turn.
• Fire. The creature is seared by your fiery magic. It is
frightened until the end of its next turn. Creatures that
are immune to fire are unaffected.
• Water. The creature is disoriented as the world seems
to roll and pitch in waves. It is poisoned until the end of
its next turn.
At 14th level, you can teleport by skimming the outer
boundary of the Elemental Planes. As a bonus action,
you can magically teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied
space you can see. When you appear, you can create one of
the following effects, depending on your heritage element:
• Air. When you appear within 5 feet of an area of wind
(whether natural or magical), you create a cyclonic
burst of wind. All creatures within 10 feet of you must
succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 2d6
slashing damage and be blinded by dust and debris
until the start of your next turn.
• Earth. When you appear within 5 feet of nonmagical,
unworked stone filling at least one 5-foot square,
you create tremors in the earth that ripple outward
from you. Each creature within 10 feet of you that is
touching the ground must succeed on a Strength saving
throw or take 4d6 bludgeoning damage and fall prone.
• Fire. When you appear within 5 feet of a fire at least the
size of a campfire, you create a burst of flame around
yourself. Each creature within 10 feet must succeed on
a Dexterity saving throw or take 2d6 fire damage and
catch on fire. Until a creature takes an action to douse
the fire, a creature on fire takes 1d6 fire damage at the
start of each of its turns.
• Water. When you appear within 5 feet of at least 50
gallons of water, you create a torrent of water that
assails the creatures around you. Each creature within
10 feet of you must succeed on a Constitution saving
throw or take 2d6 bludgeoning damage and choke on
the water that forces its way into the creature’s throat.
A choking creature can’t speak and has disadvantage
on attack rolls and ability checks until the start of your
next turn. Creatures that don’t have to breathe or that
can breathe water aren't subject to choking.
Saving throws against these effects are made against your
spell save DC. You can use this feature twice. You regain all
expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.
At 18th level, you gain immunity to the damage type
associated with your heritage element.
Depending on your elemental heritage, you also gain one
of the following benefits:
• Air. You gain a magical flying speed equal to your
current walking speed. Additionally, during your turn
you can spend 1 sorcery point to become insubstantial
wind and mist. Until the start of your next turn, you
can enter a hostile creature’s space, you can move
through a space as narrow as 1 inch without squeezing,
you are immune to the effects of strong wind, and you
have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing
damage from nonmagical attacks.
• Earth. You gain a burrowing speed equal to your
current walking speed, and you can burrow through
nonmagical, unworked earth and stone. While doing
so, you don’t disturb the material you move through.
Additionally, you can spend 1 sorcery point to become
stony and unyielding until the start of your next turn.
During this time, you have resistance to piercing and
slashing damage, you are immune to poison damage,
and you can’t be petrified or poisoned.
• Fire. Your speed increases by 10 feet. Additionally,
during your turn you can spend 1 sorcery point to
become fiery and insubstantial. Until the start of your
next turn, you can move through a hostile creature’s
space. The first time you enter a creature’s space on a
turn, that creature takes 1d10 fire damage and catches
on fire. Until a creature takes an action to douse the
fire, a creature on fire takes 1d10 fire damage at the
start of each of its turns.
• Water. You gain a swimming speed equal to your
current walking speed, and you can breathe both water
and air. Additionally, during your turn you can spend 1
sorcery point to take on a watery form. Until the start of
your next turn, you can enter a hostile creature’s space
and move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide
without squeezing. When you enter a hostile creature’s
space, the creature must succeed on a Strength saving
throw against your spell save DC or fall prone.
Your magic comes from a god of prophecy and
prognostication who imbued a sliver of their power in
your ancestry. Farseers can trace their power through the
generations to a single, powerful ancestor whose divine
gift gave them access to the webs of fate. Some are plagued
by visions and omens, having no knowledge of their august
lineage. These unfortunate individuals might be driven
to madness and ostracized because of their uncontrolled,
forbidden knowledge. Regardless, the touch of the divine
has forever changed you, and the skeins of fate unravel in
your view.
When you choose this origin at 1st level, the blood of your
ancestors signals your destiny. You gain proficiency in
Insight and History. Your preternatural sense of what is
to come also allows you to sense imminent danger, so you
make initiative rolls with advantage.
Starting at 1st level, you can take the Dodge action as a
bonus action on your turn. You use this feature a number
of times equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum
of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a
short or long rest.
When you reach 6th level, your prophetic insight allows
you to commune with otherworldly powers. By focusing
all your attention on a single yes-or-no question for
1 minute, you can pose that question to the powers
beyond. The entity that responds to your question has
vast knowledge, but it isn’t omniscient; it can predict only
what might happen, not what’s certain to occur. Questions
about the future must be phrased in terms of what’s
possible or plausible to avoid nonanswers. You must finish
a short or long rest before using this feature again.
When you reach 14th level, the skeins of time enshroud
your body, distorting the fabric of reality around you. As
an action, you can expend 3 sorcery points to step out of
sync with the current timeline. You can be seen only as an
indistinct, shimmery outline. Attacks against you are made
with disadvantage, and you have resistance to bludgeoning,
piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical weapons.
Additionally, you can move through other creatures and
solid objects as if they were difficult terrain. If you end your
turn inside a solid object, you take 1d10 force damage and
are expelled into the nearest open space.
The effect lasts for up to 1 minute, provided you maintain
concentration on it as on a spell.
At 18th level, visions of likely futures constantly
weave across your consciousness. You can share that
foreknowledge with your companions. As an action, you
can grant up to five creatures (which can include yourself)
advantage on attack rolls or saving throws—each creature
chooses for itself—for up to 1 minute, provided you
maintain concentration on this effect as on a spell. You
must expend 2 sorcery points per affected creature to
trigger this effect.
Otherworldly
PatronsAt 1st level, a warlock gains the Otherworldly Patron
feature. The following options are available to a warlock,
in addition to those in the standard rules.
You have made a pact with a powerful ruler of geniekind
on one of the Elemental Planes. The Genie Lord’s
concerns encompass a myriad of topics, ranging from
those inscrutable to the mortal mind to those that
are simple and straightforward. Genie lords compete
endlessly against each other, and rivalries between these
elemental rulers can engulf entire nations. They aren’t
above bribing a rival’s mortal agents to switch sides if they
think it will gain them an advantage.
The Genie Lord lets you choose from an expanded list of
spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells
are added to the warlock spell list for you.
1st thunderwave, wind tunnel*
2nd gust of wind, sleet storm
3rd protection from energy, water breathing
4th conjure minor elementals, fire shield
5th creation, wall of stone
* Described in this book
GENIE LORD’S FAVOR
Starting at 1st level, you can speak, read, and write
Primordial. You can understand and be understood by any
creature that speaks Auran, Ignan, Terran, or Aquan.
Additionally, your patron grants you a token that can
absorb elemental power. You gain a magical gemstone
with the following properties:
• You can use the gem as an arcane focus.
• The gem can capture elemental power. When you take
acid, cold, fire, lighting, or thunder damage, you can
choose to transfer some or all of the damage into the
gem instead of taking the damage yourself. The gem
can absorb damage equal to twice your warlock level
+ twice your Charisma modifier. The gem becomes
empty again when you finish a long rest.
• While the gem holds any amount of elemental power,
you can use an action to cause it to shed bright light out
to 20 feet and dim light for an additional
20 feet, to shed dim light out to 5 feet, or to
douse the light.
If you lose your token, you can perform
a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement
from your patron. This ceremony can be
performed during a short or long rest, and it
destroys the previous token. Your token shatters to
slivers when you die.
Starting at 6th level, you can use the energy stored in your
token against foes. When you damage a target with any
kind of attack, you can spend stored points to deal extra
damage of the same type equal to your Charisma bonus.
If you deal damage to multiple targets with a single attack,
choose which one takes the extra damage.
Additionally, you can extend the protection of your gem
to other creatures. When an ally within 30 feet that you
can see takes acid, cold, fire, lighting, or thunder damage,
you can use your reaction to transfer some of the damage
into your gem.
Starting at 10th level, you can call upon your Genie Lord
to twist fate in your favor. Immediately after you make an
attack roll, saving throw, ability check, or damage roll, you
can choose to reroll and take the better result.
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you
finish a short or long rest.
HERALD’S ASPECT
Starting at 14th level, you can channel the power of your
patron into your flesh to magically transform into a herald
of your Genie Lord. Your legs fade away into a swirl of
elemental energy, and your skin and features take on a cast
that resembles that of your patron. You can transform as
a bonus action, and the transformation lasts for 1 minute,
during which you gain the following benefits:
• You gain a flying speed of 60 feet.
• You have advantage on saving throws against spells and
other magical effects.
• Choose one of the following damage types: acid, cold,
fire, lightning, or thunder. You gain immunity to that
damage type.
• Once on your turn when you hit with any attack, you
can deal an extra 3d6 damage of one of the following
types: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder.
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you
finish a short or long rest.
THE GENIE LORD'S PACT BOONS
The pact boons bestowed by the Genie Lord are modified
or augmented as described below. Add these details to
whichever pact boon you select.
Your pact weapon takes on a sheen of elemental power.
When you create or summon your pact weapon, you can
choose its damage type to be one of the following: acid,
cold, fire, lightning, or thunder. You can select a different
damage type each time you create the weapon.
When you conjure your familiar or change its form, you
can choose the form of a mephit in addition to the usual
alternatives. When you use your action to command your
mephit familiar to attack, it can use its breath or its Innate
Spellcasting if you so desire.
Your book is immune to damage or wear caused by the
elements. This includes acid, cold, fire, lightning, or
thunder damage, as well as simple effects such as being
immersed in water or set aflame.
You have made a pact with the Sibyl, a divine being
associated with prophecy, knowledge, and fate. Your
patron guides you through visions, portents, and periods
of ecstatic clarity to act on its behalf and to further its
stratagems. Your relationship to your patron is different
from that of its clergy. You are not asked for faith, worship,
or adulation; instead, you serve solely through your
actions and influence in the world. Because of that, you
might have a strained relationship with the deity’s most
dedicated priests and other zealots.
The Sibyl lets you choose from an expanded list of spells
when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are
added to the warlock spell list for you.
1st alarm, seer’s reaction*
2nd augury, blindness /deafness
3rd bestow curse, clairvoyance
4th confusion, divination
5th eidetic memory*, legend lore
* Described in this book
Starting at 1st level, you are driven to ecstatic gibbering
and utterances because of your connection to your
patron. Your prophetic commentary, startling insights,
and frenetic appearance are unsettling, distracting,
and psychically damaging to your target. Although the
manifestation is different, this effect functions the same as
the vicious mockery cantrip.
Additionally, you have proficiency in Performance, and
your proficiency bonus is doubled on ability checks you
make using that skill.
Starting at 6th level, you can direct your patron to
infiltrate and overwhelm your target’s psyche with
knowledge of failures in the target’s immediate future. As
an action, designate a creature within 60 feet that can see
and hear you. It must make a successful Charisma saving
throw or be stunned until the end of your next turn.
After using this feature, you can’t use it again until you
finish a short or long rest.
When you reach 10th level, the voices in your mind become
clearer and more focused. They bolster your mindfulness of
your surroundings and grant you a preternatural awareness
of creatures that mean you harm. While you are wearing
light armor or no armor, you can add your Charisma
modifier (minimum of 1) to your Armor Class.
Starting at 14th level, when you deal psychic damage
to a target, you can also inundate it with frenetic and
discordant voices of doom. The awful truths revealed to
the target cause it to take an extra 8d10 psychic damage,
and it is affected as if by a confusion spell until the end of its
next turn.
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you
finish a long rest.
THE SIBYL'S PACT BOONS
The pact boons bestowed by the Sybil are modified or
augmented as described below. Add these details to
whichever pact boon you select.
Your weapon is usually, but not always, the weapon
favored by your patron. When you create or summon your
pact weapon, you can choose whether it deals damage of
its usual type or psychic damage.
Your patron grants you a special familiar, a giant moth
(Creature Codex, p. 178), to aid you.
Your tome is an illuminated manuscript with depictions of
prophets foretelling events to come. As your adventuring
career progresses, new illuminations appear in the book’s
pages, recording your notable acts in the service of your
patron. While this book is on your person, your passive
Perception score is increased by 1 when being contested by
an enemy's Stealth check.
Arcane
TraditionAt 2nd level, a wizard gains the Arcane Tradition feature.
The following options are available to a wizard, in addition
to the options in the standard rules.
You concentrate your arcane studies on the power
inherent to one of the Elemental Planes.
Elementalists believe in the superiority of their chosen
element above all others, and they aren’t shy about making
that fact known. Elementalists are sometimes secluded
researchers, but more often they’re adventurous types
who sign on with groups that can appreciate their singular
talents.
Beginning when you select this specialty at 2nd level,
choose one element from the table below. That element
becomes the focus of your study. You can speak, read, and
write the language associated with your focus element,
and the associated damage type is used by other features
as noted.
Air Auran Lightning or thunder
(choose one)
Earth Terran Bludgeoning
Fire Ignan Fire
Water Aquan Cold
Some spells are associated with your focus element. The
gold and time you must spend to copy a spell associated
with your chosen element into your spellbook is halved.
The spell list for each focus element is given below. Spells
marked with an asterisk appear in this book.
FOCUS ELEMENT: AIR

6th level—drown*, freezing sphere, wall of ice
* Described in this book
Starting at 2nd level, you learn techniques called masteries
to channel elemental magic into your being and your spells.
Masteries. You learn two masteries of your choice,
which are detailed under “Masteries” below. You learn one
additional mastery of your choice at 6th, 10th, and 14th
levels. Each time you learn a new mastery, you can also
replace one mastery you know with a different one.
Beginning at 6th level, you can funnel elemental essence
through your damage-dealing spells. When you cast a spell
that deals damage, you can change the damage to the type
associated with your focus element.
Starting at 10th level, when you would take damage of
the type associated with your focus element, you can use
a reaction to take no damage and regain a number of hit
points equal to half the damage you would have taken. You
can use this feature even if you have resistance or immunity
to that damage type from another source. You can use
this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence
modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses
when you finish a long rest.
At 14th level, your elemental damage spells are
unstoppable. Your spells that deal damage of the type
associated with your focus element ignore immunity to that
damage type. You can use this feature a number of times
equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once). You
regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
Masteries are specialized techniques you can use to
augment your spellcasting. Unless noted otherwise, you
can use only one mastery on a given spell. The masteries are
presented in alphabetical order.
Prerequisite: 14th level
You add plane shift to your spellbook if you don’t already
have it, and you can cast it once with this mastery without
expending a spell slot. You can travel only to the elemental
plane associated with your focus element, or to the
Material Plane. While you are on the elemental plane,
you aren’t harmed by the normal conditions of the plane,
you can breathe normally, and you can use your speed to
move in a manner appropriate to the plane (flying for air,
burrowing for earth, and swimming for water). You regain
the ability to cast plane shift with this mastery when you
finish a long rest.
Prerequisite: 10th level
You add planar binding to your spellbook if you don’t
already have it, and you can cast it once with this mastery
without expending a spell slot. When you cast the spell in
this way, you must target an elemental creature associated
with your focus element. If the elemental fails its saving
throw, it gains temporary hit points equal to your wizard
level. You regain the ability to cast planar binding with this
mastery when you finish a long rest.
Prerequisite: 6th level
You gain resistance to the damage type associated
with your focus element, and you have advantage
on Constitution saving throws made to maintain
concentration on spells that involve your focus element.
As an action, you can charm an elemental creature for as
long as you maintain concentration as if concentrating on
a spell, for up to 1 hour. If you or your companions damage
the charmed elemental or take any harmful action against
it, the charmed condition ends immediately. When this
condition ends for a given elemental, it is immune to being
charmed by you for 24 hours.
Prerequisite: 10th level
After you damage a target with a spell that deals the
damage type associated with your focus element, the target
gains vulnerability to that damage type until the end of
your next turn. You can use this feature twice. You regain
all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.
Prerequisite: Elemental focus (fire)
When you deal fire damage to a target with a spell of
1st level or higher, you can use a bonus action to cause
the target to catch fire. At the start of its next turn, the
creature takes half as much fire damage as it originally
took from the spell, and the flames go out. This damage
can be prevented if an ally within 5 feet uses an action to
put out the flames. If you damage more than one target
with the spell, choose just one to catch fire.
Prerequisite: 14th level
When you damage a creature with a spell of 1st level or
higher that deals the damage type associated with your
focus element, you can weave a lingering aura of elemental
energy around the target. At the start of its turn, the
creature must make a Constitution saving throw. On a
failed save, it takes 4d6 damage of the type dealt by the
spell and is stunned until the start of its next turn. On a
successful save, it takes half the damage and the effect ends.
You can use this feature twice. You regain all expended
uses when you finish a short or long rest.
Prerequisite: Elemental focus (earth)
When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher, you can use
a bonus action to create a hovering slab of stone that
interposes itself between you and one creature of your
choice within 60 feet. Until the end of your next turn, the
slab provides half cover to you against attacks from the
chosen creature.
Prerequisite: Elemental focus (water)
When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher, you can use
a bonus action to create a sweeping wave of water that
drenches a target you can see within 20 feet. The creature
must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed 5
feet in the direction of your choice.
Prerequisite: Elemental focus (air)
When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher, you can use
a bonus action to create a line of wind 20 feet long and 5
feet wide. Each creature in the line must make a successful
Strength saving throw or take 1d6 slashing damage and be
pushed 10 feet away from you in the direction of the line.
An enlightened few wizards know that true mastery of life
and death requires understanding of the uneasy balance
between life, death, and undeath—the necromantic triad.
You don’t walk the same path as traditional
users of necromantic magic, which your
order refers to as “dark necromancers.”
You have profound respect for life’s
eternal cycle and use the power you have
accumulated to honor the dead and aid
the living.
Restriction: Non-Evil. You can choose
this wizard specialty only if you have an
alignment that isn’t evil.
Beginning when you select this specialty at 2nd level, the
gold and time you must spend to copy a necromancy spell
into your spellbook is halved.
At 2nd level, you gain proficiency in Medicine and
Religion if you don’t already have it, your proficiency
bonus is doubled for Wisdom (Medicine) checks, and
you have advantage on Intelligence (Religion) checks to
recall lore about deities of death, burial practices, and the
afterlife. In addition, you learn the spare the dying cantrip,
which is a wizard cantrip for you and doesn’t count against
the number of wizard cantrips you know.
Also starting at 2nd level,
you can use an action to
heal a creature you can
touch. The creature
regains hit points equal
to your Intelligence
modifier + your wizard level
(minimum of 1). This feature can restore a creature to no
more than half its hit point maximum. Once a creature has
regained hit points from this feature, it can’t do so again
until it finishes a long rest.
At 6th level, you add the animate dead spell to your
spellbook if it is not there already. When you cast this spell,
it has additional effects:
• If the undead creature has an Intelligence score of 5
or lower, its Intelligence becomes 6, and it gains the
ability to understand and speak one language of your
choice that you speak.
• The undead creature’s alignment is the same as yours.
• At the end of the undead creature’s first 24 hours of
serving you, it might continue to serve you for another
24 hours or else return to its eternal rest. You can
convince the undead creature to continue serving you
with a successful Charisma (Persuasion) check against
a DC equal to 8 + the creature’s challenge rating. On
a successful check, the creature remains under your
control, and the DC of the next check you make to
maintain control 24 hours later increases by 1. You have
disadvantage on this check if you were disrespectful to
the creature in the previous 24 hours. On a failed check,
or if you choose not to maintain control, the undead
creature immediately crumbles to dust.
When you reach 11th level, you add the create undead
spell to your spellbook. All of the above effects also apply
whenever you cast that spell.
At 10th level, you add the warding bond spell to your
spellbook, and it is a wizard spell for you. You can cast
warding bond without expending a spell slot or requiring
the material component, and the spell’s duration increases
to 4 hours.
Once you cast warding bond in this way, you can’t do so
again until you finish a long rest. You can still cast warding
bond normally using an available spell slot.
Once you reach 14th level, you can use an action to cause
life-preserving magic to emit from you. When you do
so, you and friendly creatures within 20 feet of you have
resistance to necrotic damage for 1 minute. In addition,
each creature affected by your use of Protect Life has
advantage on saving throws against spells and effects that
reduce its hit point maximum, such as a specter’s Life
Drain or the harm spell.
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you
finish a short or long rest.
BACKGROUNDSMany people come of age after being exposed to some
form of arcane magic, or after being attracted to the study
of supernatural forces. The arcane backgrounds presented
below are examples of how to expand the concept, all
designed to give players a wider range of choices when
fleshing out their characters if the GM allows this material
into the campaign. Optionally, the GM can use these
backgrounds to add depth and complexity to NPCs that
the player characters will come up against.
Some of your earliest memories are of the library you
called home while you learned to read and write under
the tutelage of your mentor. The stacks comforted you,
protected you, and took you to lands undreamed of. Now
the time has come to turn that knowledge into practical
experience, and to record your own journey for posterity.
Skill Proficiencies: Arcana, Investigation
Tool Proficiencies: Artisan’s tools (calligrapher’s supplies)
Languages: Two of your choice
Equipment: A leather-bound journal full of notes from
past research projects, a set of robes, calligrapher’s
supplies, 5 sheets of loose paper, a pair of spectacles, and a
pouch containing 15 gp
FEATURE:
Your familiarity with libraries and the tomes contained
in them is unmatched. If you spend 1 hour studying the
available books, grimoires, and codices in an archive,
library, or similar collection while researching a specific
subject, you can treat any Intelligence-based check result
related to that subject of 9 or lower as a 10. Once you use
this feature, you can’t use it again to research the same
subject in the same library.
Arcane archivists are most at home in their libraries.
Their personalities and motivations reflect their focus,
sometimes obsessive, on recorded knowledge and the
search for it. Their motives for pursuing a life as an
archivist are rarely so straightforward.
D
1 There is nothing more important than knowledge. It
is neither good nor bad. To suggest otherwise is to be
closed in mind and thought.
2 I would rather spend time with my nose in a book. I
find interacting with people discomfiting.
3 I am fascinated by a specific area of esoteric
knowledge. If I find someone who shares
that interest, we might become fast friends.
4 My mind is my sanctum. I neglect the needs
of my body as secondary, often forgoing
meals and bathing, when I’m lost in
contemplation and study.
5 I am an observer and chronicler of the
journeys, experiences, trials, and tribulations
of my companions as viewed from the
outside looking in.
6 The path to knowledge is not solely traversed
through books and study. To fully learn, you
must experience!
7 I find the blind faith of religions, cults, and
their ilk perturbing, and I ask endless questions
of those who profess such beliefs.
8 Because I believe that a sound body is essential
for a clear intellect, I relish physical activity
and exercise.
D
1 Purity. The truth of a matter is subject to the whims
of the historian. Facts are pure and incontrovertible.
(Any)
2 Focus. Precision and concentration: These are the
keys to successful completion of my objectives.
(Lawful)
3 Objectivity. Action and inaction have consequences
far beyond the immediate future. The appearance
of one morality does not preclude the emergence of
another as time goes on. (Neutral)
4 Objectification. I use resources—including
companions, allies, and bystanders—as I need them
to further my ends. (Evil)
5 Preservation. Life is knowledge, and knowledge is
life. Preserving life in all its forms is paramount to a
civilized culture. (Good)
6 Observation. I will participate only as a last resort.
Events, to be true and accurate, must unfold without
interference. (Neutral)
Years, possibly centuries, ago you were captured by the
fey. Each host, as the fey called themselves, treated their
“guest” differently. The relationship you forged with your
captors defines you just as strongly as the circumstances
of your abduction and of your escape or release. You have
been indelibly marked—emotionally, psychically, and
physically—by the fey and their special brand of hospitality.
Skill Proficiencies: Deception, Insight
Tool Proficiencies: One type of gaming set, one type of
musical instrument
Languages: Elvish, Sylvan
Equipment: A flower with petals that will never wilt,
a musical instrument (one of your choice), a set of fine
clothes, and a pouch containing 10 gp
LIFE-CHANGING EVENT
The fey have a multitude of reasons for abducting—or
rescuing—folk like you, and it’s also possible that you
or others did something to bring about your situation.
Choose or randomly determine the reason behind your
sojourn in the realm of the fey.
D
1 I always keep a journal. It grounds me to my past and
organizes my thoughts. Without it, I would be lost.
2 I carefully consider my options before making any
decision of importance.
3 I am a student—in thoughts, actions, and words—
ahead of all other roles and responsibilities.
4 A quill, given to me be my mentor during our first
lessons, is precious to me above all other things.
5 I am bound to fulfill a sacred duty to a university or a
tutor that started me on my path.
6 I stole a priceless grimoire from my patron, and they
have learned of my theft.
D
1 I am protective of all that I have learned. I have
sacrificed much for it, and it is mine to do with as I
please.
2 I have found the one true way, the path to
enlightenment. I share my teachings with all who can
hear me, whether they want to follow the path or not.
3 I place my safety ahead of the welfare of all others.
How else will my knowledge be recorded and shared
with future generations?
4 I was once confined in a prison of my own making.
Never again will I limit myself to learning without
experiencing.
5 I will not destroy a book, tome, grimoire, or text of
any kind. To lose knowledge is an abomination.
6 I share the knowledge I have worked so hard to attain
with all who seek it. A question asked is a question
that deserves to be answered.
D
1 My childhood was tithed to the fey by my family in
return for prosperity for as long I remained in their
care.
2 I made a bargain with a fox to play with its cubs in
their den. The fox turned out to be an emissary of the
Summer Court, and I was not released until the cubs
came of age.
3 Centuries ago my ancestors were rulers and made a
political alliance with the fey in exchange for tribute
to be paid every third generation. We are no longer
rulers, but the fey still demand their tithe.
4 I have no memories of my past before I was taken by
the fey.
5 I wandered into an ancient, primeval wood shortly
after learning to walk and was found by the fey, who
took me in.
6 A fey child befriended me and invited me to their
home.
7 I am the only survivor of a fey raid. They killed my
parents, but spared me for their own unknowable
reasons.
8 My parents could not care for me, and their choices
were to abandon me in a forest or a city. They chose
the forest.
D
1 I left a friend behind when I escaped, and I am
gathering resources to return and free them.
2 I did not escape from my fey captors. They allowed me
my freedom in exchange for my continued clandestine
service.
3 I earned my freedom by tricking another to take my
place with the fey. My betrayal of that person’s trust
haunts me.
4 I am free because of the actions of an unknown
benefactor. I wait for them to reveal why I was
released.
5 I feel a constant, ever-tugging connection to the lands
of the fey.
6 I was given my freedom after years of diligent,
demeaning, and debauched servitude.
D
1 I cannot lie outright, only by omission, because of my
years with the fey.
2 I will never willingly make another promise to anyone
or anything.
3 The fey creature that abducted me haunts me in my
dreams.
4 I will never accept free food, drink, or gifts from
strangers.
5 I speak in sing-song voice and in rhymes.
I never answer questions directly.
6 I am certain that my freedom from the fey is only
temporary and that any fey I meet want to recapture
me.
D
1 Art. Works of art are meant to question, challenge,
and disturb. (Any)
2 Pleasure. There are no long-term rewards, only the
enjoyments of the moment. (Chaotic)
3 Independence. Independence is the privilege of the
few who are strong to assert it. (Any)
4 Fellowship. Lasting fellowship is born in shared
suffering and teamwork when overcoming adversity.
(Any)
5 Self-confidence. There are no views, perspectives, or
standards of any worth aside from my own. (Evil)
6 Malice. I feel nothing but spite, rancor, and envy for
those that took me, and for those that let me be taken.
(Evil)
D
1 I remain a child in thought, action, and deed.
2 I defer decisions to elves and fey that I encounter,
always looking to them for guidance.
3 I long for the accommodations and sustenance I
became accustomed to as a hostage of the Fair Folk.
4 I distrust any who display traits of fey heritage.
5 I tell others what I think they want to hear, whether I
believe it not, to keep them happy.
6 I see danger in every shadow, enemies behind each
door, and threats in the eyes of strangers.
7 I never speak unless spoken to, and never look people
in the eyes.
8 I am fascinated, frightened, and uncomfortable in an
urban environment.
FEATURE: FIRST IMPRESSIONS
You were raised in a situation in which failing to
adhere to the nuances, niceties, and intrigues of the fey
court could have catastrophic repercussions. The first
impressions one makes set the tone for future endeavors.
You have learned that lesson well, and continue to apply
it. In your initial social interaction with an individual
fey, you gain a +2 bonus to the first Charisma-based
check you make.
A fey hostage will never forget the events that led to
their capture, the treatment they experienced,
or the circumstances of their release. Their
experiences with the unpredictable fey might
range from whimsical to pathological.
A quirk of fate, or a circumstance of birth, exposed you to
the intoxicating power of arcane magic and changed you
irrevocably. You spent your formative years learning about
yourself, gauging your inner reserves and how much you
are willing to sacrifice to achieve your goals.
Skill Proficiencies: Arcana and either Persuasion
or Intimidation
Tool Proficiencies: Artisan’s tools
(alchemist’s supplies), poisoner’s kit
Languages: Infernal or Abyssal
Equipment: A set of alchemist’s supplies, a
pocket knife, a piece of chalk connected to a string,
a chapbook of esoteric symbols, a set of common clothes,
and a pouch containing 10 gp
FEATURE: CHANNEL ESSENCE
You can call upon your inner reserves to recover from
debilitating, long-term injuries. As part of a short rest,
you can offset a reduction to one of your ability scores
by expending a number of Hit Dice equal to twice the
amount of the reduction that you want to negate. When
used in this manner, the Hit Dice do not confer other
benefits, such as additional hit points.
Soul channelers are drawn to the dark arts and the
manipulation of available resources to achieve their goals.
For some this might include using their own capabilities,
but an easier (and more common) method employs
summoned creatures, undead servants, and duped
allies. Not every soul channeler chooses to exploit such
opportunities, but the temptation is there for all.
D
1 I realize that gaining power comes at a cost, and I am
prepared to pay that cost, whatever it is.
2 My companions are useful for the abilities they
contribute and the protection they provide me.
3 I am comfortable in places where the dead are
gathered. I find solace and strength in the crypts,
graveyards, and necropolises of the land.
4 I loathe any who profess faith, duty, and devotion
to an entity or a cause without ensuring they will be
compensated for their service.
5 I care nothing for the suffering, pain, and plight of
others. Their concerns are not mine.
6 I will sacrifice my possessions, my needs, and my
well-being for my trusted companions.
7 I detest myself for the depths of depravity I have
plumbed to gain the power I now wield.
8 I mistrust any who have power over me or others.
D
1 My spellcasting focus is a trinket I created. I cannot
live without it.
2 My self-sufficiency provides me with comfort and
confidence.
3 I am searching for an ancient text of esoteric, arcane
knowledge. I try to make decisions and take actions
that lead me to this goal.
4 I take advantage of any opportunities that crop up,
regardless of the possible consequences.
5 I seek to harness living energies from plants, animals,
and the magical world. I wish to see beyond flesh to
the soul itself. All life is in my charge.
6 My loyalty is hard-won, but once earned it is
unwavering.
D
1 I consider my companions and all those I meet as
resources to be used and advantages to be gained.
2 I have no regard for my physical form. It is a tool and a
source of energy, nothing more.
3 I prefer the company of gregarious, ebullient, and
vociferous folk. They lift my somber spirits.
4 The easiest way is always the best way.
5 I allow myself to be driven by impulses. My first
inclination is the course of action I pursue.
6 I distrust all who rely on fickle deities and unknowable
patrons to acquire their spells, influence, and power.
D
1 Will. Embarking on the pursuit of greatness is not
enough. I must have the will to do what others shy
away from in order to accomplish my goals. (Any)
2 Sacrifice. I believe that sacrifice—personal,
emotional, or otherwise—is necessary to achieve
greatness. (Any)
3 Abstinence. I cleanse myself of distractions to
achieve purity of purpose. (Lawful)
4 Deception. I never tell the whole truth, even if there
is no apparent need to lie. The truth has been used
against me too many times. (Evil)
5 Lunacy. I embrace the turmoil in my mind and soul
that comes with manipulating eldritch energies.
(Chaotic)
6 Diabolic. I inflict pain, suffering, and strife with zeal
and gusto. (Evil)
Your connection to magic began with a term of service,
or servitude, to a magician of power. Your partnership
continued as expected for years, until the bond was
abruptly broken. In the aftermath, you found yourself with
a new body. Despite your new appearance, your actions
often betray your origin. The struggle between what you
have become and what you once were rages within you.
Skill Proficiencies: Perception, Survival
Tool Proficiencies: Artisan’s tools (alchemist’s kit)
Languages: One of your choice
Equipment: A trinket worn or carried by your previous
form, a set of traveler’s clothes, an alchemist’s kit, an
explorer’s pack, and a pouch containing 5 gp
LIFE-CHANGING EVENT
You were previously a different kind of creature. How you
became what you are, and what you know of your former
existence, can vary greatly depending on the circumstances.
Choose or randomly determine the life-changing event that
brought about your transformation.
D
1 My bond was severed and my form irrevocably changed
in a surge of wild, uncontrolled magic that claimed the
life of the mage who called me their familiar.
2 The Pact of the Chain between my warlock and myself
was dissolved unexpectedly with their passing. Their
patron, not wanting to lose two advocates, granted me
my current form as a reward for services rendered, and
expects me to continue their works.
3 My service to, and partnership with, a mage of
great power and cunning was rewarded with
transmogrification into my new body.
4 I awoke in an unfamiliar body, with only dream-like
memories of my prior service to a being of great
arcane ability.
5 I broke my bond with my master, replacing it with a
pledge of service to a higher power. Part of the bargain
was providing me with a new form to more easily hide
from my past.
6 I stood by my master’s side as aide, ally, and advisor
until an unknown enemy severed our connection,
robbed me of my true body, and captured my master.
7 My master, infirm with age and senility,
unintentionally released me and altered my body in an
attempt to rejuvenate themselves.
8 I betrayed my master in a time of crisis, and their last
act was to transform me into my current form, robbing
me of my natural body forever.
FEATURE: FAMILIAR INSIGHT
You are a transformed familiar, and although your physical
form has changed, you will never forsake the instincts
and insights you were born with. When interacting with
creatures of your original type, you have a +2 bonus on
Wisdom (Insight) checks to detect their motives and the
veracity of their claims.
Transformed familiars often display personality traits and
quirks that are holdovers from their prior lives. They might
hold to these affectations consciously, or without realizing
their behavior is unusual. Either way, every transformed
familiar carries their past with them in some manner.
D
1 I am still friendly and even loyal to arcane casters,
especially wizards.
2 I swear no oaths and make no promises to anyone
else. I stand alone.
3 I loathe slavery and enchantments, and work to free
those trapped by chains or magic.
4 I have not forgot my former master, and I continue to
honor my pledge to them.
5 I prefer to serve, aid, and protect my allies and friends.
6 I dislike disguises or changing my form further; I
want the world to see me as I now am.
D
1 I prefer to sleep in the same fashion that I rested when
I was a familiar.
2 Transmutation magic of all kinds frightens me to the
core. I will not willingly use it or have it used on me.
3 In my heart of hearts, I long for the life I left behind.
4 I sometimes speak in the language of my old form, or
forget the speech of humanoids.
5 I still prefer the foods of my prior form, and
sometimes refuse the foods commonly consumed by
my new one.
6 Life was easier as a familiar, and I am wistful about
those bygone times.
D
1 Loyalty. Remaining steadfast when there are no
witnesses to see it or accolades to celebrate it is the
measure of a person. (Any)
2 Service. The path to enlightenment lies in serving a
greater cause. (Any)
3 Freedom. Better to die free than to live in chains.
(Chaotic)
4 Duty. A pact, entered into freely, can never be taken
back and must be fulfilled. (Lawful).
5 Atonement. It is my lot in my new life to make up for
the failings in my first one. (Good)
6 Family. My family is my port in the storm and my
refuge from the world. (Any)
D
1 I am fiercely independent, and do not form strong
emotional connections to others.
2 I seek the advice and guidance of others before
acting.
3 I continue to behave as if I’m in my original body.
4 I am lost in social situations, and the behaviors
expected of me confound me.
5 I punctuate my exclamations with a subtle growl of
emphasis.
6 I keep my own counsel, sharing my thoughts
reluctantly, if at all.
7 I am fascinated by seeing familiar places through the
eyes of my new body.
8 I react instinctually to stress, problems, and
challenges. My gut reaction is the right one.
combine their understanding of alchemical reagents and
elixirs with their knowledge of spellcraft to create new and
formidable magical effects.
Even more than this, though, alkemancy embodies a
unique philosophy of life and nature. Alkemancers don’t
concoct useful potions and philters as an end in itself.
Ultimately, they seek to expand their minds past mortal
limits, or even to achieve true immortality, and alkemancy
is simply the path they follow in pursuit of that goal.
Transmuters and alkemancers belong to similar schools
of thought. But where transmuters have little use for
alchemy and its secrets, preferring to rely on brute magical
force to achieve their aims—at least, that’s the opinion held
by traditional alchemists—alkemancers combine extensive
knowledge of alchemy with the many ways that the six
fundamental essences can be applied to arcane magic.
Too many arcane spellcasters and scholars view alchemy
as magic’s poor second cousin—an academic pursuit with
practical applications, but still nothing that wizards with
real talent would devote serious time or effort to. While
alchemy can achieve astounding, even nearly miraculous
feats, it’s always been overshadowed by the power and
versatility of arcane magic. Because alchemy requires
extensive preparation and forethought, adventurers tend
to prefer the flexibility and immediacy of spellcasting.
In some areas, a branch of alchemy is practiced that
surpasses the simple alchemy familiar to the rest of the
world. Known as magical chemistry, or simply alkemancy,
this discipline delves into the properties of common
alchemical substances, such as brimstone and salt, and
the means by which they can be used to achieve physical
and metaphysical transformation in objects and creatures
on levels unseen in most lands. Alkemancy practitioners
Alkemancy Magic
Magic in
All ThingsThe power of alkemancy resides within the six
fundamental essences: brimstone, lead, quicksilver,
quintessence, salt, and void salt. These essences parallel the
four standard elements, as well as the two more esoteric
elements of metal and void, but are unique to alchemy.
Brimstone. The yellow of brimstone (otherwise known
as sulfur) represents activity, energy, and masculinity,
and it’s related to the sun, volcanoes, and elemental
fire. Brimstone is a destructive essence present in small
amounts in explosives, various acids, and in substances
such as alchemist’s fire.
Lead. Also erroneously referred to as antimony (a
different metal that lead is sometimes combined with),
lead represents coldness and heaviness, transformation,
and the removal of impurities in objects and creatures. It
is associated with broader elemental metals and is often
called the oldest or first metal. Lead is reactive and can be
toxic in various forms over long periods of exposure—
useful qualities in lingering poisons and slow-acting
corrosives. It’s used as a component in many alchemical
creations and supplies.
Quicksilver. Also known as mercury, this silvery metal
represents passivity, femininity, and malleability. It’s
associated with elemental water and the moon. Quicksilver
is seen as a creative essence despite its passive nature.
It’s also a lethal poison, much faster-acting than lead, for
example. A fluid dram of refined quicksilver is occasionally
used in vials of both alchemical poisons and antitoxins.
Quintessence. One of the rarest and most mysterious of
the six fundamental essences, quintessence represents
thought, life, and spirit. It is distantly related to elemental
air; in its commonest form, it appears as a vaporous,
silvery liquid. Quintessence is never used in common
alchemical items, largely because it’s one of the most
difficult of the essences to obtain and it dissipates as soon
as it’s exposed to air. Alkemancers are always keen to find
viable substitutes for quintessence in their concoctions.
Salt. The most common of the six fundamental essences
is salt, which represents matter, physicality, and the human
body. It is closely related to elemental earth. Purified salt
is used in many common alchemical items, and solutions
of salt are used widely in mundane and supernatural
formulas and rituals.
Void Salt. Dull black crystals distilled from the blood of
slain creatures of the Void, the substance known as Void
salt takes its name from its granular appearance. Void salt
is associated with dissolution, entropy, and madness. It
is a dangerous substance to work with, because merely
touching it with bare skin deals 1 necrotic damage. Anyone
intending to work with Void salt should wear gloves of
metal or thick leather, and even those substances corrode
soon after coming in contact with Void salt unless they’re
protected with an anti-necrotic energy coating. The use
of Void salt is reserved for rare alchemical concoctions,
mainly acids, poisons, and explosives.
Most alkemancy spells reside on the wizard spell list. The
sorcerer and the warlock also have access to a smattering
of alkemancy magic.

=== SPELL START ===
Name: ACID GATE
Level: 7
School: Conjuration
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S, M (a vial of acid and a polished silver
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Description:
mirror worth 125 gp)
You create a portal of swirling, acidic green vapor in an
unoccupied space you can see. This portal connects with a
target destination within 100 miles that you are personally
familiar with and have seen with your own eyes, such as
your wizard’s tower or an inn you have stayed at. You and
up to three creatures of your choice can enter the portal
and pass through it, arriving at the target destination
(or within 10 feet of it, if it is currently occupied). If the
target destination doesn’t exist or is inaccessible, the spell
automatically fails and the gate doesn’t form.
Any creature that tries to move through the gate, other
than those selected by you when the spell was cast, takes
10d6 acid damage and is teleported 1d100 × 10 feet in
a random, horizontal direction. If the creature makes a
successful Intelligence saving throw, it can’t be teleported
by this portal, but it still takes acid damage when it enters
the acid-filled portal and every time it ends its turn in
contact with it.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell
slot of 8th level or higher, you can allow one additional
creature to use the gate for each slot level above 7th.
=== SPELL END ===

=== SPELL START ===
Name: ACID RAIN
Level: 5
School: Conjuration
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 150 feet
Components: V, S, M (a drop of acid)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Description:
You unleash a storm of swirling acid in a cylinder 20 feet
wide and 30 feet high, centered on a point you can see. The
area is heavily obscured by the driving acidfall. A creature
that starts its turn in the area or that enters the area for
the first time on its turn takes 6d6 acid damage, or half
as much damage if it makes a successful Dexterity saving
throw. A creature takes half as much damage from the acid
(as if it had made a successful saving throw) at the start of
its first turn after leaving the affected area.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage increases by
1d6 for each slot level above 5th.
=== SPELL END ===

=== SPELL START ===
Name: ALCHEMICAL FORM
Level: 6
School: Transmutation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self
Components: V, S, M (a vial of acid, poison, or
Duration: 1 minute
Description:
alchemist's fire)
You transform into an amoebic form composed of highly
acidic and poisonous alchemical jelly. While in this form:
• you are immune to acid and poison damage and to the
poisoned and stunned conditions;
• you have resistance to nonmagical fire, piercing, and
slashing damage;
• you can’t speak, cast spells, use items or weapons, or
manipulate objects;
• your gear melds into your body and reappears when the
spell ends;
• you don't need to breathe;
• your speed is 20 feet;
• your size doesn’t change, but you can move through
and between obstructions as if you were two size
categories smaller; and
• you gain the following action: Melee Weapon Attack:
spellcasting ability modifier + proficiency
bonus to hit, range 5 ft., one target;
Hit: 4d6 acid or poison damage (your
choice), and the target must make
a successful Constitution saving
throw or be poisoned until the start
of your next turn.
=== SPELL END ===

=== SPELL START ===
Name: BLOOD TO ACID
Level: 9
School: Transmutation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous
Description:
When you cast this spell, you designate a creature within
range and convert its blood into virulent acid. The target
must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save,
it takes 10d12 acid damage and is stunned by the pain for
1d4 rounds. On a successful save, it takes half the damage
and isn’t stunned.
Creatures without blood, such as constructs and plants,
are not affected by this spell. If blood to acid is cast on
a creature composed mainly of blood, such as a blood
elemental or a blood zombie (Creature Codex, p. 393), the
creature is slain by the spell if its saving throw fails.
=== SPELL END ===

=== SPELL START ===
Name: BOILING OIL
Level: 2
School: Conjuration
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S, M (a vial of oil)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Description:
You conjure a shallow, 15-foot-radius pool of boiling oil
centered on a point within range. The pool is difficult
terrain, and any creature that enters the pool or starts its
turn there must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed
save, the creature takes 3d8 fire damage and falls prone.
On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage
and doesn’t fall prone.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by
1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.
=== SPELL END ===

=== SPELL START ===
Name: BOTTLED ARCANA
Level: 5
School: Transmutation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M (an empty glass container)
Duration: See below
Description:
By touching an empty, stoppered glass container such as a
vial or flask, you magically enable it to hold a single spell.
To be captured, the spell must be cast within 1 round of
casting bottled arcana and it must be intentionally cast into
the container. The container can hold one spell of 3rd level
or lower. The spell can be held in the container for as much
as 24 hours, after which the container reverts to a mundane
vessel and any magic inside it dissipates harmlessly.
As an action, any creature can unstop the container,
thereby releasing the spell. If the spell has a range of self,
the creature opening the container is affected; otherwise,
the creature opening the container designates the target
according to the captured spell’s description. If a creature
opens the container unwittingly (not knowing that the
container holds a spell), the spell targets the creature
opening the container or is centered on its space instead
(whichever is more appropriate). Dispel magic cast on the
container targets bottled arcana, not the spell inside. If
bottled arcana is dispelled, the container becomes mundane
and the spell inside dissipates harmlessly.
Until the spell in the container is released, its caster can’t
regain the spell slot used to cast that spell. Once the spell is
released, its caster regains the use of that slot normally.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
spell slot of 6th level or higher, the level of the spell the
container can hold increases by one for every slot level
above 5th.
=== SPELL END ===

=== SPELL START ===
Name: BOTTOMLESS STOMACH
Level: 1
School: Transmutation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self
Components: V
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour
Description:
When you cast this spell, you gain the ability to
consume dangerous substances and contain them in an
extradimensional reservoir in your stomach. The spell
allows you to swallow most liquids, such as acids, alcohol,
poison, and even quicksilver, and hold them safely in your
stomach. You are unaffected by swallowing the substance,
but the spell doesn’t give you resistance or immunity to the
substance in general; for example, you could safely drink
a bucket of a black dragon’s acidic spittle, but you’d still be
burned if you were caught in the dragon’s breath attack or
if that bucket of acid were dumped over your head.
The spell allows you to store up to 10 gallons of liquid at
one time. The liquid doesn’t need to all be of the same type,
and different types don’t mix while in your stomach. Any
liquid in excess of 10 gallons has its normal effect when
you try to swallow it.
At any time before you stop concentrating on the spell,
you can regurgitate up to 1 gallon of liquid stored in your
stomach as a bonus action. The liquid is vomited into
an adjacent 5-foot square. A target in that square must
succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be affected
by the liquid. The GM determines the exact effect based
on the type of liquid regurgitated, using 1d6 damage of the
appropriate type as the baseline.
When you stop concentrating on the spell, its duration
expires, or it’s dispelled, the extradimensional reservoir
and the liquid it contains cease to exist.
=== SPELL END ===

=== SPELL START ===
Name: BRIMSTONE INFUSION
Level: cantrip
School: Transmutation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M (a flask of alchemist's fire and 5 gp
Duration: 24 hours
Description:
worth of brimstone)
You infuse an ordinary flask of alchemist’s fire with
magical brimstone. While so enchanted, the alchemist’s
fire can be thrown 40 feet instead of 20, and it does 2d6
fire damage instead of 1d4. The Dexterity saving throw
to extinguish the flames uses your spell save DC instead
of DC 10. Infused alchemist’s fire returns to its normal
properties after 24 hours.
=== SPELL END ===

=== SPELL START ===
Name: CAUSTIC TORRENT
Level: 8
School: Conjuration
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self (60-foot line)
Components: V, S, M (a chip of bone pitted by acid)
Duration: Instantaneous
Description:
A swirling jet of acid sprays from you in a direction you
choose. The acid fills a line 60 feet long and 5 feet wide.
Each creature in the line takes 14d6 acid damage, or half
as much damage if it makes a successful Dexterity saving
throw. A creature reduced to 0 hit points by this spell is
killed, and its body is liquefied. In addition, each creature
other than you that’s in the line or within 5 feet of it is
poisoned for 1 minute by toxic fumes. Creatures that
don’t breathe or that are immune to acid damage aren’t
poisoned. A poisoned creature can repeat the Constitution
saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the
effect on itself on a success.
=== SPELL END ===

=== SPELL START ===
Name: DELAY POTION
Level: 2
School: Transmutation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 hour (see below)
Description:
Upon casting this spell, you delay the next potion you
consume from taking effect for up to 1 hour. You must
consume the potion within 1 round of casting delay potion;
otherwise the spell has no effect. At any point during delay
potion’s duration, you can use a bonus action to cause the
potion to go into effect. When the potion is activated,
it works as if you had just drunk it. While the potion is
delayed, it has no effect at all and you can consume and
benefit from other potions normally.
You can delay only one potion at a time. If you try to
delay the effect of a second potion, the spell fails, the first
potion has no effect, and the second potion has its normal
effect when you drink it.
=== SPELL END ===

=== SPELL START ===
Name: GLUEY GLOBULE
Level: 3
School: Conjuration
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 120 feet
Components: V, S, M (a drop of glue)
Duration: 1 minute or 1 hour
Description:
You make a ranged spell attack to hurl a large globule of
sticky, magical glue at a creature within 120 feet. If the
attack hits, the target creature is restrained. A restrained
creature can break free by using an action to make a
successful Strength saving throw. When the creature
breaks free, it takes 2d6 slashing damage from the glue
tearing its skin. If your ranged spell attack roll was a critical
hit or exceeded the target’s AC by 5 or more, the Strength
saving throw is made with disadvantage. The target can also
be freed by an application of universal solvent or by taking
20 acid damage. The glue dissolves when the creature
breaks free or at the end of 1 minute.
Alternatively, gluey globule can also be used to glue an
object to a solid surface or to another object. In this case,
the spell works like a single application of sovereign glue and
lasts for 1 hour.
=== SPELL END ===

=== SPELL START ===
Name: LIFE HACK
Level: 8
School: Necromancy
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 30 feet
Components: V, S, M (a ruby worth 500 gp, which is
Duration: 1 hour
Description:
consumed during the casting)
Choose up to five creatures that you can see within range.
Each of the creatures gains access to a pool of temporary
hit points that it can draw upon over the spell’s duration or
until the pool is used up. The pool contains 120 temporary
hit points. The number of temporary hit points each
individual creature can draw is determined by dividing 120
by the number of creatures with access to the pool. Hit
points are drawn as a bonus action by the creature gaining
the temporary hit points. Any number can be drawn at
once, up to the maximum allowed.
A creature can’t draw temporary hit points from the
pool while it has temporary hit points from any source,
including a previous casting of this spell.
=== SPELL END ===

=== SPELL START ===
Name: MEPHITIC CROAK
Level: 2
School: Conjuration
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self (15-foot cone)
Components: V, S, M (a dead toad and a dram of arsenic
Duration: Instantaneous
Description:
worth 10 gp)
You release an intensely loud burp of acidic gas in a 15-foot
cone. Creatures in the area take 2d6 acid damage plus 2d6
thunder damage, or half as much damage with a successful
Dexterity saving throw. A creature whose Dexterity saving
throw fails must also make a successful Constitution
saving throw or be stunned and poisoned until the start of
your next turn.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
spell slot of 3rd level or higher, both acid and thunder
damage increase by 1d6 for each slot level above 2nd.
=== SPELL END ===

=== SPELL START ===
Name: QUICKSILVER MANTLE
Level: 4
School: Transmutation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self
Components: V, S, M (a nonmagical cloak and a dram of
Duration: 1 hour
Description:
quicksilver worth 10 gp)
You transform an ordinary cloak into a highly reflective,
silvery garment. This mantle increases your AC by 2 and
grants advantage on saving throws against gaze attacks. In
addition, whenever you are struck by a ray such as a ray of
enfeeblement, scorching ray, or even disintegrate, roll 1d4. On a
result of 4, the cloak deflects the ray, which instead strikes
a randomly selected target within 10 feet of you. The cloak
deflects only the first ray that strikes it each round; rays
after the first affect you as normal.
=== SPELL END ===

=== SPELL START ===
Name: RAY OF ALCHEMICAL NEGATION
Level: 4
School: Transmutation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous
Description:
You launch a ray of blazing, polychromatic energy from
your fingertips. Make a ranged spell attack against an
alchemical item or a trap that uses alchemy to achieve its
ends, such as a trap that sprays acid, releases poisonous
gas, or triggers an explosion of alchemist’s fire. A hit
destroys the alchemical reagents, rendering them
harmless. The attack is made against the most suitable
object Armor Class.
This spell can also be used against a creature within range
that is wholly or partially composed of acidic, poisonous,
or alchemical components, such as an alchemical golem
or an ochre jelly. In that case, a hit deals 6d6 force damage,
and the target must make a successful Constitution saving
throw or it deals only half as much damage with its acidic,
poisonous, or alchemical attacks for 1 minute. A creature
whose damage is halved can repeat the saving throw at the
end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.
=== SPELL END ===

=== SPELL START ===
Name: SALT LASH
Level: 3
School: Conjuration
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self
Components: V, S, M (a pinch of salt worth 1 sp, which is
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
Description:
consumed during the casting)
You create a long, thin blade of razor-sharp salt crystals.
You can wield it as a longsword, using your spellcasting
ability to modify your weapon attack rolls. The sword
deals 2d8 slashing damage on a hit, and any creature
struck by the blade must make a successful Constitution
saving throw or be stunned by searing pain until the start
of your next turn. Constructs and undead are immune to
the blade’s secondary (stun) effect; plants and creatures
composed mostly of water, such as water elementals, also
take an additional 2d8 necrotic damage if they fail the
saving throw.
The spell lasts until you stop concentrating on it, the
duration expires, or you let go of the blade for any reason.
Wizards who combine traditional spellcasting with
advanced alchemical practices and concoctions are called
alkemancers. They are a mysterious breed sometimes
confused with transmuters, with whom they share a
complicated rivalry.
Unlike many transmuters, who focus on the physical
transformation of objects and creatures, alkemancers
are concerned with the search for human perfection and
immortality, and they use alchemy as a means in this
pursuit. Still, there is much crossover between the two
specialties. Alkemancers and transmuters can be found
working toward the same goals, as both allies and rivals.
Alkemancy spells typically blend conjuration,
necromancy, and transmutation effects. Few alkemancy
spells belong to the schools of evocation or illusion, since
spells of these schools summon energy out of nothingness
or create things that are not real; both concepts are at odds
with the precepts of alkemancy, which seeks to reduce
energy and matter to its constituent parts and refine them
to a more purified (or useful) state of existence.
Except as noted below, alkemancers function as wizards
and use the wizard spell list.
Beginning when you select this specialty at 2nd level, the
gold and time you must spend to copy an alkemancy spell
into your spellbook are halved.
When you gain a level, one of the two spells you learn
for gaining a level can be an alkemancy spell even if you’ve
never encountered the spell before. Similarly, when you
learn a new cantrip, it can be an alkemancy cantrip even if
you’ve never previously encountered it.
Beginning at 2nd level, you gain proficiency with
alchemical supplies if you did not already have it and your
proficiency bonus with alchemical supplies is doubled. You
also halve the cost of alchemical items you create, enabling
you to fashion most basic items in a single day. Finally, you
gain proficiency with alchemical weapons, and you add
your proficiency bonus to their damage rolls when you use
them as weapons.
Beginning at 6th level, you can add one of the six
fundamental essences to your spells as an additional
material component at the cost of 1 gp per spell level. This
addition doesn't increase the casting time of the spell or
any of its other effects, except as follows.
• Adding brimstone to a spell that deals fire damage gives
the flames a bluish hue and releases irritating vapors. A
creature damaged by the spell must make a successful
Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for a
number of rounds equal to your Intelligence modifier
(minimum of 1).
• Adding lead to a spell that improves your Armor Class,
such as mage armor or shield, increases the spell’s AC
bonus by 2. If the spell has a duration longer than 1
round, the duration increases by a number of rounds
equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1).
Any visible spell effect modified with the addition of
lead takes on a dull gray sheen.
• Adding quicksilver to a spell that changes the form of
a creature or an object, such as alter self or polymorph,
increases the spell’s duration by a number of minutes
equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1
minute). For any such spell that has a duration of less
than 10 minutes, such as alchemical form, the increase
is measured in rounds instead of minutes. Any change
in form modified with quicksilver is accompanied by
lustrous wisps or motes of silvery energy.
• Adding quintessence to a necromancy spell that grants
temporary hit points, such as false life or life hack,
increases the temporary hit points gained by a number
equal to twice your Intelligence modifier (minimum of
2). Adding quintessence to a spell doesn’t change the
spell’s visible aspects.
• Adding salt to a spell that deals acid damage gives the
acid a pale, crystalline hue and causes it to become
extremely painful. Any creature damaged by the spell
must also make a successful Constitution saving throw
or lose 1d4 points from its Strength and Dexterity
scores (rolled separately). These lost ability score points
return automatically after a number of rounds equal to
your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1).
• Adding void salt to a spell that deals necrotic damage
causes the spell to shed palpable strands of darkness.
Any creature damaged by the spell is also surrounded
by a veil of cloying shadows and must make a successful
Constitution saving throw or be restrained for a
number of rounds equal to your Intelligence modifier
(minimum of 1).
Beginning at 10th level, you automatically learn the
formulas for a number of elixirs, oils, philters, or potions
of your choice equal to 1 + your Intelligence modifier
(minimum of one). You do not need to spend time or gold
researching these formulas.
When you brew an elixir, oil, philter, or potion based
on one of the formulas you obtained, you can add exotic
alchemical reagents to the mixture at the cost of additional
gold equal to half the potion's standard cost. If you do so,
the resulting mixture is more powerful than normal: if the
potion’s effect is instantaneous (such as a potion of healing),
it automatically has its maximum effect; if the potion has a
duration (such as a potion of giant strength), it lasts for twice
its normal duration.
Beginning at 14th level, you learn the secret formulas
for brewing the fabled Six Elixirs, magical draughts of
incredible potency and rarity. Each elixir takes a full year
or more to create from exceedingly rare ingredients, but
once finished and consumed or otherwise applied, it
grants its user a permanent bonus of some sort. The six
elixirs are described in the next section.
Additionally, once you reach 14th level, you become so
adept at working with dangerous chemicals and reagents
that you gain resistance to acid damage and poison
damage and immunity to the poisoned condition.
Alkemancers are responsible for the creation of many
astonishing alchemical items, but the pinnacle of their
craftsmanship is known collectively as the Six Elixirs,
magical liquids of such incredible power and rarity that
they feature in many tales and legends. Vast resources
and even many lives have been expended in the pursuit of
these fabled elixirs. A single elixir could be the focus of an
entire campaign arc for an alkemancer character or group
of adventurers.
Brewing any one of the Six Elixirs takes one year of
work with rare, mysterious, and sometimes dangerous
ingredients. The ingredients needed to create each
elixir are given in its description. The GM can modify
ingredients to meet the needs of the campaign.
Potion, legendary
This greasy black liquid acts as a poison when drunk or
rubbed on flesh. Its unfortunate or foolish user takes 12d6
poison damage, or half as much damage with a successful
DC 20 Constitution saving throw.
Its true power is revealed, however, when black elixir is
smeared on a doorway or other portal; the magical oil acts
as a forbiddance spell with a duration of one year. Unlike
the spell, black elixir doesn’t incorporate a password and
only affects celestials and fiends. Typically, the creator of
the elixir determines when the elixir is created whether the
forbiddance effect deals radiant or necrotic damage.
Ingredients. The heart of a marut, the powdered horn of
a ki-rin, and a vial of black mud taken from the bottom of a
lake that at least one celestial or fiend has bathed in.
Potion, legendary
The most famous of the six elixirs is this thick, golden,
syrupy liquid that grants its imbiber eternal life. The
potion completely stops the aging process and renders the
imbiber immune to all natural and magical diseases and
poisons. The drinker can still be harmed or killed through
other methods such as violence, but the march of time no
longer holds any threat over him or her.
Ingredients. A thimble of distilled sunlight, the breath of
a solar, and the hair of a venerable sage who is at least 100
years old.
Potion, legendary
This dark, grainy liquid tastes positively awful. Anyone
imbibing the elixir gains permanent resistance to
bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage and gains a
damage threshold of 5, but their speed is reduced by 10
feet and they always make Dexterity saving throws and
Dexterity ability checks with disadvantage that can’t be
overcome or canceled out by any means.
Ingredients. The core of an iron golem, a shard of purest
adamantine, and the powdered teeth of a mountain giant.
Potion, legendary
This bright green, effervescent elixir grants its consumer
incredible Charisma when dealing with celestials,
elementals, fey, and fiends. The drinker always has
advantage on Charisma checks when dealing with
extraplanar creatures, and when one of the selected
creatures is called or conjured, it arrives with maximum
hit points.
Ingredients. The tears of an invisible stalker, the claw of a
pit fiend, and the tongue of a bard of at least 10th level.
Potion, legendary
This silvery-white elixir has a variety of effects depending
on whether it is drunk, rubbed on a creature's feet, or
smeared on the hull of a boat. If drunk, the elixir confers
the ability to breathe both air and water with equal ease. If
rubbed on the feet, the elixir provides a creature with the
ability to walk on water as if wearing a ring of water walking.
If placed on the hull of a boat or similar vessel, the vessel
gains a damage threshold of 20 against all environmental
effects, and anyone piloting the vessel has advantage on
ability checks associated with it. All of these effects are
permanent.
Ingredients. The scale of a merfolk princess, a vial of pure
elemental water, and the eye of a kraken.
Potion, legendary
This vermilion-hued elixir neutralizes all magical and
nonmagical diseases and poisons, all curses of 8th level or
lower, and all exhaustion effects, as well as restoring hit
points as a superior healing potion. If this elixir is poured
over a corpse that has been dead for no more than a year, it
restores the creature to life (as the resurrection spell) even if
the corpse could normally not be resurrected.
Ingredients. A mixture of purest cinnabar, the blood of
a slain dragon of at least adult age, and the hearts of six
celestial tigers willingly donated to the alkemancer.
Alkemancers have devised countless magic items over the
centuries. Their creations range from fairly standard items
such as the bubbling retort and scalehide cream to uniquely
alkemantic items such as Anuraag's crucible.
Wondrous item, very rare
This large alembic is a glass retort supported by a bronze
tripod and connected to a smaller glass container by a
bronze spout. The bronze fittings are etched with arcane
symbols, and the glass parts of the alembic sometimes
emit bright, amethyst sparks.
If a magic item is placed inside the alembic and a fire lit
beneath it, the magic item dissolves and its magical energy
drains into the smaller container. Artifacts, legendary
magic items, and any magic item that won’t physically fit
into the alembic (anything larger than a shortsword or a
cloak) can’t be dissolved in this way. Full dissolution and
distillation of an item’s magical energy takes 1 hour, but 10
minutes is enough time to render most items nonmagical.
If an item spends a full hour dissolving in the alembic,
its magical energy coalesces in the smaller container as
a lump of material resembling gray-purple, stiff dough
known as arcanoplasm. This material is safe to handle
and easy to incorporate into new magic items. Using
arcanoplasm while creating a magic item reduces the cost
of the new item by 10 percent per degree of rarity of the
magic item that was distilled into the arcanoplasm.
An alembic of unmaking can distill or disenchant one item
per 24 hours.
ANURAAG’S CRUCIBLE
Artifact
Thousands of years ago, a powerful alkemancer named
Anuraag constructed an enormous crucible in his quest
to create the perfect organism. He hoped it would
bring forth an immortal being that could surpass the
limitations imposed by human flesh and surpass even
the gods. Anuraag used the crucible to create so many
monstrosities that eventually the local deities had to take
action against him. The alkemancer was destroyed for
his impertinence, and his crucible was sealed away at the
bottom of a mighty chasm.
Anuraag's crucible is an enormous object fashioned from
white clay and engraved with mystical symbols chased
with burnished copper and electrum. The crucible is
large enough to hold a single Huge creature, two Large
creatures, four Medium creatures, or eight Small ones.
If one or more creatures are placed in the crucible and
the crucible is heated over an intense, magical flame, each
creature must make a DC 20 Constitution saving throw
against the crucible’s powerful transmutation magic. If
this saving throw fails, the creature’s body liquefies and
the creature is blinded, deafened, and paralyzed until the
transformation is complete. The creature’s equipment
doesn’t dissolve; as a result, most creatures are stripped
naked before being placed in the crucible. Over the course
of 10 minutes, the liquefied creature transforms into
another creature.
If this transformation is interrupted, the transforming
creature is slain. It can be brought back to life in its
original form by a resurrection spell or comparable magic.
If the process reaches completion, the creature
transforms into another creature as if affected by a
shapechange spell. The transformed creature must make
a successful DC 20 Wisdom saving throw or lose its
memory and all its previous abilities, traits, and features,
which are replaced by the blank mind of a newly born
version of the creature it transformed into. Whether or not
a creature retains its mental faculties, the newly assumed
form is permanent. At that point, the creature can regain
its former form (and memories and abilities) only through
a wish spell or comparable magic.
Constructs and undead are immune to the crucible’s
power, as is any creature that can change its shape at will,
such as a doppelganger.
To determine what a creature transforms into, roll a d20.

Destroying the Crucible. Anuraag's crucible can be
destroyed if a celestial and a fiend, both of at least challenge
rating 15, willingly allow themselves to be transformed at
the same time. If this happens, the crucible can’t take the
burden of transforming both creatures and shatters in a
spectacular explosion that deals 20d6 piercing damage to
all creatures in a 60-foot radius, or half as much damage
with a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw.
Potion, very rare
This foul-smelling, murky, purple-gray liquid is created
from the liquefied brains of spellcasting creatures such as
aboleths. Anyone consuming this repulsive mixture must
make a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw. On a successful
save, the drinker is infused with magical power and regains
1d6 + 4 expended spell slots. On a failed save, the drinker
is afflicted with a form of short-term madness lasting for
1 day. If a creature consumes multiple doses of brain juice
and fails three consecutive Intelligence saving throws,
it gains a form of long-term madness permanently and
automatically fails all further saving throws brought about
by drinking brain juice.
Wondrous item, uncommon
This long, thin retort is fashioned from smoky yellow glass
and is topped with an intricately carved brass stopper.
You can unstopper the retort and fill it with liquid as an
action. Once you do so, it spews out multicolored bubbles
in a 20-foot radius. The bubbles last for 1d4 + 1 rounds.
While they last, creatures within the radius are blinded and
the area is heavily obscured to all creatures except those
with tremorsense. The liquid in the retort is destroyed in
the process with no harmful effect on its surroundings. If
any bubbles are popped, they burst with a wet smacking
sound but no other effect.
Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)
This wide leather girdle has many sewn-in pouches and
holsters that hold an assortment of empty beakers and
vials. Once you have attuned to the girdle, these containers
magically fill with the following liquids:
• 2 flasks of alchemist’s fire
• 2 flasks of alchemist’s ice
• 2 vials of acid
• 2 jars of swarm repellent
• 1 vial of assassin’s blood poison
• 1 potion of climbing
• 1 potion of healing
Each container magically replenishes each day at dawn, if
you are wearing the girdle. All the potions and alchemical
substances produced by the girdle lose their properties if
they’re transferred to another container before being used.
Wondrous item, uncommon
Sometimes known as weedkiller oil, this greasy brown fluid
contains the crushed husks of dozens of locusts. One vial
of the oily substance can coat one weapon or up to five
pieces of ammunition. Applying the oil takes 1 minute.
Once applied, the coated weapon or ammunition deals an
additional 1d6 necrotic damage to plants or plant creatures
on every successful hit for the next hour.
The oil can also be applied directly to a willing, helpless,
or immobile plant or plant creature. In this case, the
substance deals 4d6 necrotic damage, which is enough to
kill most ordinary plant life smaller than a large tree.
POTION, PILL FORM
Rarity varies by potion type
Alkemancers have mastered the craft of condensing
potions into pills. Potions in pill form have the same effect
as regular potions and have the same color as the potions
they’re derived from, but an individual pill has effectively
no weight and can be concealed very easily in a boot,
pouch, hatband, or secret pocket. A pill can be swallowed
as a bonus action. A potion in pill form costs five times as
much as the regular version of the potion.
Wondrous item, rare
As an action, you can rub this dull green cream over your
skin. When you do, you sprout thick, olive-green scales
like those of a giant lizard or green dragon that last for
1 hour. These scales give you a natural AC of 15 + your
Constitution modifier. This natural AC doesn’t combine
with any worn armor or with a Dexterity bonus to AC.
A jar of scalehide cream contains 1d6 + 1 doses.
In addition to the many spells and magic items
alkemancers have created, they are also responsible for
scores of nonmagical items that are tremendously useful. A
few of these are described here.
ALCHEMIST’S ICE
This blue-white flask is cool to the touch because it contains
a volatile liquid that turns to ice when exposed to air. If the
flask is poured over a surface, it creates a 5-foot patch of ice
that functions as regular ice for movement purposes. The
flask can be thrown at a creature like a flask of alchemist’s
fire; if it hits, it deals 1d8 cold damage and the creature
must make a successful DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or its
speed becomes 0 until the start of your next turn.
Alchemist’s ice was invented by alkemancers in the
tropics as a way of keeping their food and drinks cold, and
many restaurants and taverns still use it for this purpose. A
vial of alchemist’s ice costs 50 gp.
The head of this arrow is fitted with a syringe that can be
filled with liquid. When it strikes a creature, the arrow
deals 1d4 piercing damage plus the effect of whatever
liquid the syringe injects into the creature. Poisons are
commonly employed, as are acid, drugs, and various
eclectic potions.
A hypodermic arrow is extremely fragile; it always
breaks on impact, whether it hits the target or not. One
hypodermic arrow costs 25 gp. They’re always sold empty,
but those found in treasure hoards or among monsters’
gear might be already filled. Filling the syringe takes an
action, but it can be done hours or days before the arrow is
used.
This slimy yellow paste can be smeared over exposed parts
of the body to protect against attacks by insect swarms. A
swarm of ants, beetles, biting flies, wasps, or similar insects
that enters your space while you’re protected by swarm
repellent must make a successful DC 10 Constitution
saving throw or be unable to attack you. A repelled swarm
can repeat this saving throw at the start of its next turn;
most swarms prefer to seek out an unprotected target.
A jar of swarm repellent costs 40 gp and holds enough
paste to protect two Medium or four Small creatures.
Applying the repellent takes 1 minute, so it’s not a good
option in the middle of combat, but it’s effective for 1 hour
or until you’re immersed in water.
A tooth capsule is a false tooth, or a cap that fits over a
tooth, that contains a dose of a potion in pill form. (The pill
loaded into a tooth capsule can’t be changed.) To activate
the tooth capsule, you simply bite down on it as a bonus
action and make a DC 10 Strength check. On a successful
check, the capsule shatters and releases the pill, which you
can then swallow, hold in your mouth, or spit out.
Determining whether a tooth in someone else’s mouth
is a tooth capsule takes a successful DC 15 Intelligence
(Investigation) or Wisdom (Medicine) check. Obviously,
the creature must be restrained, unconscious, paralyzed,
or cooperative in order for the tooth to be examined.
Tooth capsules containing poison are often used by spies
and operatives of fanatical organizations who are willing
to die rather than allow their secrets to be captured by their
enemies.
Tooth capsules are usually priced at 100 gp plus the cost
of whatever potion they’re loaded with. The use of poison
or other harmful potions in a tooth capsule is illegal in
some places, and the black market price for one in such a
place might be much higher.
The heavenly planes shine with light and power, as deities
both benevolent and stern look down from their thrones.
Without question, the most powerful of those gods’ servants
are the angels. Angels carry the word of their creators to
mortal ears and bring down their righteous blades against
creatures of darkness. These entities are mighty beyond
mortal ken, and their very names seethe with the essence of
creation. The secrets of harnessing the power of the angels
are hidden within those names, and a select few mortals
have learned how to realize that potential.
The first angelic seals and wards were passed to worthy
mortals as rewards for their sacrifice and valor in the
service of light, and as weapons to be used in the struggle
against the fiendish hordes. An angelic seal is the written
form of the true name of an angel, inscribed on an object
or a surface in a particular way to draw on the essence of
that angel’s power. That power flows through the written
Angelic Magic
VARIANT RULE: VIRTUOUS CASTERS
Angelic spells are principally intended to be used by
good‑aligned spellcasters, though nothing prevents
non‑good casters from learning them. As an optional rule,
the DM can declare that a non‑good caster of angelic
spells can gradually become more inclined toward a good
alignment, provided that the caster uses such magic
frequently for non‑evil purposes.
The alignment of a spellcaster who satisfies that condition
while advancing through two levels of experience moves
from evil to neutral or from neutral to good (at the player's
option, for a player character). After gaining an additional
four levels, a caster who started out evil can move from
neutral to good.
Angelic magic has no effect on the lawful or chaotic
component of a caster's alignment.
Knowledge of angelic spells is rare, and it’s not possible
for a spellcaster to develop or learn these esoteric spells
without being trained in these specialized practices.
Occasionally, the powers of light make a gift of a particular
spell to a favored champion. Also, tomes containing the
notes and experiments of the first angelic scribes still exist
in hidden libraries and forgotten shrines.
A spellcaster fortunate enough to discover an angelic
spell in written form can gain access to it through study.
The usual method of gaining this access is through the
pursuit of the angelic scribe wizard specialty. Angelic
scribes preserve the knowledge embodied in the angels’
names and pass those secrets to their apprentices so the
forces of good will always be able to wield their mightiest
weapons in times of need.
representation and into the individual who carries it, or
into a location that bears a ward. The angel isn’t harmed or
hindered when a fraction of its power is siphoned this way,
but it does notice, and woe befalls any wicked soul who
steals the secret of a seal and misuses its power.
Seals and wards aren’t the only expressions of angelic
power available to mortals. In the ages since the first
angelic names were carved into earthly forms, the battles
between light and darkness have tested the limits of the
heavenly host. In the wake of these struggles, mortal
practitioners experimented with variations on the seals
and found ways to isolate the power of the angels and
shape it into spells.

Celestial)
You create a sword of pure white fire in your free hand.
The blade is similar in size and shape to a longsword, and
it lasts for the duration. The blade disappears if you let go
of it, but you can call it forth again as a bonus action.
You can use your action to make a melee spell attack
with the blade. On a hit, the target takes 2d8 fire damage
and 2d8 radiant damage. An aberration, fey, fiend, or
undead creature damaged by the blade must succeed on
a Wisdom saving throw or be frightened until the start of
your next turn.
The blade sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim
light for an additional 20 feet.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell
slot of 4th level or higher, either the fire damage or the

=== SPELL START ===
Name: BLAZING CHARIOT
Level: 5
School: Conjuration
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 30 feet
Components: V, S, M (a small golden wheel worth 250 gp)
Duration: 1 hour
Description:
Calling upon the might of the angels, you conjure a
flaming chariot made of gold and mithral in an unoccupied
10-foot-square space you can see within range. Two horses
made of fire and light pull the chariot. You and up to
three other Medium or smaller creatures you designate
can board the chariot (at the cost of 5 feet of movement)
and are unharmed by the flames. Any other creature that
touches the chariot or hits it (or a creature riding in it) with
a melee attack while within 5 feet of the chariot takes 3d6
fire damage and 3d6 radiant damage. The chariot has AC 18
and 50 hit points, is immune to fire, poison, psychic, and
radiant damage, and has resistance to all other nonmagical
damage. The horses are not separate creatures but are part
of the chariot. The chariot vanishes if it is reduced to 0 hit
points, and any creature riding it falls out. The chariot has a
speed of 50 feet and a flying speed of 40 feet.
On your turn, you can guide the chariot in place of your
own movement. You can use a bonus action to direct it to
take the Dash, Disengage, or Dodge action. As an action,
you can use the chariot to overrun creatures in its path. On
this turn, the chariot can enter a hostile creature’s space.
The creature takes damage as if it had touched the chariot,
is shunted to the nearest unoccupied space that it can
occupy, and must make a successful Strength saving throw
or fall prone in that space.

=== SPELL START ===
Name: BLESSED HALO
Level: 2
School: Evocation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self
Components: V, S

and dim light for an additional 20 feet.
This spell grants you a pool of 10 points of healing. When
you cast the spell and as an action on subsequent turns
during the spell’s duration, you can expend points from
this pool to restore an equal number of hit points to one
creature within 20 feet that you can see.
Additionally, you have advantage on Charisma checks
made against good creatures within 20 feet.
If any of the light created by this spell overlaps an area of
magical darkness created by a spell of 2nd level or lower,
the spell that created the darkness is dispelled.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell
slot of 3rd level or higher, the spell’s pool of healing points
increases by 5 for each spell slot above 2nd, and the spell
dispels magical darkness created by a spell of a level equal
to the slot used to cast this spell.

=== SPELL START ===
Name: CELESTIAL FANFARE
Level: 6
School: Evocation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 100 feet
Components: V, S, M (miniature trumpet worth 100 gp)
Duration: Instantaneous
Description:
A great blaring of trumpets from on high blasts down
upon an area you designate. All evil creatures in a 30-foot
radius take 4d6 thunder damage and 4d6 radiant damage
and are blinded and deafened for 2d4 rounds. A successful
Constitution saving throw reduces the damage and the
duration of the blinded and deafened conditions by half.
Neutral or unaligned creatures within the area take
half as much damage and are blinded and deafened for
1d4 rounds. A successful save reduces the damage to
one-quarter and negates the blinding and deafening effects.
Good-aligned creatures are not harmed by this spell.
DEVA’S WINGS
=== SPELL END ===

=== SPELL START ===
Name: DEVA’S WINGS
Level: 4
School: Transmutation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M (a wing feather from any bird)
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
Description:
You touch a willing creature. The target grows feathery
wings of pure white that grant it a flying speed of 60 feet
and the ability to hover. When the target takes the Attack
action, it can use a bonus action to make a melee weapon
attack with the wings, with a reach of 10 feet. If the wing
attack hits, the target takes bludgeoning damage equal to
1d6 + your spellcasting ability modifier and must make a
successful Strength saving throw or fall prone. When the
spell ends, the wings disappear, and the target falls if it
was aloft.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell
slot of 5th level or higher, you can target one additional
target for each slot level above 4th.
9th-level abjuration (ritual) (angelic)
Casting Time: 1 minute
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M (incense and special inks worth
500 gp, which the spell consumes)
Duration: 24 hours
You inscribe an angelic seal on the ground, the floor,
or other solid surface of a structure. The seal creates a
spherical sanctuary with a radius of 100 feet, centered on
the seal. For the duration, aberrations, elementals, fey,
fiends, and undead that approach to within 5 feet of the
boundary know they are about to come into contact with
a deadly barrier. If such a creature moves so as to touch
the boundary, or tries to cross the boundary by any means,
including teleportation and extradimensional travel, it
must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, it
takes 15d8 radiant damage, is repelled to 5 feet outside the
boundary, and can’t target anything inside the boundary
with attacks, spells, or abilities until the spell ends. On a
successful save, the creature takes half as much radiant
damage and can cross the boundary. If the creature is
a fiend that isn’t on its home plane, it is immediately
destroyed (no saving throw) instead of taking damage.
Aberrations, elementals, fey, and undead that are
within 100 feet of the seal (inside the boundary) have
disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, and saving
throws, and each such creature takes 4d8 radiant damage
at the start of its turn.
Creatures other than aberrations, elementals, fey,
fiends, and undead can’t be charmed or frightened while
within 100 feet of the seal.
The seal has AC 18, 75 hit points, resistance to
bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, and
immunity to psychic and poison damage. Ranged attacks
against the seal are made with disadvantage. If it is scribed
on the surface of an object that is later destroyed (such as
a wooden door), the seal is not damaged and remains in
place, perhaps suspended in midair. The spell ends only if
the seal itself is reduced to 0 hit points.
=== SPELL END ===

=== SPELL START ===
Name: QUINTESSENCE
Level: 8
School: Transmutation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self (120-foot radius)
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Description:
By calling upon an archangel, you become infused with
celestial essence and take on angelic features such as
golden skin, glowing eyes, and ethereal wings. For the
duration of the spell, your Armor Class can’t be lower
than 20, you can’t be frightened, and you are immune to
necrotic damage.
In addition, each hostile creature that starts its turn
within 120 feet of you or enters that area for the first time
on a turn must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or
be frightened for 1 minute. A creature frightened in this
way is restrained. A frightened creature can repeat the
saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the
effect on itself on a success. If a creature’s saving throw
is successful or if the effect ends for it, the creature is
immune to the frightening effect of the spell until you cast
quintessence again.
7th-level abjuration (ritual) (angelic)
Casting Time: 1 minute
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M (incense and special inks worth
250 gp, which the spell consumes)
Duration: 24 hours
You inscribe an angelic seal on the ground, the floor,
or other solid surface of a structure. The seal creates a
spherical sanctuary with a radius of 50 feet, centered on
the seal. For the duration, aberrations, elementals, fey,
fiends, and undead that approach to within 5 feet of the
boundary know they are about to come into contact with
a deadly barrier. If such a creature moves so as to touch
the boundary, or tries to cross the boundary by any means,
including teleportation and extradimensional travel, it
must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, it
takes 10d8 radiant damage, is repelled to 5 feet outside the
boundary, and can’t target anything inside the boundary
with attacks, spells, or abilities until the spell ends. On a
successful save, the creature takes half as much radiant
damage and can cross the boundary. If the creature is
a fiend that isn’t on its home plane, it is immediately
destroyed (no saving throw) instead of taking damage.
Aberrations, elementals, fey, and undead that are
within 50 feet of the seal (inside the boundary) have
disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, and saving
throws, and each such creature takes 2d8 radiant damage
at the start of its turn.
Creatures other than aberrations, elementals, fey,
fiends, and undead can’t be charmed or frightened while
within 50 feet of the seal.
The seal has AC 18, 50 hit points, resistance to
bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, and
immunity to psychic and poison damage. Ranged attacks
against the seal are made with disadvantage. If it is scribed
on the surface of an object that is later destroyed (such as
a wooden door), the seal is not damaged and remains in
place, perhaps suspended in midair. The spell ends only if
the seal is reduced to 0 hit points.
An angelic scribe studies the angelic seals that harness the
power of celestial messengers through their names and
shapes that power into magical effects. Beyond the seals
and wardings themselves, you learn esoteric spells to call
down the essence of the angelic host.
Most angelic scribes take up their craft out of reverence
and a desire to protect the righteous; a few tempt angelic
wrath with their lust for power that’s otherwise beyond
their grasp.
How to Start: If you’re a wizard who wants to become
an angelic scribe, you make that decision upon reaching
2nd level, when you are also entitled to choose an arcane
tradition. If you decide to follow the path of the angelic
scribe exclusively, you can forego the selection of an
arcane tradition and gain the features of the angelic scribe
specialty instead.
You can also pursue the angelic scribe specialty in
conjunction with one of the standard arcane traditions. If
you choose to do this, you gain the Savant feature of your
chosen school in addition to Angelic Savant (described
below). Also at 2nd level, you choose whether to gain Seal
Scribe (see below) or the 2nd-level feature of your chosen
school. Thereafter, at 6th, 10th, and 14th level, you choose
between the lowest-level features still available. For
instance, a conjurer might select Seal Scribe at 2nd level
and Minor Conjuration at 6th level, followed by either
Warding Seal or Benign Transposition at 10th level.
For a cleric, the process is much the same except that it
involves making choices between angelic scribe features
and the features provided by your domain. These decisions
occur at 2nd, 6th, 8th, and 17th level instead of at the levels
indicated for wizards.
Paladins, although they can cast angelic spells and gain
angelic feats, cannot become angelic scribes.
Beginning when you take up this specialty at 2nd level, the
gold and time you must spend to copy an angelic spell into
your spellbook is halved.
Also at 2nd level, you learn the Celestial language if you
don’t already know it, and you gain the ability to scribe
angelic seals.
Seals. You learn two angelic seals of your choice, which
are detailed below under “Angelic Seals.” You can spend
10 minutes scribing an angelic seal you know on paper,
canvas, stone tiles, or some other surface or object that
can be carried or displayed. Alternatively, you can spend
8 hours using appropriate artisan tools to carve or etch a
more permanent seal into harder material. Once you have
scribed a seal, you can activate it as an action.
• You can have one seal active at a time. The number of
active seals you can maintain increases by one at 6th
level (two seals), 10th level (three seals), and 14th level
(four seals).
• A seal’s magic is suppressed while you are
concentrating on maintaining a spell or a similar effect.
A suppressed seal still counts against the number of
active seals you can maintain.
• As a bonus action, you can deactivate a seal prior
to activating another one. A broken or defaced seal
deactivates immediately and must be replaced.
• You can give an active seal to another creature, enabling
it to gain the benefit of the seal while it holds or openly
wears the seal, except when it is concentrating on
maintaining a spell or a similar effect.
• You learn one additional angelic seal of your choice at
6th, 10th, and 14th levels. Each time you learn a new
seal, you can also replace one seal you know with a
different one.
Beginning at 6th level, you can place warding seals to
protect areas. This follows the procedure for scribing
an angelic seal, but a warding seal must be fashioned on
the ground, the floor, or a similarly suitable portion of a
structure such as a wall, column, or ceiling. As an action,
you can touch the seal to activate it. You must maintain
concentration on the effect as if concentrating on a spell.
Once activated, a warding seal creates a spherical
“safe space” that extends out to 30 feet around it, large
enough to surround a small building or series of rooms
of appropriate dimensions (a 22-foot cube, for example,
or any space of approximately 11,000 cubic feet). An
aberration, fey, fiend, or undead cannot physically cross
the boundary, cast spells through it, or project its abilities
across the boundary unless it makes a successful Charisma
saving throw against your spell save DC. A creature that
fails the saving throw can try again on its next turn. A
creature that makes a sucessful save and moves across
the boundary into the protected area isn’t affected by the
boundary while it remains inside (the boundary impedes
only incoming entities and effects, not outgoing ones), but
it must contend with the ward again if it leaves the area
and tries to reenter.
Starting at 10th level (or 8th level for a cleric), you can
use an action to empower one of your active angelic
seals or warding seals to greater effect. If you choose an
angelic seal, its user typically gains the greater benefit of
the seal for 1 minute (unless otherwise noted), replacing
the normal benefit during that time. If you choose a
warding seal, for the next hour a creature that fails its
saving throw against the ward takes 6d6 radiant damage
and automatically fails additional saves against the ward
during this time.
You can use this ability twice, and you regain expended
uses when you finish a short or long rest.
At 14th level (or 17th level for a cleric), you add conjure
celestial to your spellbook or your spells known if you don’t
already know it.
Additionally, you can use a bonus action to infuse
your seals with angelic wrath. For 1 minute, you deal an
additional 1d8 radiant damage with weapon attacks—and
so does anyone within 30 feet of you that is in possession
of one of your active seals.
You can’t use this ability again until you finish a short or
long rest.
Each angelic seal consists of the name of an angel, written
in Celestial on a suitable surface, that resonates with a
given seal’s effect.
Amnayeth (Benevolence). This seal allows the user to
reroll a failed ability check to improve another creature’s
attitude. Greater: As an action once during the next
minute, the user can cause a creature that can hear the
user to make a successful Wisdom saving throw against
your spell save DC or be charmed for 10 minutes.
This seal can’t be used again on a check involving the
same creature until the user finishes a short or long rest.
Simil (Clarity). The user adds half your Intelligence
modifier (minimum of 1) to its Wisdom (Insight) and
Wisdom (Perception) checks for 1 minute. Greater: The
user gains blindsight out to a range of 10 feet.
Rikbil (Fortitude). When it is hit with an attack, the user
can use its reaction to add 2 to its AC against that attack. It
must be able to see the attacker to use this effect. Greater:
The user gains resistance to nonmagical bludgeoning,
piercing, and slashing damage.
Barrateth (Fortune). The user can add 1 to an attack roll,
saving throw, or ability check. The addition is made after
rolling the die but before the GM reveals whether it was
a success or failure. Greater: After making an attack roll,
saving throw, or ability check, the user can roll another
d20 and choose which result to use. The second roll is
made after the initial roll but before the GM reveals
whether that roll was a success or failure.
This seal can’t be used again until the user finishes a
short or long rest.
Vrechiel (Glory). When the user reduces an enemy to 0
hit points, the user gains temporary hit points equal to
your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1). Greater: At
the start of its turn once during the next minute, the user
gains temporary hit points equal to your caster level.
Ophanim (Humility). The user adds half your
Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1) to its Dexterity
(Stealth) checks. It keeps this benefit until the start
of its next turn when it takes a hostile action (any
action that could inflict intentional damage
on a creature). Greater: If it hasn’t taken a
hostile action this turn, the user can use
its action to present an aura of humility.
A creature that wants to attack the user
must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw
against your spell save DC or choose
another target. If there are no other
targets it can attack, the creature spends
its action doing nothing.
Chamule (Judgment). When the user
hits a creature with an opportunity attack,
the user can move up to half its speed,
provided it ends the move no farther
away from the creature it hit. Greater: As a
reaction when it is hit with an attack once
during the next minute, the user can cause
the attacker to take radiant damage equal to
your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1) if the attacker is
within 60 feet of the user.
Jelaal (Recovery). The user automatically succeeds on
its first death saving throw and then regains 1 hit point.
Greater: When the user regains hit points, it regains an
additional number of hit points equal to your Intelligence
modifier (minimum of 1). Once it is used, this seal doesn’t
function again until the user finishes a short or long rest.
Iaothe (Temperance). When it makes a Wisdom saving
throw, the user can use its reaction to add your Intelligence
modifier (minimum of 1) to the roll. The bonus is added
after the die is rolled but before the GM reveals whether
the saving throw succeeds or fails. Greater: The user can’t
be charmed or frightened.
Once it is used, this seal doesn’t function again until the
user finishes a short or long rest.
Xapanie (Wrath). Once on the user’s turn when it
hits with a weapon attack, the attack gains a +1 bonus to
damage. Greater: The user’s attacks are magical, and once
on the user’s turn during the next minute when it hits with
a weapon attack, the attack deals additional radiant damage
equal to half your caster level (minimum of 1).
There exists a form of raw arcane power with no rules or
structure—only an unthinking addiction to changing
the reality with which it comes into contact. This force
is known as chaos magic. Those who learn to channel
this energy eventually expand and aid this magic in its
chaos; to master it, though, chaos demands an emotional
price of extreme highs and lows. An eccentric lifestyle
or even full-on madness is common among chaos magic
specialists, who are collectively known as chaos mages.

DescriptionsThe following spells are presented in alphabetical order.
=== SPELL END ===

=== SPELL START ===
Name: BABBLE
Level: 5
School: Enchantment
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour
Description:
This spell causes the speech of affected creatures to sound
like nonsense. Each creature in a 30-foot-radius sphere
centered on a point you choose within range must succeed
on an Intelligence saving throw when you cast this spell or
be affected by it.
An affected creature cannot communicate in any spoken
language that it knows. When it speaks, the words come
out as gibberish. Spells with verbal components cannot be
cast. The spell does not affect telepathic communication,
nonverbal communication, or sounds emitted by any
creature that does not have a spoken language. As an
action, a creature under the effect of this spell can attempt
another Intelligence saving throw against the effect. On a
successful save, the spell ends.
=== SPELL END ===

=== SPELL START ===
Name: BAD TIMING
Level: 2
School: Divination
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V
Duration: Instantaneous
Description:
You point toward a creature that you can see and twist
strands of chaotic energy around its fate. If the target gets
a failure on a Charisma saving throw, the next attack roll
or ability check the creature attempts within 10 minutes is
made with disadvantage.
=== SPELL END ===

=== SPELL START ===
Name: CALM OF THE STORM
Level: 3
School: Abjuration
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M (an amethyst worth 250 gp, which
Duration: Instantaneous
Description:
the spell consumes)
While visualizing the world as you wish it was, you lay
your hands upon a creature other than yourself and undo
the effect of a chaos magic surge that affected the creature
within the last minute. Reality reshapes itself as if the
surge never happened, but only for that creature.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell
slot of 4th level or higher, the time since the chaos magic
surge can be 1 minute longer for each slot level above 3rd.
=== SPELL END ===

=== SPELL START ===
Name: CHAOTIC FORM
Level: 4
School: Transmutation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Duration: 10 minutes
Description:
You cause the form of a willing creature to become
malleable, dripping and flowing according to the target’s
will as if the creature were a vaguely humanoid-shaped
ooze. The creature is not affected by difficult terrain, it has
advantage on Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks made to escape
a grapple, and it suffers no penalties when squeezing
through spaces one size smaller than itself. The target’s
movement is halved while it is affected by chaotic form.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
spell slot of 5th level or higher, the duration increases by 10
minutes for each slot level above 4th.
=== SPELL END ===

=== SPELL START ===
Name: CHAOTIC VITALITY
Level: 2
School: Conjuration
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous
Description:
Make a melee spell attack against a creature that has a
number of Hit Dice no greater than your level and has
at least 1 hit point. On a hit, you conjure pulsating waves
of chaotic energy within the creature and yourself. After
a brief moment that seems to last forever, your hit point
total changes, as does the creature’s. Roll a d100 and
increase or decrease the number rolled by any number up
to your spellcasting level, then find the result on the Hit
Point Flux table. Apply that result both to yourself and the
target creature. Any hit points gained beyond a creature’s
normal maximum are temporary hit points that last for 1
round per caster level.
For example, a 3rd-level spellcaster who currently has
17 of her maximum 30 hit points casts chaotic vitality on a
creature with 54 hit points and rolls a 75 on the Hit Point
Flux table. The two creatures have a combined total of 71
hit points. A result of 75 indicates that both creatures get
50 percent of the total, so the spellcaster and the target
end up with 35 hit points each. In the spellcaster’s case, 5 of
those hit points are temporary and will last for 3 rounds.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the maximum Hit Dice
of the affected creature increases by 2 for each slot level
above 2nd.
01–09 0
10–39 1
40–69 25 percent of total
70–84 50 percent of total
85–94 75 percent of total
95–99 100 percent of total
100 200 percent of total, and both creatures gain the
effect of a haste spell that lasts for 1 round per
caster level

Name: CHAOTIC WORLD
Level: 6
School: Illusion
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, M (seven irregular pieces of colored
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Description:
cloth that you throw into the air)
You throw a handful of colored cloth into the air while
screaming a litany of disjointed phrases. A moment later,
a 30-foot cube centered on a point within range fills with
multicolored light, cacophonous sound, overpowering
scents, and other confusing sensory information. The
effect is dizzying and overwhelming. Each enemy within
the cube must make a successful Intelligence saving throw
or become blinded and deafened, and fall prone. An affected
enemy cannot stand up or recover from the blindness or
deafness while within the area, but all three conditions end
immediately for a creature that leaves the spell’s area.
=== SPELL END ===

=== SPELL START ===
Name: ELEMENTAL TWIST
Level: 2
School: Evocation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self

around itself)
During this spell’s duration, reality shifts around you
whenever you cast a spell that deals acid, cold, fire,
lightning, poison, or thunder damage. Assign each
damage type a number and roll a d6 to determine the type
of damage this casting of the spell deals. In addition, the
spell’s damage increases by 1d6. All other properties or
effects of the spell are unchanged.
=== SPELL END ===

=== SPELL START ===
Name: ENTROPIC DAMAGE FIELD
Level: 3
School: Transmutation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S, M (a silver wire)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Description:
By twisting a length of silver wire around your finger, you
tie your fate to those around you. When you take damage,
that damage is divided equally between you and all
creatures in range who get a failure on a Charisma saving
throw. Any leftover damage that can’t be divided equally
is taken by you. Creatures that approach to within 60 feet
of you after the spell was cast are also affected. A creature
is allowed a new saving throw against this spell each time
you take damage, and a successful save ends the spell’s
effect on that creature.
=== SPELL END ===

=== SPELL START ===
Name: FLUCTUATING ALIGNMENT
Level: 4
School: Enchantment
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 120 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
Description:
You channel the force of chaos to taint your target’s mind.
A target that gets a failure on a Wisdom saving throw must
roll 1d20 and consult the Alignment Fluctuation table to
find its new alignment, and it must roll again after every
minute of the spell’s duration. The target’s alignment stops
fluctuating and returns to normal when the spell ends.
These changes do not make the affected creature friendly
or hostile toward the caster, but they can cause creatures to
behave in unpredictable ways.

Name: FRENZIED BOLT
Level: 2
School: Evocation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 120 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous
Description:
You direct a bolt of rainbow colors toward a creature
of your choice within range. If the bolt hits, the target
takes 3d8 damage, of a type determined by rolling on the
Random Damage Type table. If your attack roll (not the
adjusted result) was odd, the bolt leaps to a new target of
your choice within range that has not already been targeted
by frenzied bolt, requiring a new spell attack roll to hit. The
bolt continues leaping to new targets until you roll an even
number on your spell attack roll, miss a target, or run out
of potential targets. You and your allies are legal targets for
this spell, if you are particularly lucky—or unlucky.
D
1 Acid
2 Cold
3 Fire
4 Force
5 Lightning
6 Necrotic
7 Poison
8 Psychic
9 Radiant
10 Thunder
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell
slot of 3rd level or higher, you create an additional bolt for
each slot level above 2nd. Each potential target can be hit
only once by each casting of the spell, not once per bolt.
ILL-FATED WORD

=== SPELL START ===
Name: ILL-FATED WORD
Level: 1
School: Divination
Casting Time: 1 reaction, which you take when an
Range: 30 feet
Components: V
Duration: Instantaneous
Description:
enemy makes an attack roll, ability check, or saving
throw
You call out a distracting epithet to a creature, worsening
its chance to succeed at whatever it’s doing. Roll a d4 and
subtract the number rolled from an attack roll, ability
check, or saving throw that the target has just made; the
target uses the lowered result to determine the outcome
of its roll.
=== SPELL END ===

=== SPELL START ===
Name: MASS SURGE DAMPENER
Level: 5
School: Abjuration
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 30 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 minute, or until expended
Description:
Using your strength of will, you protect up to three
creatures other than yourself from the effect of a chaos
magic surge. A protected creature can make a DC 13
Charisma saving throw to negate the effect of a chaos
magic surge that does not normally allow a saving throw,
or it gains advantage on a saving throw that is normally
allowed. Once a protected creature makes a successful
saving throw allowed by mass surge dampener, the spell’s
effect ends for that creature.
=== SPELL END ===

=== SPELL START ===
Name: MISFORTUNE
Level: 6
School: Necromancy
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S, M (a broken mirror)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Description:
You cast a pall of bad luck over all creatures in a 15-foot
radius centered on a point within range. Each creature
in that area must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or
be cursed with bad luck for the duration of the spell. A
creature under the effect of this spell has disadvantage on
all ability checks, saving throws, and attack rolls. A remove
curse spell ends this effect.
Special. If a targeted creature is carrying a stone of good
luck, the creature is unaffected by the spell, but the item
ceases to function for 24 hours. Likewise, if a targeted
creature is carrying a luck blade, the creature is unaffected
by the spell, but the sword’s Luck ability and saving throw
bonuses cease to function for 24 hours.
=== SPELL END ===

=== SPELL START ===
Name: MIST OF WONDERS
Level: 2
School: Conjuration
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self (30-foot radius)
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 minute
Description:
A colorful mist surrounds you out to a radius of 30 feet.
Creatures inside the mist see odd shapes in it and hear
random sounds that don’t make sense. The very concepts
of order and logic don’t seem to exist inside the mist.
Any 1st-level spell that’s cast in the mist by another caster
or that travels through the mist is affected by its strange
nature. The caster must make a Constitution saving
throw when casting the spell. On a failed save, the spell
transforms into another 1st-level spell the caster knows
(chosen by the GM from those available), even if that spell
is not currently prepared. The altered spell’s slot level or its
original target or targeted area can’t be changed. Cantrips
are unaffected. If (in the GM’s judgment) none of the
caster’s spells known of that level can be transformed, the
spell being cast simply fails.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
spell slot of 3rd level or higher, it affects any spell cast
using a spell slot of any lower level. For instance, using a
6th-level slot enables you to transform a spell of 5th level
or lower into another spell of the same level.
=== SPELL END ===

=== SPELL START ===
Name: PARAGON OF CHAOS
Level: 8
School: Transmutation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self
Components: V
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Description:
You become a humanoid-shaped swirling mass of color
and sound. You gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing,
and slashing damage, and immunity to poison and
psychic damage. You are also immune to the following
conditions: exhaustion, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned,
and unconscious. Finally, you gain truesight to 30 feet and
can teleport 30 feet as a move.
Each round, as a bonus action, you can cause an
automatic chaos magic surge, choosing either yourself or
another creature you can see within 60 feet as the caster
for the purpose of resolving the effect. You must choose
the target before rolling percentile dice to determine the
nature of the surge. The DC of any required saving throw
is calculated as if you were the caster.
=== SPELL END ===

=== SPELL START ===
Name: ROAMING PAIN
Level: 1
School: Necromancy
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 30 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Description:
You afflict a single humanoid within range with severe
pain in a random part of its body. Roll a d6 and consult the
table to determine the spell’s initial effect.
D
1 Head Incapacitated
2 Throat Unable to speak coherently or cast
spells with verbal components
3 Chest Cannot take reactions or bonus actions
4 Abdomen Disadvantage on Constitution saving
throws
5 Arm Disadvantage on attack rolls, Strength
and Dexterity skill checks
6 Leg Movement halved
The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On
a successful save, it is able to function despite the pain
and ignore the effects. At the start of the target’s turn each
round for the duration of the spell, roll again on the table
to see where the pain affects the target in that round.
=== SPELL END ===

=== SPELL START ===
Name: ROARING WINDS OF LIMBO
Level: 8
School: Conjuration
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 150 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Description:
You tear open a breach to the planes of chaos, and the
act of doing so fills an area with a dangerous windstorm.
The area consists of twelve 10-foot cubes, which you can
arrange as you wish. Each cube must have at least one face
in common with a face of another cube. Each creature
in the area is deafened, and any sound it makes cannot
be heard outside the area. The wind disperses all gases
and vapors and extinguishes all unprotected flames in
the area, and has a 75 percent chance of extinguishing
protected flames, such as lanterns. All Wisdom
(Perception) checks that rely on sight made by a creature
in the area have disadvantage due to the dust, grit, and
debris being cast about.
Each creature in the area must make a Strength saving
throw at the start of its turn. On a failed save, the creature
is pushed 15 feet in a random direction. (Roll a d8,
designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on
around the points of the compass.) The wind also hampers
movement; a creature in the area must spend 2 feet of
movement for every 1 foot it moves.
As a bonus action on each of your turns, you can bombard
up to twelve creatures in the area with flying debris, dealing
2d10 bludgeoning, 2d10 piercing, and 2d10 slashing
damage. A creature that makes a successful Dexterity
saving throw takes half the damage.
=== SPELL END ===

=== SPELL START ===
Name: SHIFTING THE ODDS
Level: 2
School: Divination
Casting Time: 1 bonus action
Range: Self
Components: V
Duration: Instantaneous
Description:
By wrapping yourself in strands of chaotic energy, you
gain advantage on the next attack roll or ability check that
you make. Fate is a cruel mistress, however, and her scales
must always be balanced. The second attack roll or ability
check (whichever occurs first) that you make after casting
shifting the odds is made with disadvantage.
=== SPELL END ===

=== SPELL START ===
Name: SURGE DAMPENER
Level: 3
School: Abjuration
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 minute, until expended
Description:
Using your strength of will, you cause one creature
other than yourself that you touch to become so firmly
entrenched within reality that it is protected from the
effects of a chaos magic surge. The protected creature can
make a DC 13 Charisma saving throw to negate the effect
of a chaos magic surge that does not normally allow a
saving throw, or it gains advantage on a saving throw that
is normally allowed. Once the protected creature makes
a successful saving throw allowed by surge dampener, the
spell ends.
=== SPELL END ===

Name: TIMELY DISTRACTION
Level: 2
School: Evocation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 25 feet
Components: V, S, M (a handful of sand or dirt thrown
Duration: 3 rounds
Description:
in the air)
You call forth a swirling, crackling wave of constantly
shifting pops, flashes, and swept-up debris. This chaos
can confound one creature. If the target gets a failure on a
Wisdom saving throw, roll a d4 and consult the following
table to determine the result. An affected creature can
repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns,
ending the effect on itself on a success. Otherwise, the
spell ends when its duration expires.
D
1 Blinded
2 Stunned
3 Deafened
4 Prone
D
1 A spindly third arm sprouts from your shoulder. As a bonus action, you can use it to attack with a light weapon. You
have advantage on Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) checks and any checks that require the manipulation of tools.
2 Your skin is covered by rough scales that increase your AC by 1 and give you resistance to a random damage type (roll
on the Damage Type table in the frenzied bolt spell description).
3 A puckered orifice grows on your back. You can forcefully expel air from it, granting you a flying speed of 30 feet.
You must land at the end of your turn. In addition, as a bonus action, you can try to push a creature away with a
blast of air. The target is pushed 5 feet away from you if it fails a Strength saving throw with a DC equal to 10 + your
Constitution modifier.
4 A second face appears on the back of your head. You gain darkvision out to a range of 120 feet and advantage on
sight-based and scent-based Wisdom (Perception) checks. You become adept at carrying on conversations with
yourself.
5 You grow gills that not only allow you to breathe underwater but also filter poison out of the air. You gain immunity
to inhaled poisons.
6 Your hindquarters elongate, and you grow a second set of legs. Your base walking speed increases by 10 feet, and your
carrying capacity becomes your Strength score multiplied by 20.
7 You become incorporeal and can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. You take
1d10 force damage if you end your turn inside an object. You can’t pick up or interact with physical objects that you
weren’t carrying when you became incorporeal.
8 Your limbs elongate and flatten into prehensile paddles. You gain a swimming speed equal to your base walking
speed and have advantage on Strength (Athletics) checks made to climb or swim. In addition, your unarmed strikes
deal 1d6 bludgeoning damage.
9 Your head fills with a light gas and swells to four times its normal size, causing your hair to fall out. You have
advantage on Intelligence and Wisdom ability checks and can levitate up to 5 feet above the ground.
10 You grow three sets of feathered wings that give you a flying speed equal to your walking speed and the ability to hover.

Name: UNCONTROLLABLE TRANSFORMATION
Level: 7
School: Transmutation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self
Components: V, S, M (the bill of a platypus)
Duration: 1 hour
Description:
You infuse your body with raw chaos and will it to
adopt a helpful mutation. Roll a d10 and consult
the Uncontrollable Transformation table below to
determine what mutation occurs. You can try to control
the shifting of your body to gain a mutation you prefer,
but doing so is taxing; you can roll a d10 twice and
choose the result you prefer, but you gain one level of
exhaustion. At the end of the spell, your body returns to
its normal form.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
spell slot of 8th level or higher, you gain an additional
mutation for each slot level above 7th. You gain one level
of exhaustion for each mutation you try to control.

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Description:
You unravel the bonds of reality that hold a suit of armor
together. A target wearing armor must succeed on a
Constitution saving throw or its armor softens to the
consistency of candle wax, decreasing the target’s AC by 2.
Undermine armor has no effect on creatures that aren’t
wearing armor.

Name: UNRULY ITEM
Level: 1
School: Transmutation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 30 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Description:
You animate an object in the possession of a creature
within range, giving the object limited movement and
a compulsion to thwart its possessor. The
effect of the spell varies depending on the
kind of object you affect.
Weapon: A weapon being wielded
by a creature fights and twists,
trying to free itself from
the creature’s grasp. The
creature must make a
Dexterity saving throw.
On a failed save, the
creature has disadvantage on
any attacks it makes in that round with
the weapon. On a save that fails by 5 or
more, the creature drops the weapon.
Armor: The creature’s armor shifts
and moves, becoming noisy and
uncomfortable. If the armor does
not normally impart disadvantage
on Dexterity (Stealth) checks,
it does so while this spell
is in effect. The creature
wearing it must succeed on
a Dexterity saving throw or
take a 10-foot penalty to
its speed and be unable to
use the Dash action.
Other Items: The effects on other carried items can
vary at the GM’s discretion. A potion might behave as
a weapon, trying not to be drunk, falling to the ground
and becoming ruined if the Dexterity save is failed by 5 or
more. A backpack might try to empty itself, disgorging a
random item each round on a failed save.

=== SPELL START ===
Name: UNSHACKLED MAGIC
Level: 9
School: Enchantment
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 120 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Description:
You designate a creature within range that has the
Spellcasting or Innate Spellcasting special trait and imbue
it with wild magic, causing it to lose control of its magical
ability. If the target gets a failure on a Charisma saving
throw, then on its next turn, it rolls randomly to select one
of its available spells. The target then spontaneously casts
that spell as an action. If the spell can be cast using a spell
slot higher than its level, roll randomly to determine what
slot is used to cast the spell. The target still determines
factors such as the location of the spell’s area or which
creatures it affects, as normal, but it is compelled to cast
that particular spell at that particular time.
Each round while this spell remains in effect, the target
makes another Charisma saving throw. On a successful
save, it can act normally in that round, but the unshackled
magic spell does not end.
=== SPELL END ===

=== SPELL START ===
Name: WILD SHIELD
Level: 4
School: Abjuration
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 minute
Description:
You surround yourself with the forces of chaos. Wild lights
and strange sounds engulf you, making stealth impossible.
While wild shield is active, you can use a reaction to repel
a spell of 4th level or lower that targets you or whose area
you are within. A repelled spell has no effect on you, but
doing this causes the chance of a chaos magic surge as if
you had cast a spell, with you considered the caster for any
effect of the surge.
Wild shield ends when the duration expires or
when it absorbs 4 levels of spells. If you try to
repel a spell whose level exceeds the number
of levels remaining, make an ability check
using your spellcasting ability. The DC
equals 10 + the spell’s level – the number of
levels wild shield can still repel. If the check
succeeds, the spell is repelled; if the check
fails, the spell has its full effect. The chance of a
chaos magic surge exists regardless of whether
the spell is repelled.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell
using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can repel one
additional spell level for each slot level above 4th.

=== SPELL START ===
Name: WILD TRAJECTORY
Level: 7
School: Transmutation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 100 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Description:
You create a 30-foot cube of magical instability that
causes spell effects passing through it to diverge wildly
from their original paths. When a spell with a visible or
tangible manifestation (such as fireball, lightning bolt, or a
ray or projectile such as magic missile or ray of frost) passes
through the area, roll a d8. On a 1, the spell continues on
its original path or toward its original target; on a 2, it
diverts 45 degrees to the right; on a 3, it diverts 90 degrees
to the right; on a 4, it diverts 135 degrees to the right; on a
5, it turns 180 degrees, back the way it came (striking the
caster if it is a targeted spell); on a 6, the spell diverts 45
degrees to the left; on a 7, it diverts 90 degrees to the left;
on an 8, it diverts 135 degrees to the left.
A spell that affects anything in its path, such as lightning
bolt, continues to do so along its new trajectory, up to
the limit of its range. A fireball spell will travel in the new
direction up to the limit of its range before detonating.
A targeted spell will strike the first viable target it
encounters along its new trajectory.
Wizards who specialize in chaos magic crave an
understanding of probability and life’s unpredictable
outcomes to the point of obsession.
What starts as an attempt to analyze the patterns of chaos
quickly becomes a trip down the rabbit hole to madness.
How to Start: If you’re a wizard who wants to become an
entropist, you make that decision upon reaching 2nd level,
when you are also entitled to choose an arcane tradition. If
you decide to follow the path of the entropist exclusively,
you can forego the selection of an arcane tradition and
gain the features of the entropist specialty instead.
You can also pursue the entropist specialty in
conjunction with one of the standard arcane traditions.
If you choose to do this, you gain the Savant feature of
your chosen school in addition to Chaos Magic Savant
(described below). Also at 2nd level, you choose whether
to gain Long Odds (see below) or the 2nd-level feature
of your chosen school.
Thereafter, at 6th, 10th,
and 14th level, you choose
between the lowest-level
features still available. For
instance, a transmuter might
select Minor Alchemy at
2nd level and Long Odds at
6th level, followed by either
Transmuter’s Stone or Twisted
Arcana at 10th level.
Beginning when you take up this
specialty at 2nd level, the gold and time you
must spend to copy a chaos spell into your
spellbook is halved.
Also starting at 2nd level, you can manipulate
the reality-changing forces of chaos to alter the
odds in a situation. You can use a bonus action
to give yourself, or a reaction to give a
creature you can see, advantage on one attack roll, saving
throw, or ability check made during this turn. Using this
feature causes a chaos magic surge. You must finish a long
rest before you can use this feature again.
Starting at 6th level, when you cast a spell that deals
damage, you can infuse the effect with greater power by
channeling chaos through yourself. You make this choice
after determining that the spell has been successfully cast
(by making a spell attack roll) but before rolling damage.
If you decide to use this feature, roll a d6 + 1; this is the
maximum number of your spell’s
damage dice you can reroll.
You can reroll any number of damage dice up to that
maximum, and you must use the rerolled results.
In addition, the type of damage your spell deals is
replaced randomly. Use the Random Damage Type table
to determine the spell’s new damage type.
D
1 Acid
2 Cold
3 Fire
4 Force
5 Lightning
6 Necrotic
7 Poison
8 Psychic
9 Radiant
10 Thunder
Using this feature has a chance of causing a chaos magic
surge. You must finish a long rest before you can use this
feature again.
Beginning at 10th level, when you cast a chaos spell, you
gain resistance to a random damage type for a number of
rounds equal to 1 + your Intelligence modifier (minimum
of 1). You can try to narrow the spell’s focus to a damage
type you prefer, but doing so has an element of risk; you
can roll twice on the Random Damage Type table and
choose the result you prefer, but you must also roll to see
if a chaos magic surge occurs. You must finish a long rest
before you can use this feature again.
Starting at 14th level, anytime you cause a chaos magic
surge, you regain one use of Long Odds, Twisted Arcana,
or Shifting Resistance without needing to finish a long
rest. In addition, every time you cast a chaos spell, you gain
temporary hit points equal to your Intelligence modifier +
the spell’s level.
Bards of the College of Entropy are itinerant gamblers
and daring thrill-seekers whose actions are supremely
unpredictable.
Rather than relying on ancient lore or skill with arms,
these bards throw themselves into new challenges just to
see what happens, trusting in luck to see them through.
They’re sometimes called luck stealers (with a mixture of
derision and respect), because no matter how bad things
get for everyone around them, these bards always seem to
come out unscathed.
When you join the College of Entropy at 3rd level,
you gain proficiency in Acrobatics and Athletics and
proficiency with a gaming set of your choice.
Also at 3rd level, you learn to borrow a little bit of
other people’s luck for yourself. When a creature
that you can see within 60 feet is about to make an
attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw with
advantage, you can use a reaction and expend
one of your uses of Bardic Inspiration. If you
do so, that creature takes a penalty to its die
roll equal to the number you roll on your
Bardic Inspiration die.
After the creature’s attack roll, ability check, or saving
throw is resolved, you gain the benefit of that Bardic
Inspiration die, which is usable only on yourself and lasts
only for a number of rounds equal to the roll of the Bardic
Inspiration die. If you do not use the benefit before that
time, it is lost.
For example, if you roll a 5 on your Bardic Inspiration
die, the creature takes a -5 penalty to its roll. You can
then apply a +5 bonus to one attack roll, ability check,
or saving throw that you make within the next 5
rounds.
Stealing luck, regardless of whether you use
the Bardic Inspiration benefit, causes a chance of a
chaos magic surge.
At 6th level, whenever you cast a chaos spell, you have a
chance of causing a chaos magic surge, and you regain one
use of your Bardic Inspiration. You regain the use of this
feature after you finish a short or long rest.
Everything desires to be something else. Starting at 14th
level, as an action, you can exchange one bard spell you
know for another bard spell of the same level or a lower
one. At the end of your next turn, your list of known
spells returns to normal. Using this ability has a chance of
causing a chaos magic surge.
D
1–2 You cast hypnotic pattern centered on yourself.
3–4 The target of your spell or ability is also targeted by an enlarge spell. If your spell or ability has no target, the
enlarge spell affects you.
5–6 An angry constrictor snake controlled by the GM appears wrapped around your waist.
7–8 For 10 rounds, a gust of wind spell blows out from you in all directions.
9–10 Three targets you can see within 60 feet chosen by you are targeted by a ray of frost cantrip.
11–12 You rise 30 feet into the air and hover there until the start of your next turn, when you fall.
13–14 You grow a purple mustache 3d6 inches in length.
15–16 You are cloaked in shadow and reek of brimstone for 1 hour. During that time, you have advantage on
Charisma (Intimidation) checks and disadvantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks.
17–18 You summon a mule 100 feet above the target of your spell or ability. If your spell or ability has no target, the
mule appears above you. Both the mule and the creature it lands on take 10d6 bludgeoning damage from the
inevitable fall, or the creature under the mule takes no damage with a successful Dexterity saving throw; the
DC is equal to your spell save DC.
19–20 You cast contact other plane.
21–22 Rum rains from the sky in a 30-foot radius around you for 10 rounds.
23–24 You regain your highest-level expended spell slot.
25–26 You cast a hemispherical wall of force, centered on yourself.
27–28 All your hair falls out. It grows back at the normal rate.
29–30 You gain resistance to one type of damage, determined randomly, for 1 hour.
31–32 Loud horns that can be heard for a mile sound for 1 hour. The sound moves with you.
33–34 Until you finish a long rest, every word you utter sounds normal to you but is heard by others as
incomprehensible babbling. This effect doesn’t impair your ability to cast spells.
35–36 Three creatures within 30 feet that you can see are targeted by a bolt of light that does 1d8 radiant damage.
Each target can avoid the damage with a successful Constitution saving throw.
37–38 Every creature within 60 feet of you, except you, teleports 10 feet in a random direction. If the destination is
a solid object or hazardous terrain, the creature doesn't move.
39–40 The sun (or the moon, at night) is eclipsed for 10 minutes.
41–42 You become immune to all damage for 1 round.
43–44 Until you finish a long rest, you leave burning footprints that smolder in your wake for 5 rounds. The flames
are hot enough to ignite easily flammable material.
45–46 You turn into a succulent cooked ham for 10 rounds. While a ham, you are incapacitated and have
vulnerability to all damage. The gold plate that you appear upon can be sold for 5 gp.
47–48 For 30 feet around you, the ground turns into broken, uneven, difficult terrain.
49–50 For 1 hour, you gain a bonus to weapon damage equal to your spellcasting ability modifier.
The use of chaos magic sometimes causes a chaos magic
surge. This phenomenon is similar to the wild magic
surge caused by some sorcerers. When a chaos magic
surge has a chance of occurring, the caster rolls a d20.
On a 1, roll percentile dice and consult the Chaos Magic
Surge table to determine the result.
51–52 You open a portal to the Abyss that stays open for 10 rounds. Each round there is a 1 in 20 chance that a fiend
or other Abyssal creature of the GM’s choice walks through.
53–54 You cast healing word on a target of your choice.
55–56 Your eyes turn into potatoes and fall from their sockets. You are blinded until you receive a remove curse or
regenerate spell.
57–58 You hear a thunderous sound and are stunned until the end of your next turn.
59–60 You cast moonbeam.
61–62 An item you hold is covered in a continual flame effect. If you are not holding an item, the GM chooses an item
within 30 feet of you to be the target.
63–64 You and two targets that you can see within 30 feet are affected by a bane spell.
65–66 You gain advantage on your next attack roll, ability check, or saving throw within 24 hours.
67–68 You have disadvantage on your next attack roll, ability check, or saving throw within 24 hours.
69–70 Choose a creature that you can see within 60 feet (other than yourself) to gain temporary hit points equal to
your level.
71–72 A barrel of lamp oil appears adjacent to you.
73–74 You are targeted by a disguise self spell making you appear as a dirt-covered human child of the opposite
gender.
75–76 Dim pink light fills an area 30 feet around your target. If your spell or ability has no target, the light is
centered on you.
77–78 You summon a boar to a space you can see within 30 feet. The boar follows your commands for 1 minute and
then disappears. It is wearing a green dress.
79–80 You cast flame strike centered on yourself.
81–82 You gain 1d4 × 10 pounds of weight.
83–84 You gain a +2 bonus to your AC for a number of rounds equal to your spellcasting ability modifier.
85–86 The ground beneath your target, or beneath you if your spell or ability has no target, sinks 1 foot. The target
also falls prone unless it makes a successful Dexterity saving throw.
87–88 Red silk scarves and origami cranes swirl through the air within 500 feet of you, causing the area to be
obscured. The scarves are worth 100 gp if collected and sold.
89–90 A table with a heroes’ feast effect on it appears 10 feet from you.
91–92 Three skeletons under the control of the GM claw their way out of the ground and attack random living
creatures until they are destroyed.
93–94 You cast barkskin on yourself. Your hair is permanently replaced with green leaves until you receive a remove
curse spell or comparable magic.
95–96 Your teeth turn into moths and fly away.
97–98 You sprout insect wings, giving you a flying speed of 30 feet. The wings last for 1 minute.
99–00 A weapon you can see within 30 feet glows and becomes a +1 weapon for 1 minute.
Some scholars believe that true magic springs only from
deep inside an individual creature, such as a dragon or
a demon, and those possessing bloodlines from such
terrible creatures can tap their personal magical stores.
Others speculate that magic comes only from other planes
of existence or from the gods themselves.
The truth is that magic comes from several sources, and
powerful beings can utilize any wellspring of magic to
craft spells and fuel seemingly miraculous effects. One
of the first creatures to master all types of magic were the
majestic and terrible dragons. Although they were capable
of controlling the elements and inducing terrible fear, they
also mastered more subtle magic. They wove a tapestry of
magic into their homes, giving their lairs innate defenses.
They taught their servants, from humans to kobolds to
elves, how to make use of the magic that permeated the
atmosphere. And they also passed on to their kin—both
true dragons and lesser creatures—the kind of magic that
roiled in blood and bone.
Dragon magic is a distinct branch of arcane study,
founded in the Draconic language and in an elemental
understanding of arcane forces.

=== SPELL END ===

=== SPELL START ===
Name: ASPECT OF THE DRAGON
Level: 7
School: Transmutation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self
Components: V, S, M (a dragon scale)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Description:
This spell draws out the ancient nature within your blood,
allowing you to assume the form of any dragon-type
creature of challenge 10 or less.
You assume the hit points and Hit Dice of the new form.
When you revert to your normal form, you return to the
number of hit points you had before you transformed.
If you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any
excess damage carries over to your normal form. As long
as the excess damage doesn’t reduce your normal form to
0 hit points, you aren’t knocked unconscious.
You retain the benefits of any features from your class,
race, or other source and can use them, provided that your
new form is physically capable of doing so. You can speak
only if the dragon can normally speak.
When you transform, you choose whether your
equipment falls to the ground, merges into the new form,
or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions normally, but
equipment doesn’t change shape or size to match the new
form. Any equipment that the new form can’t wear must
either fall to the ground or merge into the new form. The
GM has final say on whether the new form can wear or use
a particular piece of equipment. Equipment that merges
has no effect in that state.

Name: CATCH THE BREATH
Level: 3
School: Transmutation
Casting Time: 1 reaction, which you take when you
Range: Self
Components: V
Duration: Instantaneous
Description:
make a saving throw against a breath weapon attack
You can cast this spell as a reaction when you’re targeted
by a breath weapon. Doing so gives you advantage on your
saving throw against the breath weapon. If your saving
throw succeeds, you take no damage from the attack even
if a successful save normally only halves the damage.
Whether your saving throw succeeded or failed, you
absorb and store energy from the attack. On your next
turn, you can make a ranged spell attack against a target
within 60 feet. On a hit, the target takes 3d10 force
damage. If you opt not to make this attack, the stored
energy dissipates harmlessly.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage done by your
attack increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 3rd.
CAVE DRAGON’S DOMINANCE
=== SPELL END ===

=== SPELL START ===
Name: CAVE DRAGON’S DOMINANCE
Level: 6
School: Transmutation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Description:
You take on some of the physical characteristics and
abilities of the cave dragon, growing protective scales and
claws. Until the spell ends, your AC can’t be lower than
16, regardless of what kind of armor you are wearing.
You gain blindsight out to a range of 60 feet. You can
take two actions on your turn to attack with your claws,
dealing 1d6 slashing damage on a hit. You have resistance
to poison damage. Up to three times while the spell is
active, as an action, you can breathe a 20-foot cone of
poison gas, dealing 6d8 poison damage to each creature
in the cone and making it poisoned until it finishes a long
or short rest. A creature that succeeds on a Constitution
saving throw takes half as much damage from your breath
weapon and is not poisoned. Finally, you gain a climbing
speed of 40 feet.

=== SPELL START ===
Name: CLAIM LAIR
Level: 6
School: Abjuration
Casting Time: 10 minutes
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M (material goods and wealth worth
Duration: 24 hours
Description:
at least 2,000 gp)
By placing your personal wealth within an area and
invoking the dragon’s territorial nature, you claim the
area as your lair, imbuing you with extra power within its
confines. You can claim an area of up to 2,500 square feet
(a space 50 feet square, or one hundred 5-foot squares, or
twenty-five 10-foot squares). The claimed area can be up
to 20 feet tall and shaped as you desire. While within these
confines, you can take one of the following lair actions
once per round on initiative count 20:
• Magical darkness spreads from a point you choose
within 30 feet, filling a 15-foot-radius sphere until you
dismiss it as an action, use this lair action again, or
die. The darkness spreads around corners. A creature
with darkvision can’t see through this darkness, and
nonmagical light can’t illuminate it, but you can see in
the area as if it were brightly lit. If any of the effect’s area
overlaps with an area of light created by a spell of 2nd
level or lower, the spell that created the light is dispelled.
• Part of the ceiling collapses above one creature you can
see within 60 feet of you. The creature must succeed on
a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC or
take 3d6 bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone
and buried. A buried target is restrained and unable to
breathe or stand up. A creature can take an action to
make a DC 10 Strength check, ending the buried state
with a success.
• A tremor shakes the lair in a 30-foot radius around you.
Each creature on the ground in that area other than you
must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against your
spell save DC or be knocked prone.
You can take an action to dismiss this spell.

=== SPELL START ===
Name: CLAWS OF THE EARTH DRAGON
Level: 5
School: Evocation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V
Duration: Instantaneous
Description:
You summon the power of the earth dragon and shoot a
ray at one target within 60 feet. The target falls prone and
takes 6d8 bludgeoning damage from being slammed to
the ground. If the target was flying or levitating, it takes
an additional 1d6 bludgeoning damage per 10 feet it falls.
If the target makes a successful Strength saving throw,
damage is halved, it doesn’t fall, and it isn’t knocked prone.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell
slot of 6th level or higher, the damage done by the attack
increases by 1d8 and the range increases by 10 feet for each
slot level above 5th.

Name: CONVERSE WITH DRAGON
Level: 1
School: Divination
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self
Components: V
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
Description:
You gain limited telepathy, allowing you to communicate
with any creature within 120 feet of you that has the
dragon type, regardless of the creature’s languages. A
dragon can choose to make a Charisma saving throw to
prevent telepathic contact with itself.
This spell doesn’t change a dragon’s disposition
toward you or your allies, it only opens a channel of
communication. In some cases, unwanted telepathic
contact can worsen the dragon’s attitude toward you.

Name: DEADLY STING
Level: 8
School: Transmutation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self
Components: V, S, M (a thorn)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Description:
You grow a 10-foot-long tail as supple as a whip, tipped
with a horrible stinger. During the spell’s duration, you
can use the stinger to make a melee spell attack with a
reach of 10 feet. On a hit, the target takes 1d4 piercing
damage plus 4d10 poison damage, and a creature must
make a successful Constitution saving throw or become
vulnerable to poison damage for the duration of the spell.

=== SPELL START ===
Name: DETECT DRAGONS
Level: 2
School: Divination
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
Description:
You can detect the presence of dragons and other
draconic creatures within your line of sight and 120
feet, regardless of disguises, illusions, and alteration
magic such as polymorph. The information you uncover
depends on the number of consecutive rounds you spend
an action studying a subject or area. On the first round of
examination, you detect whether any draconic creatures
are present, but not their number, location, identity, or
type. On the second round, you learn the number of such
creatures as well as the general condition of the most
powerful one. On the third and subsequent rounds, you
make a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check; if it succeeds,
you learn the age, type, and location of one draconic
creature. Note that the spell provides no information on
the turn in which it is cast, unless you have the means to
take a second action that turn.
