A special thanks to the 4,456 backers who made this volume possible!  Thanks also to the playtesters who kept 
us sharp, the fans who wrote in with questions for clarification, and the designers of some of these spells in prior 
editions of the game going back to the dawn of Zobeck and the ticking pendulum.

Introduction
My first spell-slinger was a cleric of Thor who was more 
about crushing the enemy than healing the wounded. Choosing which spells he would be able to cast was a thrill from the very beginning. Plus, announcing each spell with a shout of praise for thunder and lightning felt, well, extremely metal. I was 12, and casting spells was the best part of playing D&D.
Not that much has changed. This Deep Magic collection 
offers more than 700 new spells for your character or your campaign’s NPCs to enhance the richness of your adventures. That’s 700 new ways to explore, explode, manipulate, disintegrate, and master the fantasy campaign of your choice. When you add in the subclasses, domains, and appendices, you’ll see that this collection broadens the scope of what spells can accomplish. If you enjoy magic in its endless variety, this book is a treasure trove of possibilities. 
The Deep Magic series for 5th Edition started in 2016 
and has expanded to twenty-some installments since then; these are updated, revised, and collected here together with almost 200 all-new spells, plus material collected from the Warlock Patreon booklets, T ales of the Old Margreve, Empire of the Ghouls, and other sources. T opped off by the best spells submitted by Kickstarter backers, this volume offers you a rich collection of particular styles of magic as well as everyday, highly useful spells for any caster. In its wide-ranging approach, it also includes spells designed expressly for villains and variations on three 
traditional spells dating from the earliest days of the game. 
This book will inspire you, spark encounters and 
nefarious plots, and give your hero new tools to outsmart 
and outfight the monstrous foes that await in any dungeon. 
This volume enables all that and more.  
Go forth and make magic!

SPELL LISTSThe spells in Deep Magic for 5th Edition are all listed here, 
and the great majority of the spells listed are found in the spell descriptions detailed in the section after this one. A spell whose entry in the lists ends with a term in brackets (such as [chaos] or [dragon] or [Void]) is found in a separate section devoted to that category and its traditions and quirks.
A spell whose entry ends with “[clockwork]” is an 
example of clockwork magic, which is an integral part of the Midgard Campaign Setting. The appendix of this book presents clockwork magic spell lists for each class capable of using such magic
Similarly, a spell whose entry ends with “[labyrinth]” 
belongs to a small group of rare spells collectively known as labyrinth magic. The appendix presents labyrinth magic spell lists for each class capable of using such magic.Spell Lists

SPELL DESCRIPTIONSThis section contains more than four hundred spells
designed for use by player characters and NPCs. The spell descriptions are presented in alphabetical order.


ABHORRENCE
Enchantment cantrip
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 30 feetComponents: V , SDuration: 1 minute


Y ou temporarily make a creature within range less
appealing to others. The target makes a Wisdom saving throw against your spell. On a successful save, the spell is ineffective. On a failed save, the next time the creature makes a Charisma check before the spell ends, roll a d6 and subtract the result from the roll. The spell then ends.ABHORRENT APPARITION
4th-level illusion
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 60 feetComponents: M (a gourd with a face carved on it)Duration: Instantaneous


Y ou imbue a terrifying visage onto a gourd and toss it
ahead of you to a spot of your choosing within range. Each creature within 15 feet of that spot takes 6d8 psychic damage and becomes frightened of you for 1 minute; a successful Wisdom saving throw halves the damage and negates the fright. A creature frightened in this way repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
At Higher Levels. If you cast this spell using a spell slot 
of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 4th.

SPELL DESCRIPTIONSABSORBING FIELD
6th-level abjuration
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: SelfComponents: V , SDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute


Y ou cloak yourself in a protective field that absorbs
incoming magic, rejuvenating your spell slots. When you 
are the target of a spell (including spells that affect multiple 
targets, but not area spells such as fireball), make an ability check using your spellcasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the spell’s level. On a successful check, the spell has no 
effect on you and is absorbed by the field. Y ou regain a spell 
slot of the same level as the spell that was cast against you. If you have no expended spell slots of that level, you don’t regain a spell slot, but this spell remains in effect.
Even if the spell manages to bypass the field, you gain 
advantage on your saving throw.


ACUMEN
Transmutation cantrip
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: T ouchComponents: V , SDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Y ou touch a willing creature. Once before the spell ends, 
the target can roll a d6 and add the result to one Wisdom check of its choice. It can roll the die before or after making the check. The spell then ends.


ADJUST POSITION
1st-level transmutation
Casting Time: 1 bonus actionRange: 30 feetComponents: VDuration: Instantaneous


Y ou adjust the location of an ally to a better tactical
position. Y ou move one willing creature within range 5 feet. This movement does not provoke opportunity attacks. The creature moves bodily through the intervening space (as opposed to teleporting), so there can be no physical obstacle (such as a wall or a door) in the path.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using 
a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can target an additional willing creature for each slot level above 1st.AGONIZING MARK
1st-level evocation
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 90 feetComponents: SDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute


Y ou choose a creature you can see within range to mark
as your prey, and a ray of black energy issues forth from you. Until the spell ends, each time you deal damage to the target it must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, it falls prone as its body is filled with torturous agony.


ALE-DRITCH BLAST
Conjuration cantrip
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 60 feetComponents: V , SDuration: Instantaneous


A stream of ice-cold ale blasts from your outstretched
hands toward a creature or object within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, it takes 1d8 cold damage and it must make a successful Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the end of its next turn. A targeted creature has disadvantage on the saving throw if it has drunk any alcohol within the last hour.
The damage increases when you reach higher levels: 2d8 
at 5th level, 3d8 at 11th level, and 4d8 at 17th level.


ALLURE
Transmutation cantrip
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: T ouchComponents: V , SDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Y ou touch a willing creature. Once before the spell ends, 
the target can roll a d6 and add the result to one Charisma check of its choice. It can roll the die before or after making the check. The spell then ends.


ALLY AEGIS
6th-level abjuration
Casting Time: 1 reaction, which you take when your 
ally is hit by an attack or is targeted by a spell that deals 
damage other than psychic damage
Range: 60 feet
Components: V , SDuration: 1 round
When you see an ally within range in imminent danger, 
you can use your reaction to protect that creature with a 
35
SPELL DESCRIPTIONSshield of magical force. Until the start of your next turn, 
your ally has a +5 bonus to AC and is immune to force damage. In addition, if your ally must make a saving throw against an enemy’s spell that deals damage, the ally takes half as much damage on a failed saving throw and no damage on a successful save. Ally aegis offers no protection, however, against psychic damage from any source.
At Higher Levels.


When you cast this spell using a spell
slot of 7th level or higher, you can target one additional ally 
for each slot level above 6th.


ALONE
3rd-level enchantment
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 30 feetComponents: V , SDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute


Y ou cause a creature within range to believe its allies
have been banished to a different realm. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw, or it treats its allies as if they were invisible and silenced. The affected creature cannot target, perceive, or otherwise interact with its allies for the duration of the spell. If one of its allies hits it with a melee attack, the affected creature can make another Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the spell ends.
ALTER ARROW’S FORTUNE
1st-level divination
Casting Time: 1 reaction, which you take when an 
enemy makes a ranged attack that hits
Range: 100 feetComponents: SDuration: Instantaneous
Y ou clap your hands, setting off a chain of tiny events that 
culminate in throwing off an enemy’s aim. When an enemy makes a ranged attack with a weapon or a spell that hits one of your allies, this spell causes the enemy to reroll the attack roll unless the enemy makes a successful Charisma saving throw. The attack is resolved using the lower of the two rolls (effectively giving the enemy disadvantage on the attack).


ALTHEA'S TRAVEL TENT
2nd-level conjuration (ritual)
Casting Time: 5 minutesRange: T ouchComponents: V , S, M (a canvas tent)Duration: 8 hours
Y ou touch an ordinary, properly pitched canvas tent to 
create a space where you and a companion can sleep in comfort. From the outside, the tent appears normal, but inside it has a small foyer and a larger bedchamber. The foyer contains a writing desk with a chair; the bedchamber holds a soft bed large enough to sleep two, a small nightstand with a candle, and a small clothes rack. The floor of both rooms is a clean, dry, hard-packed version of the local ground. When the spell ends, the tent and the ground return to normal, and any creatures inside the tent are expelled to the nearest unoccupied spaces.
At Higher Levels. When the spell is cast using a 3rd-
level slot, the foyer becomes a dining area with seats for six and enough floor space for six people to sleep, if they bring their own bedding. The sleeping room is unchanged. With a 4th-level slot, the temperature inside the tent is comfortable regardless of the outside temperature, and the dining area includes a small kitchen. With a 5th-level slot, an unseen servant is conjured to prepare and serve food (from your supplies). With a 6th-level slot, a third room is added that has three two-person beds.

falling

this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can create one additional rope for every two slot levels above 1st. Each rope must be attached to a different creature.

37


SPELL DESCRIPTIONSsingle question for spirits more than one thousand years
dead. The ancient shade knows only what it knew in life, including languages. Answers are usually brief, cryptic, or repetitive, and the corpse is under no compulsion to offer a truthful answer if you are hostile to it or it recognizes you as an enemy. This spell doesn’t return the creature’s soul to its body, only its animating spirit. Thus, the corpse can’t learn new information, doesn’t comprehend anything that has happened since it died, and can’t speculate about future events
.


ANIMAL SPY
2nd-level divination
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 30 feetComponents: V , SDuration: 1 hour


Y ou create a mental link between you and a beast within
range. Until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action to transfer your awareness to the beast—using its vision,
 
hearing, smell, taste, and touch—and another bonus action 
on any subsequent turn to return your awareness 
to your body. Y ou can use an action to dismiss the spell entirely
. 
This spell affects normal beasts, including giant versions 
of animals, but not conjured animals or familiars. The spell does not allow you to control the beast or make it friendly to you. While you experience the world through the beast’s senses, your body is motionless, unaware of the outside world and effectively unconscious.


The spell ends if the distance between you and the beast
is ever greater than 1 mile, or if the beast is killed. If you are using the beast’s senses when it is killed, you must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be stunned for 1d4 rounds from the shock of experiencing its death.

Casting Time: 1 actionRange: T ouchComponents: V , S, M (piece of rotting flesh and an onyx 
gemstone worth 100 gp)

Y ou raise one Medium or Small humanoid corpse as a
ghoul under your control. Any class levels or abilities the creature had in life are gone, replaced by the standard ghoul stat block.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 
3rd-level spell slot, it can be used on the corpse of a Large humanoid to create a Large ghoul. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, this spell creates a ghast, but the material component changes to an onyx gemstone worth at least 200 gp.


ANIMATE GREATER UNDEAD
6th-level necromancy
Casting Time: 1 hourRange: 15 feetComponents: V , S, M (a pint of blood, a pound of 
flesh, and an ounce of bone dust, all of which the spell 
consumes)
Duration: Instantaneous


Animate greater undead creates an undead servant from
a pile of bones or from the corpse of a Large or Huge humanoid within range. The spell imbues the target with a foul mimicry of life, raising it as an undead skeleton or zombie. A skeleton uses the stat block of a minotaur skeleton, or a zombie uses the stat block of an ogre zombie, unless a more appropriate stat block is available.
The creature is under your control for 24 hours, after 
which it stops obeying your commands. T o maintain control of the creature for another 24 hours, you must cast this spell on it again while you have it controlled. Casting the spell for this purpose reasserts your control over up to four creatures you have previously animated rather than animating a new one.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 
spell slot of 7th level or higher, you can reanimate one additional creature for each slot level above 6th.


ANIMATED OBJECT SWARM
5th-level conjuration
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 120 feetComponents: V , SDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Myriad Tiny objects animate at your command, forming 
a swarm. The objects’ abilities conform to the rules stated in the animate objects spell, except that you animate only Tiny objects, which gather together into a Medium swarm.

SPELL DESCRIPTIONSANIMATED SCROLL
Transmutation cantrip
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: T ouchComponents: V , S, M (intricately folded paper or 
parchment)
Duration: 24 hours


The paper or parchment must be folded into the shape
of an animal before casting the spell. It then becomes an animated paper animal of the kind the folded paper most closely resembles. The creature uses the stat block of any beast that has a challenge rating of 0. It is made of paper, not flesh and bone, but it can do anything the real creature can do: a paper owl can fly and attack with its talons, a paper frog can swim without disintegrating in water, and so forth. It follows your commands to the best of its ability, including carrying messages to a recipient whose location you know.
The duration increases by 24 hours at 5th level (48 
hours), 11th level (72 hours), and 17th level (96 hours).


ARCANE PARASITE
7th-level transmutation (ritual)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: SelfComponents: V , SDuration: 2 hours


This spell creates a link between you and a nearby source
of arcane power, allowing you to draw on its strength to bolster your spellcasting ability. When you cast a spell, you can use a bonus action to draw on the link. Doing so means you expend no spell slots to cast the spell, the energy instead comes from the external power. 
The more you draw on the link, the harder it is to 
maintain. Each spell you cast in this manner decreases the duration of the arcane parasite spell by 10 minutes per level of the spell you cast using the link. For example, if you cast a fireball spell using the link, you would not expend a spell slot in the casting, but the duration of this spell would decrease by 30 minutes. If you cast a spell using the link and your remaining duration is equal to or less than the spell’s level × 10 minutes, then this spell ends as soon as that spell is cast.ARCANE SIGHT
8th-level divination
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: T ouchComponents: V , S, M (a piece of clear quartz)Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour


The recipient of this spell gains the benefits of both true

AS YOU WERE
2nd-level necromancy
Casting Time: 1 minuteRange: T ouchComponents: V , S, M (a piece of flesh from a creature of 
the target’s race)
Duration: Instantaneous
When cast on a dead or undead body, as you were returns 
that creature to the appearance it had in life while it was healthy and uninjured. The target must have a physical body; the spell fails if the target is normally noncorporeal.
If as you were is cast on a corpse, its effect is identical to 
that of gentle repose, except that the corpse’s appearance is 
restored to that of a healthy, uninjured (albeit dead) person.
If the target is an undead creature, it also is restored to 
the appearance it had in life, even if it died from disease or from severe wounds, or centuries ago. The target looks, smells, and sounds (if it can speak) as it did in life. Friends and family can tell something is wrong only with a successful Wisdom (Insight) check against your spell save 
DC, and only if they have reason to be suspicious. 
(Knowing that the person should be dead is sufficient reason.)
 Spells and abilities that detect undead are also 
fooled, but the creature remains susceptible to T urn 
Undead as normal .
This spell doesn’t confer the ability to speak on undead 
that normally can’t speak. The creature eats, drinks, and breathes as a living creature does; it can mimic sleep, but it has no more need for it than it had before.


The effect lasts for a number of hours equal to your
caster level. Y ou can use an action to end the spell early.Any amount of radiant or necrotic damage dealt to the creature, or any effect that reduces its Constitution, also ends the spell.
If this spell is cast on an undead creature that isn’t your 
ally or under your control, it makes a Charisma saving throw to resist the effect.

and receive a vision of one significant event that occurred in the area while the fire was burning. For example, if you were to touch the cold embers of a campfire, you might witness a snippet of a conversation that occurred around the fire. Similarly, touching the ashes of a burned letter might grant you a vision of the person who destroyed the letter or the contents of the letter.

will and determination from creatures, making them unable to act. Any creature within 20 feet of you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be unable to take actions, reactions, or bonus actions on its turn, except for the Disengage action.

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour
Y ou alert a number of creatures that you are familiar with, 
up to your spellcasting ability modifier (minimum of 1), of your intent to communicate with them through spiritual projection. The invitation can extend any distance and even cross to other planes of existence. Once notified, the creatures can choose to accept this communication at any time during the duration of the spell. 
41
SPELL DESCRIPTIONSWhen a creature accepts, its spirit is projected into 
one of the gems used in casting the spell. The material 
body it leaves behind falls unconscious and doesn't need food or air. The creature's consciousness is present in the room with you, and its normal form appears as an astral projection within 5 feet of the gem its spirit occupies. Y ou can see and hear all the creatures who have joined in the assembly, and they can see and hear you and each other as if they were present (which they are, astrally). They can't interact with anything physically.


A creature can end the spell's effect on itself voluntarily at
any time, as can you. When the effect ends or the duration expires, a creature's spirit returns to its body and it regains consciousness. A creature that withdraws voluntarily from the assembly can't rejoin it even if the spell is still active. If a gem is broken while occupied by a creature's astral self, the spirit in the gem returns to its body and the creature suffers two levels of exhaustion.


AWAKEN OBJECT
8th-level transmutation
Casting Time: 8 hoursRange: T ouchComponents: V , S, M (a ruby worth at least 1,000 gp, 
which the spell consumes)
Duration: Permanent


After spending the casting time enchanting a ruby along
with a Large or smaller nonmagical object in humanoid form, you touch the ruby to the object. The ruby dissolves into the object, which becomes a living construct imbued with sentience. If the object has no face, a humanoid face appears on it in an appropriate location. The awakened object's statistics are determined by its size, as shown on the table below. An awakened object can use an action to make a melee weapon attack against a target within 5 feet of it. It has free will, acts independently, and speaks one language you know. It is initially friendly to anyone who assisted in its creation.
An awakened object's speed is 30 feet. If it has no 
apparent legs or other means of moving, it gains a flying speed of 30 feet and it can hover. Its sight and hearing are equivalent to a typical human's senses. Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma can be adjusted up or down by the GM to fit unusual circumstances. A beautiful statue might awaken with increased Charisma, for example, or the bust of a great philosopher could have surprisingly high Wisdom.
An awakened object needs no air, food, water, or 
sleep. Damage to an awakened object can be healed or mechanically repaired.

• An enemy has disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes against you or an ally.
• Y ou divine the location of an invisible or hidden creature and impart that knowledge to any allies who can see or hear you. This knowledge does not negate any advantages the creature has, it only allows your allies to be aware of its location at the time. If the creature moves after being detected, its new location is not imparted to your allies.
• Three allies who can see and hear you on your turn are given the benefit of a bless, guidance, or resistance spell on their turns; you choose the benefit individually for each ally. An ally must use the benefit on its turn, or the benefit is lost.

2nd-level enchantment
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 30 feetComponents: V , SDuration: 1 minute


Y ou issue a challenge against one creature you can see
within range, which must make a successful Wisdom 
saving throw or become charmed. On a failed save, you can 
make an ability check as a bonus action. For example, you could make a Strength (Athletics) check to climb a difficult surface or to jump as high as possible; you could make a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to perform a backflip; or you could make a Charisma (Performance) check to sing a high note or to extemporize a clever rhyme. Y ou can choose to use your spellcasting ability modifier in place of the usual 
ability modifier for this check, and you add your proficiency bonus if you're proficient in the skill being used.
The charmed creature must use its next action (which 
can be a legendary action) to make the same ability check in a contest against your check. Even if the creature can't perform the action—it may not be close enough to a wall to climb it, or it might not have appendages suitable for strumming a lute—it must still attempt the action to the best of its capability. If you win the contest, the spell (and the contest) continues, with you making a new ability check as a bonus action on your turn. The spell ends when it expires or when the creature wins the contest.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using 
a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for every two slot levels above 2nd. Each creature must be within 30 feet of another creature when you cast the spell.

For the duration, the target’s attacks deal an extra 1d6 damage of the same type dealt by its weapon, and the target can’t be charmed or frightened. If there are no enemies within reach, the target can use its action to repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success.
This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 2nd.


BEWILDERMENT
Enchantment cantrip

BINDING OATH
4th-level necromancy
Casting Time: 10 minutesRange: 30 feetComponents: V , SDuration: Until dispelled


Y ou seal an agreement between two or more willing
creatures with an oath in the name of the god of justice, using ceremonial blessings during which both the oath and the consequences of breaking it are set: if any of the sworn break this vow, they are struck by a curse. For each 
43
SPELL DESCRIPTIONSindividual that does so, you choose one of the options 
given in the bestow curse spell. When the oath is broken, all participants are immediately aware that this has occurred, but they know no other details. 
The curse effect of binding oath can’t be dismissed by 
dispel magic, but it can be removed with dispel evil and good, remove curse, or wish. Remove curse functions only if the spell slot used to cast it is equal to or higher than the spell slot used to cast binding oath. Depending on the nature of the oath, one creature’s breaking it may or may not invalidate the oath for the other targets. If the oath is completely broken, the spell ends for every affected creature, but curse effects already bestowed remain until dispelled.

behind a magic orb in your hand that pulses with dim purple light. Allies that you designate become invisible if they're within 60 feet of you and if light from the orb can reach the space they occupy. An invisible creature still casts a faint, purple shadow.


The orb can be used as a thrown weapon to attack an
enemy. On a hit, the orb explodes in a flash of light and the spell ends. The targeted enemy and each creature within 10 feet of it must make a successful Dexterity saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute. A creature blinded in this way repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.


BLACK SWAN STORM
2nd-level evocation
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 30 feetComponents: V , S, M (a feather from a black swan)Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute


Y ou call forth a whirlwind of black feathers that fills a
5-foot cube within range. The feathers deal 2d8 force damage to creatures in the cube’s area and radiate darkness, causing the illumination level within 20 feet of the cube to drop by one step (from bright light to dim light, and from dim light to darkness). Creatures that make a successful Dexterity saving throw take half the damage and are still affected by the change in light.At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the feathers deal an extra 1d8 force damage for each slot level above 2nd.

ally of the target)

now dead, and it leaps into the air and flies to another ally (chosen by you) within 15 feet of you. The weapon enters that ally’s space and moves when the ally moves. If the weapon or the ally is forced to move more than 5 feet from the other, the spell ends.


The weapon acts on your turn by making an attack if
a target presents itself. Its attack modifier equals your spellcasting level + the weapon’s inherent magical bonus, if any; it receives only its own inherent magical bonus to damage. The weapon fights for up to 4 rounds or until your concentration is broken, after which the spell ends and it falls to the ground.


BLEATING CALL
2nd-level enchantment

Each creature that starts its turn within 30 feet of 
the sound and can hear it must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target must take the Dash or Disengage action and move toward the sound by the safest available route on each of its turns. When it arrives to the source of the sound, the target must use its action to examine the sound. Once it has examined the sound, the target determines the sound is illusory and can no longer hear it, ending the spell’s effects on that target and preventing the target from being affected by the sound again for the duration of the spell. If a target takes damage from you or a creature friendly to you, it is no longer under the effects of this spell. 
Creatures that can’t be charmed are immune to this spell.

BREEZE COMPASS
3rd-level divination
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: SelfComponents: V , S, M (a magnetized needle)Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour
When you cast breeze compass, you must clearly imagine 
or mentally describe a location. It doesn’t need to be a location you’ve been to as long as you know it exists on the Material Plane. Within moments, a gentle breeze arises and blows along the most efficient path toward that destination. Only you can sense this breeze, and whenever it brings you to a decision point (a fork in a passageway, for example), you must make a successful DC 8 Intelligence (Arcana) check to deduce which way the breeze indicates you should go. On a failed check, the spell ends. The breeze

enemy approaches to within 5 feet of you
Range: 10 feetComponents: VDuration: Instantaneous

of you, you utter a perplexing word that alters the foe’s course. The enemy must make a successful Wisdom saving throw or take 2d4 psychic damage and use the remainder of its speed to move in a direction of your choosing.
At Higher Levels.


When you cast this spell using a spell
slot of 2nd level or higher, the target takes an additional 
2d4 psychic damage for each slot level above 1st.


BY THE LIGHT OF THE MOON
2nd-level divination (labyrinth)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: Self (30-foot radius)Components: V , SDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
The area within 30 feet of you becomes bathed in 
magical moonlight. In addition to providing dim light, it highlights objects and locations that are hidden or that hold a useful clue. Until the spell ends, all Wisdom (Perception) and Intelligence (Investigation) checks made in the area are made with advantage.


BY THE LIGHT OF THE WATCHFUL MOON
4th-level divination
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 90 feetComponents: V , SDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Regardless of the time of day or your location, you 
command the watchful gaze of the moon to illuminate threats to you and your allies. Shafts of bright moonlight, each 5 feet wide, shine down from the sky (or from the ceiling if you are indoors), illuminating all spaces within range that contain threats, whether they are enemies, traps, or hidden hazards. An enemy creature that makes a successful Charisma saving throw resists the effect and is not picked out by the moon’s glow.
The glow does not make invisible creatures visible, but 
it does indicate an invisible creature’s general location (somewhere within the 5-foot beam). The light continues to illuminate any target that moves, but a target that moves out of the spell’s area is no longer illuminated. A threat that enters the area after the spell is cast is not subject to the spell’s effect.
CANDLE’S INSIGHT
1st-level divination
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 10 feetComponents: V , S, M (a blessed candle)Duration: 10 minutes
Candle’s insight is cast on its target as the component candle 
is lit. The candle burns for up to 10 minutes unless it’s extinguished normally or by the spell’s effect. While the candle burns, the caster can question the spell’s target, and the candle reveals whether the target speaks truthfully. An intentionally misleading or partial answer causes the flame to flicker and dim. An outright lie causes the flame to flare and then go out, ending the spell. The candle judges honesty, not absolute truth; the flame burns steadily through even an outrageously false statement, as long as the target believes it’s true.
Candle’s insight is used across society: by merchants while 
negotiating deals, by inquisitors investigating heresy, and by monarchs as they interview foreign diplomats. In some societies, casting candle’s insight without the consent of the spell’s target is considered a serious breach of hospitality.


CARMELLO-VOLTA'S IRKSOME PRESERVES
2nd-level conjuration
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 30 feetComponents: V , S, M (a small berry or a piece of fruit)Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
At your command, delicious fruit jam oozes from a small 
mechanical device (such as a crossbow trigger, a lock, or a clockwork toy), rendering the device inoperable until the spell ends and the device is cleaned with a damp cloth. Cleaning away the jam takes an action, but doing so has no effect until the spell ends. One serving of the jam can be collected in a suitable container. If it's eaten (as a bonus action) within 24 hours, the jam restores 1d4 hit points. The jam's flavor is determined by the material component.
The spell can affect constructs, with two limitations. 
First, the target creature negates the effect with a successful Dexterity saving throw. Second, unless the construct is Tiny, only one component (an eye, a knee, an elbow, and so forth) can be disabled. The affected construct has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks that depend on the disabled component until the spell ends and the jam is removed.

fulcrum worth 400 gp)
Duration: Instantaneous
 Y ou magically hurl an object or creature weighing 500 
pounds or less 40 feet through the air in a direction of your choosing (including straight up). Objects hurled at specific targets require a spell attack roll to hit. A thrown creature takes 6d10 bludgeoning damage from the force of the throw, plus any appropriate falling damage, and lands prone. If the target of the spell is thrown against another creature, the total damage is divided evenly between them and both creatures are knocked prone.
At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a 
spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10, the distance thrown increases by 10 feet, and the weight thrown increases by 100 pounds for each slot level above 6th.


CAUSTIC TOUCH
Evocation cantrip
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: T ouchComponents: V , SDuration: Instantaneous


Y our hand sweats profusely and becomes coated in a
film of caustic slime. Make a melee spell attack against a creature you touch. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 acid damage. If the target was concentrating on a spell, it has disadvantage on its Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration.
This spell’s damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th 
level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).


CHAINS OF THE GODDESS
5th-level enchantment (clockwork)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 90 feetComponents: V , S, M (1 foot of iron chain)Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Choose a creature you can see within 90 feet. The 
target must make a successful Wisdom saving throw or be restrained by chains of psychic force and take 6d8 bludgeoning damage. A restrained creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a successful save. While restrained in this way, the creature also takes 6d8 bludgeoning damage at the start of each of your turns.


CHAINS OF TORMENT
4th-level conjuration
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: SelfComponents: 
V , S, M (an iron chain link dipped in blood)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Y ou are surrounded by an aura of dim light in a 10-foot 
radius as you conjure an iron chain that extends out to a creature you can see within 30 feet. The creature must make a successful Dexterity saving throw or be grappled (escape DC equal to your spell save DC). While grappled in this way, the creature is also restrained. A creature that’s restrained at the start of its turn takes 4d6 psychic damage. Y ou can have only one creature restrained in this way at a time.
As an action, you can scan the mind of the creature that’s 
restrained by your chain. If the creature gets a failure on a Wisdom saving throw, you learn one discrete piece of information of your choosing known by the creature (such as a name, a password, or an important number). The effect is otherwise harmless.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using 
a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the psychic damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 4th.
CHAMPION’S WEAPON
2nd-level conjuration
Casting Time: 1 bonus actionRange: SelfComponents: V , SDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes


A spectral version of a melee weapon of your choice
materializes in your hand. It has standard statistics for a weapon of its kind, but it deals force damage instead of its normal damage type and it sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius. Y ou have proficiency with this weapon for the spell’s duration. The weapon can be wielded only by the caster; the spell ends if the weapon is held by a creature other than you or if you start your turn more than 10 feet from the weapon.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 
spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the weapon deals an extra 1d8 force damage for each slot level above 2nd.

4th-level abjuration
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: SelfComponents: V , S, M (a snake scale)Duration: 10 minutes
A mass of writhing, translucent snakes drapes your body, 
protecting you from harm and fending off enemies. Y ou can end the spell early by using an action to dismiss it. 
For the duration of the spell, you gain resistance to 
poison damage and immunity to the poisoned condition. In addition, whenever a creature within 5 feet hits you with a melee attack, that creature is struck by one of the serpents. The attacker takes 2d8 poison damage and must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. A successful saving throw halves the damage and negates the poisoned effect.
CHERUB’S BURNING BLADE
4th-level evocation
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: SelfComponents: V , SDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
A sword made of holy fire blazes to life in your hand. The 
size and shape of the blade conforms to your will, but it is never larger than a one-handed weapon sized for a Medium creature. If you let go of the blade, it disappears, but if you maintain concentration on the spell, you can evoke the blade again as a bonus action.


Y ou can use your action to make a melee attack with the
burning blade. On a hit, the target takes 2d6 fire and 2d6 radiant damage. On a critical hit, the target catches fire; until someone takes an action to douse the fire, the target takes 2d6 fire damage at the start of each of its turns. The burning blade sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 
spell slot of 6th level or higher, both the fire damage and radiant damage increase by 1d6 for every two slot levels above 4th.


CHILLING WORDS
3rd-level enchantment
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 30 feetComponents: V , S, M (a strip of paper with writing on it)Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour


Y ou utter a short phrase and designate a creature within
range to be affected by it. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw to avoid the spell. On a failed save, the target is susceptible to the phrase for the duration of the spell. At any later time while the spell is in effect, you and any of your allies within range when you cast the spell can use an action to utter the phrase, which causes the target to freeze in fear. Each of you can use the phrase against the target once only, and the target must be within 30 feet of the speaker for the phrase to be effective.
When the target hears the phrase, it must make a 
successful Constitution saving throw or take 1d6 psychic damage and become restrained for 1 round. Whether this saving throw succeeds or fails, the target can’t be affected by the phrase for 1 minute afterward.


Y ou can end the spell early by making a final utterance
of the phrase (even if you’ve used the phrase on this target previously). On hearing this final utterance, the target

SPELL DESCRIPTIONSCLOAK OF VERMIN
3rd-level conjuration
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: SelfComponents: V , S, M (a handful of dead flies)Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes


Y ou conjure a writhing garment of living insects that
protect you and harm your foes. While the spell is active, you gain a +1 bonus to AC. Whenever a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with a melee attack, the insects lash out, dealing 2d4 piercing damage to the attacker. 
As a bonus action, you can command your cloak to leave 
your body, becoming a swarm of insects, and enter the space of an adjacent foe. The swarm attacks that foe until you use a bonus action to command it to return to you, the foe moves more than 5 feet away from you, the spell ends, or the swarm dies. Y ou lose the protective benefit of the cloak when using it in this fashion.


CLOCKWORK BODYGUARD
5th-level conjuration (clockwork)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 60 feetComponents: V , SDuration: Concentration, up to 1 hour
Y ou summon clockwork minions to fight for you. Choose 
one of the following options for what appears (refer to T ome of Beasts, p. 62-65, for statistics):
• One clockwork huntsman
• Two clockwork hounds
• Four clockwork watchmen


The clockwork creatures are friendly to you and your
companions for the duration. Roll initiative for the 
creatures, which have their own turns. They obey any verbal commands you issue to them (no action required by you). If you don’t issue commands, the clockwork creatures defend 
themselves or you from hostile creatures but otherwise take no actions. The clockwork creatures disappear when they drop to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using 
certain higher-level spell slots, more creatures of your choice appear: twice as many with a 6th-level slot, three times as many with a 7th-level slot, and four times as many with an 8th-level slot. CLOCKWORK BOLT
Evocation cantrip (clockwork)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 60 feetComponents: V , S, M (an arrow or crossbow bolt)Duration: 1 round


Y ou imbue an arrow or crossbow bolt with clockwork
magic just as you fire it at your target; spinning blades materialize on the missile after it strikes to further mutilate your enemy.
As part of the action used to cast this spell, you make a 
ranged weapon attack with a bow or a crossbow against one creature within range. If the attack hits, the missile embeds in the target. Unless the target (or an ally of it within 5 feet) uses an action to remove the projectile (which deals no additional damage), the target takes an additional 1d8 slashing damage at the end of its next turn from spinning blades that briefly sprout from the missile’s shaft. Afterward, the projectile reverts to normal.


This spell deals more damage when you reach higher
levels. At 5th level, the ranged attack deals an extra 1d8 slashing damage to the target, and the target takes an additional 1d8 slashing damage (2d8 total) if the embedded ammunition isn’t removed. Both damage amounts increase by 1d8 again at 11th level and at 17th level.


CLOSING IN
3rd-level illusion
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 30 feetComponents: V , SDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Choose a creature you can see within range. The target 
must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw, which it makes with disadvantage if it’s in an enclosed space. On a failed save, the creature believes the world around it is closing in and threatening to crush it. Even in open or clear terrain, the creature feels as though it is sinking into a pit, or that the land is rising around it. The creature has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls for the duration, and it takes 2d6 psychic damage at the end of each of its turns. An affected creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell 
slot of 4th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 3rd.

SPELL DESCRIPTIONSCLUMSINESS
Necromancy cantrip
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 30 feetComponents: V , SDuration: 1 minute


Y ou temporarily make a creature within range less
dexterous. If the target makes a successful Constitution saving throw, the spell is ineffective. On a failed save, the next time the creature makes a Dexterity check before the spell ends, roll a d6 and subtract the result from the roll. The spell then ends.


COBRA FANGS
1st-level transmutation
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: T ouchComponents: V , S, M (a drop of snake venom or a patch 
of snakeskin)
Duration: 1 minute
The spell causes the target to grow great, snake-like fangs. 
An unwilling creature must make a Wisdom saving throw to avoid the effect. The spell fails if the target already has a bite attack that deals poison damage. 
If the target doesn’t have a bite attack, it gains one. The 
target is proficient with the bite, and it adds its Strength modifier to the attack and damage rolls. The damage is piercing and the damage die is a d4. 
When the target hits a creature with its bite attack, the 
creature must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 3d6 poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. 
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 
spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the target’s bite counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.


COMMAND UNDEAD
3rd-level necromancy
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 60 feetComponents: VDuration: Concentration


Y ou speak a one-word command to all undead creatures
you can see within range. Any target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or follow the command on its next turn. The spell has no effect if the target is living, if it doesn't understand your language, or if your command is directly harmful to it. COMPELLED MOVEMENT
3rd-level enchantment
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 60 feetComponents: V , S, M (the embalmed body of a millipede 
with its right legs removed, worth at least 50 gp)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Choose two living creatures (not constructs or undead) 
you can see within range. Each must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, a creature is compelled to use its movement to move toward the other creature. Its route must be as direct as possible, but it avoids dangerous terrain and enemies. If the creatures are within 5 feet of each other at the end of either one’s turn, their bodies fuse together. Fused creatures still take their own turns, but they can’t move, can’t use reactions, and have disadvantage on attack rolls, Dexterity saving throws, and Constitution checks to maintain concentration.


A fused creature can use its action to make a Charisma
saving throw. On a success, the creature breaks free and can move as it wants. It can become fused again, however, if it’s within 5 feet of a creature that’s still under the spell’s effect at the end of either creature’s turn.
Compelled movement doesn’t affect a creature that can’t be 
charmed or that is incorporeal.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 
spell slot of 5th level or higher, the number of creatures you can affect increases by one for every two slot levels above 3rd.


COMPELLING FATE
3rd-level divination
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 30 feetComponents: V , M (a sprinkling of silver dust worth  
20 gp)
Duration: 1 round


Y ou view the actions of a single creature you can see
through the influence of the stars, and you read what is written there. If the target fails a Charisma saving throw, you can predict that creature’s actions. This has the following effects:
• Y ou have advantage on attack rolls against the target.
• For every 5 feet the target moves, you can move 5 feet (up to your normal movement) on the target’s turn when it has completed its movement. This is deducted from your next turn’s movement.
• As a reaction at the start of the target’s turn, you can warn yourself and allies that can hear you of the 
52
SPELL DESCRIPTIONStarget’s offensive intentions; any creature targeted by 
the target’s next attack gains a +2 bonus to AC or to its saving throw against that attack.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the duration is extended by 1 round for each slot level above 3rd.


COMPREHEND WILD SHAPE
2nd-level divination
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: T ouchComponents: V , S, M (two or more matching carved 
totems)
Duration: 1 hour


Give one of the carved totems to an ally while keeping
the other yourself. For the duration of the spell, you and whoever holds the other totem can communicate while either of you is in a beast shape. This isn’t a telepathic link; 
you simply understand each other’s verbal communication, 
similar to the effect of a speak with animals spell. This effect doesn’t allow a druid in beast shape to cast spells.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using 
a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can increase the number of target creatures by two for each slot level above 2nd. Each creature must receive a matching carved totem.


CONFOUND SENSES
3rd-level enchantment (labyrinth)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 30 feetComponents: V , S, M (a broken compass)Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes


This spell befuddles the minds of up to six creatures
that you can see within range, causing the creatures to see images of shifting terrain. Each target that fails an Intelligence saving throw is reduced to half speed until the spell ends because of confusion over its surroundings, and it makes ranged attack rolls with disadvantage.


Affected creatures also find it impossible to keep
track of their location. They automatically fail Wisdom (Survival) checks to avoid getting lost. Whenever an affected creature must choose between one or more paths, it chooses at random and immediately forgets which direction it came from.CONJURE FEY HOUND
5th-level conjuration
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 60 feetComponents: V , S, M (a wooden or metal whistle)Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour
Y ou summon a fey hound to fight by your side. A hound of 
the night (T ome of Beasts, p. 251) appears in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. The hound disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.

crimson light. Until the spell ends, you have advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks made against creatures that can see you, and you have advantage on spell attack rolls that deal necrotic damage to creatures that can see your eyes.


DISRUPTIVE AURA
8th-level evocation
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 150 feetComponents: V , SDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
A warping, prismatic aura surrounds and outlines each 
creature inside a 10-foot cube within range. The aura sheds dim light out to 10 feet, and the the locations of hidden or invisible creatures are outlined. If a creature in the area tries to cast a spell or use a magic item, it must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the spell or item functions normally. On a failed save, the effect of the spell or the item is suppressed for the duration of the aura. Time spent suppressed counts against the duration of the spell’s or item’s effect.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 
9th -level spell slot, the cube is 20 feet on a side.

SPELL DESCRIPTIONSDISTRACTING DIVINATION
2nd-level divination
Casting Time: 1 reaction, which you take when an 
enemy tries to cast a spell
Range: T ouchComponents: V , SDuration: Instantaneous


Foresight tells you when and how to be just distracting
enough to foil an enemy spellcaster. When an adjacent enemy tries to cast a spell, make a melee spell attack against that enemy. On a hit, the enemy’s spell fails and has no effect; the enemy’s action is used up but the spell slot isn’t expended.


DISTRACTION CASCADE
2nd-level divination
Casting Time: 1 reaction, which you take when an ally 
declares an attack against an enemy you can see
Range: 30 feetComponents: V , SDuration: Instantaneous
With a flash of foresight, you throw a foe off balance. 
Choose one creature you can see that your ally has just declared as the target of an attack. Unless that creature makes a successful Charisma saving throw, attacks against it are made with advantage until the end of this turn.


DISTRESSING RESONANCE
4th-level evocation
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 30 feetComponents: V , SDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Y ou create a field of subsonic vibrations in a 30-foot-radius 
sphere, centered on a point you choose within range, that 
causes physical distress and extreme discomfort. A creature 
in this area or that enters it after you cast the spell must 
succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be incapacitated 
until the beginning of its next turn. On a successful save, the creature can act normally. If a creature begins its turn in the area, it must make another successful save to avoid being incapacitated. Constructs, deafened creatures, oozes, plants, and undead are not affected by this spell.


The vibrations from the distressing resonance interfere
with tremorsense, negating any use of that ability in the spell’s area.DOME OF SILENCE
2nd-level abjuration
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: SelfComponents: V , SDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
An invisible dome encompasses a 10-foot-radius around 
you, creating a damper for any sound traveling into or out of the area. Creatures can pass through the dome normally, but sound does not. You and any creatures in the dome can hear one another, but nothing outside. Likewise, any noise made in the dome of silence cannot be heard outside it.
Any attack that deals thunder damage dispels the dome, 
but the dome reduces that damage to any creatures inside it by half.


DOOM OF BLUE CRYSTAL
3rd-level transmutation
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: SelfComponents: V , S, M (a blue crystal)Duration: Concentration, up to 3 rounds
Y ou are surrounded by a field of glowing, blue energy 
lasting 3 rounds. Creatures within 5 feet of you, including yourself, must make a Constitution saving throw when the spell is cast and again at the start of each of your turns while the spell is in effect. A creature whose saving throw fails is restrained; a restrained creature whose saving throw fails is paralyzed; and a paralyzed creature whose saving throw fails is petrified and transforms into a statue of blue crystal. As with all concentration spells, you can end the field at any time (no action required). If you are turned to crystal, the spell ends after all affected creatures make their saving throws. Restrained and paralyzed creatures recover immediately when the spell ends, but petrification is permanent.
Creatures turned to crystal can see, hear, and smell 
normally, but they don’t need to eat or breathe. If shatter is 
cast on a crystal creature, it must succeed on a Constitution 
saving throw against the caster’s spell save DC or be killed .


Creatures transformed into blue crystal can be restored
with dispel magic, greater restoration, or comparable magic.

SPELL DESCRIPTIONSDOOM OF CONSUMING FIRE
2nd-level evocation
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: SelfComponents: V , S, M (a dead coal or a fistful of ashes)Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Y ou are  wreathed in cold, purple fire that damages 
creatures near you. Y ou take 1d6 cold damage each round for the duration of the spell. Creatures within 5 feet of you when you cast the spell and at the start of each of your turns while the spell is in effect take 1d8 cold damage.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 3rd-
level spell slot, the purple fire extends 10 feet from you, you take 1d8 cold damage, and other creatures take 1d10 
cold damage. When you cast this spell using a 4th -level 
slot, the fire extends 15 feet from you, you take1d10 cold damage, and other creatures take 1d12 cold damage. When you cast this spell using a slot of 5th level or higher, the fire extends to 20 feet, you take 1d12 cold damage, and other creatures take 1d20 cold damage.


DOOM OF DANCING BLADES
3rd-level illusion
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: SelfComponents: V , SDuration: Concentration, up to 1 hour
When you cast doom of dancing blades, you create 1d4 
illusory copies of your weapon that float in the air 5 feet from you. These images move with you, spinning, shifting, and mimicking your attacks. When you are hit by a melee attack but the attack roll exceeded your Armor Class by 3 or less, one illusory weapon parries the attack; you take no damage and the illusory weapon is destroyed. When you are hit by a melee attack that an illusory weapon can’t parry (the attack roll exceeds your AC by 4 or more), you take only half as much damage from the attack, and an illusory weapon is destroyed. Spells and effects that affect an area or don’t require an attack roll affect you normally and don’t destroy any illusory weapons.


If you make a melee attack that scores a critical hit while
doom of dancing blades is in effect on you, all your illusory weapons also strike the target and deal 1d8 bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage (your choice) each.


The spell ends when its duration expires or when all your
illusory weapons are destroyed or expended.


An attacker must be able to see the illusory weapons to
be affected. The spell has no effect if you are invisible or in total darkness or if the attacker is blinded.DOOM OF DISENCHANTMENT
3rd-level abjuration
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: SelfComponents: V , SDuration: Concentration, up to 5 rounds
When you cast doom of disenchantment, your armor and 
shield glow with light. When a creature hits you with an 
attack, the spell counters any magic that provides the attack 
with a bonus to hit or to damage. For example, a +1 weapon would still be considered magical, but it gets neither +1 to hit nor +1 to damage on any attack against you.


The spell also suppresses other magical properties of
the attack. A sword of wounding, for example, can’t cause 
ongoing wounds on you, and you recover hit points lost to the weapon's damage normally. If the attack was a spell, it’s affected as if you had cast counterspell, using Charisma as your spellcasting ability. Spells with a duration of instantaneous, however, are unaffected.


DOOM OF SERPENT COILS
4th-level necromancy
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: Self (10-foot radius)Components: V , S, M (a vial of poison)Duration: Instantaneous


Y ou drink a dose of venom or other poison and spread
the effect to other living things around you. If the poison normally allows a saving throw, your save automatically fails. Y ou suffer the effect of the poison normally before spreading the poison to all other living creatures within 10 feet of you. Instead of making the usual saving throw against the poison, each creature around you makes a Constitution saving throw against the spell. On a successful save, a target suffers no damage or other effect from the poison and is immune to further castings of doom of serpent coils for 24 hours. On a failed save, a target doesn't suffer the poison’s usual effect; instead, it takes 4d6 poison damage and is poisoned. While poisoned in this way, a creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a subsequent failed save, it takes 4d6 poison damage and is still poisoned. On a subsequent successful save, it is no longer poisoned and is immune to further castings of doom of serpent coils for 24 hours.


Multiple castings of this spell have no additional effect
on creatures that are already poisoned by it. The effect can be ended by protection from poison or comparable magic.

SPELL DESCRIPTIONSDOOM OF THE CRACKED SHIELD
1st-level transmutation
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: T ouchComponents: V , SDuration: Instantaneous
Doom of the cracked shield is cast on a melee weapon. The 
next time that weapon is used, it destroys the target’s nonmagical shield or damages nonmagical armor, in addition to the normal effect of the attack. If the foe is using a nonmagical shield, it breaks into pieces. If the foe doesn’t use a shield, its nonmagical armor takes a -2 penalty to AC. If the target doesn’t use armor or a shield, the spell is expended with no effect.


DOOM OF THE EARTHEN MAW
4th-level evocation
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 60 feetComponents: V , SDuration: 1 minute
The ground within 30 feet of a point you designate turns 
into filthy and slippery muck. This spell affects sand, earth, mud, and ice, but not stone, wood, or other material. For the duration, the ground in the affected area is difficult terrain. A creature in the area when you cast the spell must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be restrained by the mud until the spell ends. A restrained creature can free itself by using an action to make a successful Strength saving throw. A creature that frees itself or that enters the area after the spell was cast is affected by the difficult terrain but doesn’t become restrained.
Each round, a restrained creature sinks deeper into the 
muck. A Medium or smaller creature that is restrained for 3 rounds becomes submerged at the end of its third turn. A Large creature becomes submerged after 4 rounds. Submerged creatures begin suffocating if they aren’t holding their breath. A creature that is still submerged when the spell ends is sealed beneath the newly solidified ground. The creature can escape only if someone else digs it out or it has a burrowing speed.DOOM OF THE PIT
4th-level conjuration
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 120 feetComponents: V , S, M (dust from a stone quarry)Duration: 1 minute


Y ou create a ripple of dark energy that destroys everything
it touches. A 10-foot-radius, 10-foot-deep, cylindrical extradimensional hole appears on a horizontal surface of sufficient size. Since it extends into another dimension, the pit has no weight and does not otherwise displace the original underlying material. Y ou can create the pit in the deck of a ship as easily as in a dungeon floor or the ground of a forest.
The pit’s radius expands by 10 feet at the start of your 
turn each round for the duration. Any creature standing in the original conjured space, or on a space taken up by the pit as it grows, must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw to avoid falling in. Any creature adjacent to the pit when it expands must likewise succeed on a Dexterity saving throw to avoid falling in. Creatures subjected to a successful pushing effect (such as by a spell like gust of wind) may not make this saving throw. Creatures that fall into the pit take falling damage as normal. 
The walls of the pit are slick and slimy, requiring a DC 
15 Strength (Athletics) check to climb. Creatures and objects that remain in the pit take 1d6 necrotic damage at the start of each of their turns. If you fall into your own pit, you take damage; then the spell ends and you are incapacitated for 2 rounds. When the spell ends, the floor of the pit rises, bringing creatures in the pit back up to the original surface. Each creature in the pit must then make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is stunned for 2 rounds after the spell ends.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 
spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can increase the depth of the pit by 10 feet for each slot level above 3rd.


DOOM OF THE SLIPPERY ROGUE
2nd-level conjuration
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 40 feetComponents: V , S, M (bacon fat)Duration: 1 minute
A doom of the slippery rogue spell covers a 20-foot-by-20-foot 
section of wall or floor within range with a thin coating of grease. If a vertical surface is affected, each climber on that surface must make a successful DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check or immediately fall from the surface unless it is held in place by ropes or other climbing gear. A 
64


SPELL DESCRIPTIONScreature standing on an affected floor falls prone unless
it makes a successful Dexterity saving throw. Creatures that try to climb or move through the affected area can move no faster than half speed (this is cumulative with the usual reduction for climbing), and any movement must be followed by a Strength saving throw (for climbing) or a Dexterity saving throw (for walking). On a failed save, the moving creature falls or falls prone.


DRAIN ITEM
4th-level evocation
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: T ouchComponents: V , SDuration: Instantaneous


Y ou touch a magic item and cause its magical energies
to drain away. If the item is currently carried or held by another creature, you must make a melee spell attack to touch the item, against the wielder’s AC. On a hit, the item loses 1d3 charges. If this reduction drops the item’s charges to 0, any effects that occur when the item loses all its charges immediately take effect.
At Higher Levels.


When you cast this spell
using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can 
drain more charges from an item: 1d4 for a 
5th-level slot, 1d6 for a 6th-level slot, 1d8 for a 
7th -level slot, or 2d6 for an 8th- or 9th-level slot.


DREAD WINGS
4th-level necromancy
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 60 feetComponents: V , SDuration: Concentration, up to 
1 minute
A swarm of flying, bat-like shapes 
swirl into existence in a 20-foot-radius cloud around the point you target your spell. Each round a creature begins its turn in the swarm, it takes 4d8 necrotic damage and must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1d4 rounds. Creatures that are immune to necrotic damage are not susceptible to the frightened effect.


Y ou can use an action on your turn to move the
swarm up to 40 feet in any direction.DROWN
3rd-level evocation
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 90 feetComponents: V , S, M (a small piece of flotsam or 
seaweed)
Duration: Instantaneous
Y ou cause a creature's lungs to fill with seawater. Unless 
the target makes a successful Constitution saving throw, it immediately begins suffocating. A suffocating creature can’t speak or perform verbal spell components. It can hold its breath, and thereafter can survive for a number of rounds equal to its Constitution modifier (minimum of 1 round), after which it drops to 0 hit points and is dying. Huge or larger creatures are unaffected, as are creatures that can breathe water or that don’t require air.  

65
SPELL DESCRIPTIONSA suffocating (not dying) creature can repeat the saving 
throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a 
success.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using 
a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 3rd.
DRYAD’S KISS
3rd-level conjuration
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 120 feetComponents: V , M (a flower petal or a drop of blood)Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute


Y ou perform an ancient incantation that summons flora
from the fey realm. A creature you can see within range is covered with small, purple buds and takes 3d8 necrotic damage; a successful Wisdom saving throw negates the damage but doesn’t prevent the plant growth. The buds can be removed by the target or an ally of the target within 5 feet who uses an action to make a successful Intelligence (Nature) or Wisdom (Medicine) check against your spell save DC, or by a greater restoration or blight spell. While the buds remain, whenever the target takes damage from a source other than this spell, one bud blossoms into a purple and yellow flower that deals an extra 1d8 necrotic damage to the target. Once four blossoms have formed in
 
this way, the buds can no longer be removed by nonmagical 
means. The buds and blossoms wilt and fall away when the spell ends, provided the creature is still alive.
If a creature affected by this spell dies, sweet-smelling 
blossoms quickly cover its body. The flowers wilt and die after one month.
At Higher Levels. If this spell is cast using a spell slot 
of 5th level or higher, the number of targets increases by one for every two slot levels above 3rd.


EARS OF THE BAT
3rd-level transmutation
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: SelfComponents: V , S, M (a bit of bat fur)Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour


Y ou gain the keen hearing and echolocation abilities of a
bat. For the duration of the spell, you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing, and you gain blindsight out to a range of 60 feet.
Y ou cannot use the blindsight ability while deafened. 
While the spell is in effect, you have disadvantage on saving throws against spells and effects that deal thunder damage.EARTHSKIMMER
4th-level transmutation
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: SelfComponents: V , S, M (a piece of shale or slate)Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Y ou cause earth and stone to rise up beneath your feet, 
lifting you up to 5 feet. For the duration, you can use your movement to cause the slab to skim along the ground or other solid, horizontal surface at a speed of 60 feet. This movement ignores difficult terrain. If you are pushed or moved against your will by any means other than teleporting, the slab moves with you.
Until the end of your turn, you can enter the space of a 
creature up to one size larger than yourself when you take the Dash action. The creature must make a Strength saving throw. It takes 4d6 bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone on a failed save, or takes half as much damage and isn’t knocked prone on a succesful one.


EARTH WAVE
5th-level transmutation
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: Self (15-foot radius)Components: V , SDuration: Concentration, up to 8 hours


Y ou command the earth beneath your feet to rise and
surge forward, carrying you and your companions where you bid while rolling over enemies and obstacles in your 
path. The earth rises in a 15-foot-high, 15-foot -radius 
swell that can carry you and up to eight other Medium creatures, propelling you in whatever direction you choose at a rate of up to 90 feet per round. Y ou use a bonus action to direct the wave each round. Y our movement is limited to the surface of the wave to maintain control. If you move off the wave, it continues on the same course you directed it, then the spell ends at the beginning of your next turn.
Natural obstacles do not impede the spell’s movement; 
trees, rocks, and other natural obstacles simply rise up and around the swell and settle back into place behind it. The wave can travel up or down natural slopes with angles as great as 60 degrees.


Y ou can direct the wave to surge over man-made
obstacles and creatures in its path. The swell washes over walls and other manufactured obstacles up to 15 feet high and 10 feet thick with no loss of movement, dealing 6d6 bludgeoning damage to an object as it passes. Resolve this damage against larger, rigid objects, such as walls, vehicles, or other similar structures; smaller or malleable objects 
66


SPELL DESCRIPTIONSsuch as unsecured ropes or cloth are simply buried by the
swell’s passing. Larger objects are subject to the damage, but the wave cannot move over them unless the damage is enough to destroy the object.


Creatures of Large size or smaller in the path of the wave
take 6d6 bludgeoning damage and are buried. Buried creatures are considered restrained and must hold their breath or begin to suffocate. A creature in the path of the wave can make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and avoids being buried. Each round, a buried creature can use an action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC to dig itself out.


Y ou can cast earth wave only when standing on natural
earth or stone. The spell can be cast underground, but not inside buildings unless they have no floor.


EARWORM MELODY
1st-level enchantment
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 30 feetComponents: V , SDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute


Y ou sing or play a catchy tune that only one creature
of your choice within range can hear. Unless the creature makes a successful Wisdom saving throw, the verse becomes ingrained in its head. If the target is concentrating on a spell, it must make a Constitution check with disadvantage against your spell save DC in order to maintain concentration.
For the spell’s duration, the target takes 2d4 psychic 
damage at the start of each of its turns as the melody plays over and over in its mind. The target repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. On a failed save, the target must also repeat the Constitution check with disadvantage if it is concentrating on a spell.
At Higher Levels. If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d4 for each slot level above 1st.


ECHOES OF STEEL
4th-level evocation
Casting Time: 1 bonus actionRange: Self (30-foot radius)Components: S
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you 
can use a bonus action to cast echoes of steel. All creatures you designate within 30 feet of you take thunder damage equal to the damage from the melee attack, or half as much damage with a successful Constitution saving throw.


EIDETIC MEMORY
5th-level transmutation (ritual)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: SelfComponents: V , S, M (a string tied in a knot)Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour
When you cast this spell, you can recall any piece of 
information you’ve ever read or heard in the past. This ability translates into a +10 bonus on Intelligence checks for the duration of the spell.


ELEMENTAL HORNS
2nd-level evocation (labyrinth)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: T ouchComponents: V , S, M (a brass wand)Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
The target of this spell must be a creature that has horns, 
or the spell fails. Elemental horns causes the touched creature’s horns to crackle with elemental energy. Select one of the following energy types when casting this spell: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or radiant. The creature’s gore attack deals 3d6 damage of the chosen type in addition to any other damage the attack normally deals.


Although commonly seen among tieflings and
minotaurs, this spell is rarely employed by other races.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 
spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 2d6 for each slot level above 2nd.
ENCRYPT / DECRYPT


Alteration cantrip

By touching a page of written information, you can encode 
its contents. All creatures that try to read the information when its contents are encoded see the markings on the page as nothing but gibberish. The effect ends when either encrypt / decrypt or dispel magic is cast on the encoded writing, which turns it back into its normal state.

SPELL DESCRIPTIONSENDOW ATTRIBUTE
4th-level transmutation
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: T ouchComponents: V , S, M (a ring worth at least 200 gp, 
which the spell consumes)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour


Y ou touch a creature with a ring that has been etched
with symbols representing a particular ability (Strength, Dexterity, and so forth). The creature must make a successful Constitution saving throw or lose one-fifth (rounded down) of its points from that ability score. Those points are absorbed into the ring and stored there for the spell’s duration. If you then use an action to touch the ring to another creature on a later turn, the absorbed ability score points transfer to that creature. Once the points are transferred to another creature, you don’t need to maintain concentration on the spell; the recipient creature retains the transferred ability score points for the remainder of the hour.


The spell ends if you lose concentration before the
transfer takes place, if either the target or the recipient dies, or if either the target or the recipient is affected by a successful dispel magic spell. When the spell ends, the ability score points return to the original owner. Before then, that creature can’t regain the stolen attribute points, even with greater restoration or comparable magic.
At Higher Levels. If you cast this spell using a spell 
slot of 7th or 8th level, the duration is 8 hours. If you use a 
9th -level spell slot, the duration is 24 hours.


ENERGY ABSORPTION

Casting Time: 1 actionRange: T ouchComponents: V , SDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
A creature you touch has resistance to acid, cold, fire, 
force, lightning, and thunder damage until the spell ends.
If the spell is used against an unwilling creature, you 
must make a melee spell attack with a reach of 5 feet. If the attack hits, for the duration of the spell the affected creature must make a saving throw using its spellcasting ability whenever it casts a spell that deals one of the given damage types. On a failed save, the spell is not cast but its slot is expended; on a successful save, the spell is cast but its damage is halved before applying the effects of saving throws, resistance, and other factors.ENERGY FOREKNOWLEDGE

the target of a spell that deals cold, fire, force, lightning, 
necrotic, psychic, radiant, or thunder damage

ENHANCE FAMILIAR
2nd-level transmutation (ritual)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 30 feetComponents: V , S, M (a pinch of powdered iron)Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour
Y ou temporarily imbue your familiar with power, making 
it larger, tougher, and more vicious. While the spell lasts, your familiar has all the statistics of the giant version of its type, except for the fish (quipper), which has the statistics of a reef shark. Y our familiar retains all its special abilities as described in the find familiar spell.
If your familiar drops to 0 hit points and disappears, or 
you dismiss your familiar, the spell ends, and your familiar is returned to its normal form when you next summon it.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using 
a spell slot of 4th level or higher, its duration is 1 hour and does not require concentration. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the duration increases to 24 hours.


ENTOMB
6th-level transmutation
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 90 feetComponents: V , S, M (a chip of granite)Duration: 8 hours


Y ou cause slabs of rock to burst out of the ground or other
stone surface to form a hollow, 10-foot cube within range. A creature inside the cube when it forms must make a successful Dexterity saving throw or be trapped inside the stone tomb. The tomb is airtight, with enough air for a single Medium or Small creature to breathe for 8 hours. If 
68
SPELL DESCRIPTIONSmore than one creature is trapped inside, divide the time 
evenly between all the occupants. A Large creature counts as four Medium creatures. If the creature is still trapped inside when the air runs out, it begins to suffocate.
The tomb has AC 18 and 50 hit points. It is resistant to 
fire, cold, lightning, bludgeoning, and slashing damage, is immune to poison and psychic damage, and is vulnerable to thunder damage. When reduced to 0 hit points, the tomb crumbles into harmless powder.


ENUMERATE
Divination cantrip
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 30 feetComponents: VDuration: Instantaneous


Y ou are able to divine the exact amount of a number of like
objects in a 10-foot-cube centered on a point within range. Y ou can be general (“How many coins in this chest?”) or specific (“How many silver coins in this chest?”) but can receive only one number as a response from the casting of this spell. If, for example, you want to know the number of coins of each denomination in a chest, you must cast the spell anew for each type of coin to be counted (copper, silver, gold, and so forth).


ESSENCE INSTABILITY
5th-level transmutation
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 120 feetComponents: V , SDuration: 1 minute
Y ou cause the target to radiate a harmful aura. Both the 
target and every creature beginning or ending its turn within 20 feet of the target suffer 2d6 poison damage per round. The target can make a Constitution saving throw each round to negate the damage and end the affliction. Success means the target no longer takes damage from the aura, but the aura still persists around the target for the full duration.


Creatures affected by the aura must make a successful
Constitution saving throw each round to negate the damage. The aura moves with the original target and is unaffected by gust of wind and similar spells.
The aura does not detect as magical or poison, and is 
invisible, odorless, and intangible (though the spell’s presence can be detected on the original target). Protection from poison negates the spell’s effects on targets but will not dispel the aura. A foot of metal or stone, two inches of lead, or a force effect such as mage armor or wall of force will block it.At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the aura lasts 1 minute longer and the poison damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 5th.


EXCEPTIONAL WIT
Transmutation cantrip
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: T ouchComponents: V , SDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Y ou touch a willing creature. Once before the spell 
ends, the target can roll a d6 and add the result to one Intelligence check of its choice. It can roll the die before or after making the check. The spell then ends.


EXTRACT KNOWLEDGE
6th-level necromancy (ritual)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: T ouchComponents: V , S, M (a blank page)Duration: Instantaneous
By touching a recently deceased corpse, you gain one 
specific bit of knowledge from it that was known to the creature in life. Y ou must form a question in your mind as part of casting the spell; if the corpse has an answer to your question, it reveals the information to you telepathically. The answer is always brief—no more than a sentence—and very specific to the framed question. It doesn’t matter whether the creature was your friend or enemy; the spell compels it to answer in any case.

grain of truth using a 4th-level spell slot can provide advice equivalent to a divination spell; a 5th-level spell slot can provide advice equivalent to a single answer from a commune spell; and a 6th-level spell slot can provide advice equivalent to three answers from a contact other plane spell.


GRASP OF THE TUPILAK
5th-level necromancy
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: SelfComponents: V , S, M (tupilak idol)Duration: 1 hour or until triggered


This spell functions only against an arcane or divine
spellcaster that prepares spells in advance and that has at least one unexpended spell slot of 6th level or lower. If you make a successful melee attack against such a creature before the spell ends, in addition to the usual effect of that 
77
SPELL DESCRIPTIONSattack, the target takes 2d4 necrotic damage and one or 
more of the victim’s available spell slots are transferred to you, to be used as your own. Roll a d6; the result equals the total levels of the slots transferred. Spell slots of the highest possible level are transferred before lower-level slots. 
For example, if you roll a 5 and the target has at least one 
5th-level spell slot available, that slot transfers to you. If the target’s highest available spell slot is 3rd level, then you might receive a 3rd-level slot and a 2nd-level slot, or a 3rd-level slot and two 1st-level slots if no 2nd-level slot is available.


If the target has no available spell slots of an appropriate
level—for example, if you roll a 2 and the target has expended all of its 1st- and 2nd-level spell slots—then grasp of the tupilak has no effect, including causing no necrotic damage. If a stolen spell slot is of a higher level than you’re able to use, treat it as of the highest level you can use.
Unused stolen spell slots disappear, returning whence 
they came, when you take a long rest or when the creature you stole them from receives the benefit of remove curse, greater restoration, or comparable magic.

as long as the group contains an equal number of allies 
and enemies. If the number of allies and enemies targeted isn’t the same, the spell fails. For the duration of the spell, each target gains a +2 bonus on saving throws, attack rolls, ability checks, skill checks, and weapon damage rolls made involving other targets of the spell. All affected creatures can identify fellow targets of the spell by sight. If an affected creature makes any of the above rolls against a 
non-target, it takes a  –2 penalty on that roll.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the duration increases by 1 
round for each slot level abov e 2nd.


HAMSTRING
Evocation cantrip
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 60 feetComponents: SDuration: Instantaneous


You create an arrow of eldritch energy and send it at a target
you can see within range. Make a ranged spell attack against 
the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d4 force damage, and it can’t take reactions until the end of its next turn.
The spell’s damage increases by 1d4 when you reach 5th 
level (2d4), 11th level (3d4), and 17th level (4d4).

SPELL DESCRIPTIONSHARD HEART
1st-level enchantment
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: T ouchComponents: V , S, M (an iron key)Duration: 10 minutes


Y ou imbue your touch with the power to make a creature
aloof, hardhearted, and unfeeling. The creature you touch as part of casting this spell must make a Wisdom saving throw; a creature can choose to fail this saving throw unless it’s currently charmed. On a successful save, this spell fails. On a failed save, the target becomes immune to being charmed for the duration; if it’s currently charmed, that effect ends. In addition, Charisma checks against the target are made with disadvantage for the spell’s duration.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 
spell slot of 3rd or 4th level, the duration increases to 1 hour. If you use a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the duration is 8 hours.


HARRY
4th-level enchantment
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 120 feetComponents: V , S, M (a bit of fur from a game animal)Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour


Y ou instill an irresistible sense of insecurity and terror in
the target. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target has disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks to avoid your notice and is frightened of you while you are within its line of sight. While you are within 1 mile of the target, you have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to track the target, and the target can’t take a long rest, terrified that you are just around the corner. The target can repeat the saving throw once every 10 minutes, ending the spell on a success. 
On a successful save, the target isn’t affected, and you 
can’t use this spell against it again for 24 hours.
At Higher Levels.


When you cast this spell using a
6th-level spell slot, the duration is concentration, up to 
8 hours, and the target can repeat the saving throw once each hour. When you use a spell slot of 8th level or higher, the duration is concentration, up to 24 hours, 
and the 
target can repeat the saving throw every 8 hours.HARRYING HOUNDS
5th-level enchantment
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 180 feetComponents: V , S, M (a tuft of fur from a hunting dog)Duration: 8 hours
When you cast this spell, choose a direction (north, south, 
northeast, or the like). Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw when you cast this spell or be affected by it.
When an affected creature travels, it travels at a fast 
pace in the opposite direction of the one you chose, as it believes a pack of dogs or wolves follows it from the chosen direction. When an affected creature isn’t traveling, it is frightened of your chosen direction. The affected creature occasionally hears howls or sees glowing eyes in the darkness at the edge of its vision in that direction. An affected creature will not stop at a destination, instead pacing half-circles around the destination until the effect ends, terrified that the pack will overcome it if it stops moving. An affected creature can make a Wisdom saving throw at the end of each 4-hour period, ending the effect on itself on a success.


An affected creature moves along the safest available
route unless it has nowhere to move, such as if it arrives at the edge of a cliff. When an affected creature can’t safely move in the opposite direction from your chosen direction, it cowers in place, defending itself from hostile creatures, but otherwise takes no actions. In such circumstances, the affected creature can repeat the saving throw every minute, ending the effect on itself on a success. The spell’s effect is suspended when an affected creature is engaged in combat, enabling it to move as necessary to face hostile creatures.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 
spell slot of 6th level or higher, the duration increases by 4 hours for each slot level above 5th. If an affected creature travels for more than 8 hours, it risks exhaustion as if on a forced march.
HARSH LIGHT OF SUMMER’S GLARE
8th-level enchantment
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 90 feetComponents: V , SDuration: 1 round
Y ou emit a burst of brilliant light, which bears down 
oppressively upon all creatures within range that can see you. Creatures with darkvision that fail a Constitution 
79
SPELL DESCRIPTIONSsaving throw are blinded and stunned. Creatures without 
darkvision that fail a Constitution saving throw are blinded. This is not a gaze attack, and it cannot be avoided by averting one’s eyes or wearing a blindfold
.


HEART-SEEKING ARROW
4th-level transmutation
Casting Time: 1 bonus actionRange: SelfComponents: VDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute


The next time you make a ranged weapon attack during
the spell’s duration, the weapon’s ammunition—or the weapon itself, if it’s a thrown weapon—seeks its target’s vital organs. Make the attack roll as normal. On a hit, the weapon deals an extra 6d6 damage of the same type dealt by the weapon, or half as much damage on a miss, as it streaks unerringly toward its target. If this attack reduces the target to 0 hit points, the target has disadvantage on its next death saving throw, and, if it dies, it can be restored to life only by means of a true resurrection or a wish spell. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 
spell slot of 5th level or higher, the extra damage on a hit increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 4th.


HEART TO HEART
1st-level necromancy
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: T ouchComponents: V , S, M (a drop of your blood)Duration: 1 hour
For the duration, you and the creature you touch remain 
stable and unconscious if one of you is reduced to 0 hit points while the other has 1 or more hit points. If you touch a dying creature, it becomes stable but remains unconscious while it has 0 hit points. If both of you are reduced to 0 hit points, you must both make death saving throws, as normal. If you or the target regain hit points, either of you can choose to split those hit points between the two of you if both of you are within 60 feet of each other.


HEARTACHE
2nd-level enchantment
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 30 feetComponents: V , S, M (a silver locket)Duration: Instantaneous


Y ou force an enemy to experience pangs of unrequited love
and emotional distress. These feelings manifest with such intensity that the creature takes 5d6 psychic damage on a failed Charisma saving throw, or half the damage on a successful save.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 
spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target an additional enemy for each slot level above 2nd.


HEARTSTOP
2nd-level necromancy (clockwork)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: T ouchComponents: V , SDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
Y ou slow the beating of a willing target’s heart to the rate 
of one beat per minute. The creature’s breathing almost stops. T o a casual or brief observer, the subject appears dead. At the end of the spell, the creature returns to normal with no ill effects.


HEARTSTRIKE
2nd-level divination
Casting Time: 1 bonus actionRange: Self
Components: V , S, M (an arrow, bolt, or other missile)
Duration: Instantaneous


The spirits of ancient archers carry your missiles straight
to their targets. Y ou have advantage on ranged weapon attacks until the start of your next turn, and you can ignore penalties for your enemies having half cover or three-quarters cover, and for an area being lightly obscured, when making those attacks.


HEAVENLY CROWN
6th-level enchantment
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: Self (30-foot radius)Components: 
V , S, M (a small golden crown worth 50 gp)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
A glowing, golden crown appears on your head and sheds 
dim light in a 30-foot radius. When you cast the spell (and as a bonus action on subsequent turns, until the spell ends), you can target one willing creature within 30 feet of you that you can see. If the target can hear you, it can use its reaction to make one melee weapon attack and then move up to half its speed, or vice versa.
80
SPELL DESCRIPTIONSHEDREN’S BIRDS OF CLAY
3rd-level conjuration
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: SelfComponents: V , M (a clay figurine shaped like a bird)Duration: Concentration, up to 5 minutes
Y ou create a number of clay pigeons equal to 1d4 + your 
spellcasting modifier (minimum of one) that swirl around you. When you are the target of a ranged weapon attack or a ranged spell attack and before the attack roll is made, you can use your reaction to shout “Pull!” When you do, one clay pigeon maneuvers to block the incoming attack. If the attack roll is less than 10 + your proficiency bonus, the attack misses. Otherwise, make a check with your spellcasting ability modifier and compare it to the attack roll. If your roll is higher, the attack is intercepted and has no effect. Regardless of whether the attack is intercepted, one clay pigeon is expended. The spell ends when the last clay pigeon is used.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 
spell slot of 4th level or higher, add 1 to your to your roll for each slot level above 3rd when determining if an attack misses or when making a check to intercept the attack.


HEMATOMANCY
3rd-level divination
Casting Time: 1 minuteRange: T ouchComponents: V , S, M (a drop of a creature’s blood)Duration: Instantaneous


Y ou can learn information about a creature whose blood
you possess. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the target knows you’re casting the spell, it can fail the saving throw voluntarily if it wants you to learn the information. On a successful save, the target isn’t affected, and you can’t use this spell against it again for 24 hours. On a failed save, or if the blood belongs to a dead creature, you learn the following information:
• The target’s most common name (if any).
• The target’s creature type (and subtype, if any), gender, and which of its ability scores is highest (though not the exact numerical score).
• The target’s current status (alive, dead, sick, wounded, healthy, etc.).
• The circumstances of the target shedding the blood you’re holding (bleeding wound, splatter from an attack, how long ago it was shed, etc.).
Alternatively, you can forgo all of the above information and instead use the blood as a beacon to track the target. For 1 hour, as long as you are on the same plane of existence as the creature, you know the direction and distance to the target’s location at the time you cast this spell. While moving toward the location, if you are presented with a choice of paths, the spell automatically indicates which path provides the shortest and most direct route to the location.
HERO’S STEEL
3rd-level transmutation
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: T ouchComponents: V , S, M (a warrior's amulet worth 5 gp)Duration: 1 minute


Y ou infuse the metal of a melee weapon you touch with
the fearsome aura of a mighty hero. The weapon’s wielder has advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks made while aggressively brandishing the weapon. In addition, an opponent that currently has 30 or fewer hit points and is struck by the weapon must make a successful Charisma saving throw or be stunned for 1 round. If the creature has more than 30 hit points but fewer than the weapon’s wielder currently has, it becomes frightened instead; a frightened creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a successful save. A creature that succeeds on the saving throw is immune to castings of this spell on the same weapon for 24 hours.


HOBBLE
Evocation cantrip
Casting Time: 1 bonus actionRange: 30 feetComponents: V , S, M (a broken rabbit’s foot)Duration: Instantaneous


Y ou create an ethereal trap in the space of a creature
you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or its speed is halved until the end of its next turn.


HOBBLE MOUNT
1st-level necromancy
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: T ouchComponents: V , SDuration: Concentration, up to 1 hour


When you cast hobble mount as a successful melee spell
attack against a horse, wolf, or other four-legged or two-legged beast being ridden as a mount, that beast is disabled so that it can’t move at its normal speed without incurring 
81
SPELL DESCRIPTIONSinjury. An affected creature that moves more than half its 
base speed in a turn takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage.


HOLY GROUND
5th-level evocation
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: SelfComponents: V , S, M (a vial of holy water that is 
consumed in the casting)
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
Y ou invoke divine powers to bless the ground within 60 
feet of you. Creatures slain in the affected area cannot be raised as undead by magic or by the abilities of monsters, even if the corpse is later removed from the area. Any spell of 4th level or lower that would summon or animate undead within the area fails automatically. Such spells cast with spell slots of 5th level or higher function normally.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 
spell slot of 6th level or higher, the level of spells that are prevented from functioning increases by 1 for each slot level above 5th.


HOLY VOW
3rd-level abjuration (ritual)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: SelfComponents: V , S, M (a vial of holy water)Duration: 24 hours


Y ou willingly take a vow to complete a task or carry out
a service. This task or service cannot conflict with your alignment or your sacred oath. While you serve under the vow, for as long as the spell lasts, your hit point maximum and current hit points increase by 10. Whenever you make an attack roll or a saving throw, roll a d4 and add the result to the attack roll or saving throw. These benefits apply only when you are involved in activities that directly relate to your avowed task, or to situations you encounter that interfere with your ability to carry out that task (such as random encounters while traveling).
If you willingly forsake your vow, the spell ends, and 
you take 4d10 psychic damage. At the GM’s discretion, you might suffer other penalties and need to atone for your decision. See the “Breaking Y our Oath” sidebar in the paladin class description for more details. Failing to complete the task does not incur any penalties as long as you remain true to your vow, nor are you penalized if some form of outside coercion, magical or otherwise, leads you to forsake your vow (being charmed, for instance, or if a villain threatens the lives of innocents if you do not break the vow).HOLY WARDING
2nd-level abjuration
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 30 feetComponents: V , SDuration: 1 round
Y ou make a protective gesture toward your allies. Choose 
three creatures that you can see within range. Until the end of your next turn, the allies you have chosen have resistance to normal weapon attacks, including bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. If a target moves farther than 30 feet from you, the effect ends for that creature.


HONE BLADE
1st-level transmutation
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: T ouchComponents: V , S, M (a chip of whetstone or lodestone)Duration: Instantaneous


Y ou magically sharpen the edge of any bladed weapon or
object you are touching. The target weapon gets a +1 bonus to damage on its next successful hit.
HUNTER’S CUNNING
2nd-level divination
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: T ouchComponents: V , SDuration: 1 hour


Y ou grant a creature you touch preternatural senses and
insight into its immediate environment. Until the spell ends, the target gains advantage on Wisdom (Perception)and Wisdom (Survival) checks and ignores the effect of natural (nonmagical) difficult terrain.
HUNTER’S ENDURANCE
1st-level enchantment
Casting Time: 1 minuteRange: SelfComponents: V , S, M (a fingernail, lock of hair, bit of fur, 
or drop of blood from the target, if unfamiliar)
Duration: 24 hours


Y ou call on the land to sustain you as you hunt your
quarry. Describe or name a creature that is familiar to you. If you aren’t familiar with the target creature, you must use a fingernail, lock of hair, bit of fur, or drop of blood from it as a material component to target that creature with this spell. 
82
SPELL DESCRIPTIONSUntil the spell ends, you have advantage on all Wisdom 
(Perception) and Wisdom (Survival) checks to find and 
track the target, and you must actively pursue the target as if under a geas. In addition, you don’t suffer from exhaustion levels you gain from pursuing your quarry, such as from lack of rest or environmental hazards between you and the target, while the spell is active. When the spell ends, you suffer from all levels of exhaustion that were suspended by the spell. The spell ends only after 24 hours, when the target is dead, when the target is on a different plane, or when the target is restrained in your line of sight.


HUNTING STAND
4th-level conjuration
Casting Time: 1 minuteRange: 120 feetComponents: V , S, M (a crude model of the stand)Duration: 8 hours


Y ou make a camouflaged shelter nestled in the branches
of a tree or among a collection of stones. The shelter is a 10-foot cube centered on a point within range. It can hold as many as nine Medium or smaller creatures. The atmosphere inside the shelter is comfortable and dry, regardless of the weather outside. The shelter’s camouflage provides a modicum of concealment to its inhabitants; a creature outside the shelter has disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) and Intelligence (Investigation) checks to detect or locate a creature within the shelter.


HYPNOTIC MISSIVE
2nd-level enchantment (ritual)
Casting Time: 1 minuteRange: T ouchComponents: V , S, M (ink made with powdered amber, 
worth at least 50 gp)
Duration: 14 days
Y ou write on parchment, paper, or some other 
suitable writing material and imbue it with a powerful enchantment that lasts for the duration. What is actually written is unimportant; the enchantment laid upon the words works on the mind of a creature that reads it, convincing the creature that there is some importance to the message that must be discovered. A creature that reads the message must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be compelled to continue reading and rereading the writing, attempting to glean its meaning and importance. During combat, a creature so enthralled can take no actions or reactions on its turn, but can move if it chooses or needs to do so (to remove itself from danger, for example). A creature under the influence of the hypnotic missive can make a new saving throw against the effects at the beginning of its turn if in a combat situation. In nonthreatening conditions, the creature can make a new saving throw against the effects every hour. 
Once a creature has made a successful save, it recognizes 
the magical compulsion that has affected it. This does not provide immunity from the spell, however, and if the creature reads the words again, it must make another save or fall under the spell’s effects once more.


ICE SOLDIERS
7th-level conjuration
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 30 feetComponents: V , M (vial of water)Duration: 1 minute


Y ou pour water from the vial and cause two ice soldiers
to appear within range. The ice soldiers cannot form if there is no space available for them. The ice soldiers act immediately on your turn. Y ou can mentally command them (no action required by you) to move and act where and how you desire. If you command an ice soldier to attack, it attacks that creature exclusively until the target is dead, at which time the soldier melts into a puddle of water. If an ice soldier moves farther than 30 feet from you, it immediately melts. Ice soldiers have the statistics shown below.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 
spell slot of 8th level or higher, you create one additional ice soldier.

ICY MANIPULATION
6th-level transmutation
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 60 feetComponents: V , S, M (a piece of ice preserved from the 
plane of elemental ice)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute


One creature you can see within range must make a
Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is petrified (frozen solid). A petrified creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself if it makes two successful saves. If a petrified creature gets two failures on the saving throw (not counting the original failure that caused the petrification), the petrification becomes permenant.


The petrification also becomes permanent if you
maintain concentration on this spell for a full minute. A permanently petrified/frozen creature can be restored to normal with greater restoration or comparable magic, or by casting this spell on the creature again and maintaining concentration for a full minute.


If the frozen creature is damaged or broken before it
recovers from being petrified, the injury carries over to its normal state.


ILLUMINATE SPOOR
1st-level divination
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: T ouchComponents: V , S, M (a firefly)Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour
Y ou touch a set of tracks created by a single creature. 
That set of tracks and all other tracks made by the same creature give off a faint glow. Y ou and up to three creatures you designate when you cast this spell can see the glow. A creature that can see the glow automatically succeeds on Wisdom (Survival) checks to track that creature. If the tracks are covered by obscuring objects such as leaves or mud, you and the creatures you designate have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to follow the tracks.
If the creature leaving the tracks changes its tracks, such 

84
SPELL DESCRIPTIONSas by adding or removing footwear, the glow stops where 
the tracks change. Until the spell ends, you can use an action to touch and illuminate a new set of tracks.
At Higher Levels . When you cast this spell using a spell 
slot of 3rd level or higher, the duration is concentration, up 
to 8 hours. When you use a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the duration is concentration, up to 24 hours.


ILLUSORY TRAP
3rd-level illusion
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: T ouchComponents: V , S, M (a needle and a mirror)Duration: 24 hours
Y ou create the illusion of a trap upon an object you touch, 
such as a door, a chest, or a 5-foot-square area of floor. A creature specifically looking for traps that examines the object must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the creature takes 1d10 psychic damage, the spell ends, and the creature realizes that the trap was not real.
 
On a failed save, the creature believes the object contains 
a trap. If the creature then tries to disarm or otherwise interact with the trap in order to set it off, it must make a Dexterity check against your spell save DC. On a successful check, the creature takes 1d10 psychic damage and realizes the trap is not real. On a failed check, the creature takes 5d10 psychic damage and is stunned for 1 round, believing that it accidentally set off the trap and was injured by it.


IMPENDING ALLY
3rd-level conjuration
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 40 feetComponents: V , S, M (a broken chain link)Duration: Concentration, up to 2 rounds


Y ou summon a duplicate of yourself as an ally who appears
in an unoccupied space you can see within range. Y ou control this ally, whose turn comes immediately after yours. When you or the ally uses a class feature, spell slot, or other expendable resource, it’s considered expended for both of you. When the spell ends, or if you are killed, the ally disappears immediately. 
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 
spell slot of 5th level or higher, the duration is extended by 1 round for every two slot levels above 3rd.IMPOTENCE


Necromancy cantrip
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 30 feetComponents: V , SDuration: 1 minute
Y ou temporarily weaken a creature within range. If the 
target makes a successful Constitution saving throw, the spell is ineffective. On a failed save, the next time the creature makes a Strength check before the spell ends, roll a d6 and subtract the result from the roll. The spell then ends.


INDECISION
2nd-level enchantment
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 30 feetComponents: V , SDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Choose a creature you can see within range. The target 
must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be overcome with indecision. On a failed save, the target takes its entire turn to perform its next action due to the creature’s hesitation. If the creature fails the saving throw by 5 or more, it takes no action that round. If the creature has moved before taking an action, its action does not occur until the start of its next turn. Each round, the creature can attempt another saving throw at the start of its turn. On a successful save, the spell ends.


This spell has no effect on a creature with an Intelligence
score of 5 or lower.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using 
a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 2nd. The creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.


INSIGHTFUL MANEUVER
1st-level divination
Casting Time: 1 bonus actionRange: T ouchComponents: V , SDuration: Instantaneous
With a flash of insight, you know how to take advantage 
of your foe’s vulnerabilities. Until the end of your turn, the target has vulnerability to one type of damage (your choice). Additionally, if the target has any other vulnerabilities, you learn them.

SPELL DESCRIPTIONSINSPIRING SPEECH
4th-level enchantment
Casting Time: 10 minutesRange: 60 feetComponents: VDuration: 1 hour
The verbal component of this spell is a 10-minute-long, 
rousing speech. At the end of the speech, all your allies within the affected area who heard the speech gain a +1 bonus on attack rolls and advantage on saving throws for 1 hour against effects that cause the charmed or frightened condition. Additionally, each recipient gains temporary hit points equal to your spellcasting ability modifier. If you move farther than 1 mile from your allies or you die, this spell ends. A character can be affected by only one casting of this spell at a time; subsequent, overlapping castings have no additional effect and don’t extend the spell’s duration.


INSTANT FORTIFICATION
5th-level transmutation (ritual) 
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 60 feetComponents: V , S, M (a statuette of a keep worth 250 gp, 
which is consumed in the casting)
Duration: Permanent
Through this spell, you transform a miniature statuette of 
a keep into an actual fort. The fortification springs from the ground in an unoccupied space within range. It is a 10-foot cube (including floor and roof).
Each wall has two arrow slits. One wall also includes a 
metal door with an arcane lock effect on it. Y ou designate at the time of the fort’s creation which creatures can ignore the lock and enter the fortification. The door has AC 20 and 60 hit points, and it can be broken open with a successful DC 25 Strength (Athletics) check. The walls are made of stone (AC 15) and are immune to necrotic, poison, and psychic damage. Each 5-foot-square section of wall has 90 hit points. Reducing a section of wall to 0 hit points destroys it, allowing access to the inside of the fortification.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using 
a spell slot of 6th level or higher, you can increase the length or width of the fortification by 5 feet for each slot level above 5th. Y ou can make a different choice (width or length) for each slot level above 5th.


INSTANT SIEGE WEAPON
4th-level transmutation (ritual)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 60 feetComponents: V , S, M (raw materials with a value in gp 
equal to the hit points of the siege weapon to be created)
Duration: Permanent
With this spell, you instantly transform raw materials 
into a siege engine of Large size or smaller (the GM has information on this topic). The raw materials for the spell don’t need to be the actual components a siege weapon is normally built from; they just need to be manufactured goods made of the appropriate substances (typically including some form of finished wood and a few bits of worked metal) and have a gold piece value of no less than the weapon’s hit points. 
For example, a mangonel has 100 hit points. Instant siege 
weapon will fashion any collection of raw materials worth at least 100 gp into a mangonel. Those materials might be lumber and fittings salvaged from a small house, or 100 gp worth of finished goods such as three wagons or two heavy crossbows. The spell also creates enough ammunition for ten shots, if the siege engine uses ammunition.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 
spell slot of 6th level, a Huge siege engine can be made; at 8th level, a Gargantuan siege engine can be made. In addition, for each slot level above 4th, the spell creates another ten shots’ worth of ammunition.


INSTANT SNARE
2nd-level abjuration
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 120 feetComponents: V , S, M (a loop of twine)Duration: 24 hours
Y ou create a snare on a point you can see within range. 
Y ou can leave the snare as a magical trap, or you can use your reaction to trigger the trap when a Large or smaller creature you can see moves within 10 feet of the snare. If you leave the snare as a trap, a creature must succeed on an 

86
SPELL DESCRIPTIONSIntelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom (Perception) check 
against your spell save DC to find the trap.
When a Large or smaller creature moves within 5 feet of 
the snare, the trap triggers. The creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be magically pulled into the air. The creature is restrained and hangs upside down 5 feet above the snare’s location for 1 minute. A restrained creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, escaping the snare on a success. Alternatively, a creature, including the restrained target, can use its action to make an Intelligence (Arcana) check against your spell save DC. On a success, the restrained creature is freed, and the snare resets itself 1 minute later. If the creature succeeds on the check by 5 or more, the snare is destroyed instead.

trap is triggered if you are within 1 mile of the snare. This ping awakens you if you are sleeping.

slot of 3rd level or higher, you can create one additional snare for each slot level above 2nd. When you receive the mental ping that a trap was triggered, you know which snare was triggered if you have more than one.

The legion of squirrels is friendly to you and your companions. Roll initiative for the legion, which has its own turns. The legion of squirrels obeys your verbal commands (no action required by you). If you don’t issue any commands to the legion, it defends itself from hostile creatures but otherwise takes no actions.

plausible: you gain advantage on Charisma (Deception) checks to convince another creature of the truth of whatever you’re saying.

For the duration, you can sense the location of any 
creature that isn’t a construct or an undead within 30 feet of you, regardless of impediments to your other senses. This spell doesn’t sense creatures that are dead.

This spell allows a creature within range to quickly
perform a simple task (other than attacking or casting a spell) as a bonus action on its turn. Examples include finding an item in a backpack, drinking a potion, and pulling a rope.

Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 60 feetComponents: 
V , S, M (a pinch of rust and metal shavings)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute


Y ou target a piece of metal equipment or a metal
construct. If the target is a creature wearing metal armor or is a construct, it makes a Wisdom saving throw to negate the effect. On a failed save, the spell causes metal to cling to metal, making it impossible to move pieces against each other. This effectively paralyzes a creature that is made of metal or that is wearing metal armor with moving pieces; for example, scale mail would lock up because the scales must slide across each other, but a breastplate would be unaffected. Limited movement might still be possible, depending on how extensive the armor is, and speech is usually not affected. Metal constructs are paralyzed. An affected creature or construct can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. A grease spell dispels lock armor on everything in 
its area.
At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using 
a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 2nd.

notice that the trail is leading it in a closed loop.

SPELL DESCRIPTIONSLOVESICK
4th-level enchantment
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 90 feetComponents: V , S, M (a handful of red rose petals)Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
This spell causes creatures to behave unpredictably, as 
they randomly experience the full gamut of emotions 
of someone who has fallen head ov er heels in love. Each 
creature in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw when you cast this spell or be affected by it.
An affected target can’t take reactions and must roll 
a d10 at the start of each of its turns to determine its behavior for that turn.
d10 Behavior
1-3 The creature spends its turn moping like a lovelorn teenager; it doesn’t move or take actions.
4–5 The creature bursts into tears, takes the Dash action, and uses all its movement to run off in a random direction. T o determine the direction, roll a d8 and assign a direction to each die face.
6 The creature uses its action to remove one item of clothing or piece of armor. Each round spent removing pieces of armor reduces its AC by 1.
7–8 The creature drops anything it is holding in its hands and passionately embraces a randomly determined creature. T reat this as a grapple attempt which uses the Attack action. 
9 The creature flies into a jealous rage and uses its action to make a melee attack against a randomly determined creature.
10 The creature can act and move normally.
At the end of each of its turns, an affected target can make a Wisdom saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a successful save.

sheer material)

allowing a brief glimpse into the deep nothing beyond this realm to shatter their minds. Each creature you choose within 60 feet of you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take 8d10 psychic damage and be driven insane for 10 minutes, per the symbol spell. On a successful saving throw, a creature takes half the damage and is stunned for 1 round. Creatures already suffering from insanity are immune to this spell. Blindness, however, is not a defense, since the experience is not sight-based, but an internal awareness.


MAGNETIZE
5th-level evocation
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: T ouchComponents: V , S, M (a lodestone)Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
Y ou magnetize a large piece of metal or stone (such as a 
door, a stone pillar, or a 5-foot-square section of floor) that you touch, giving it a powerful attraction to ferrous metal. Any iron objects within 50 feet of the target that are not fastened down or being held or worn are pulled toward it, moving against or up to the target and remaining there. Any creature located between such an object and the magnet might be struck; roll a ranged spell attack against the target’s AC. On a hit, the target takes 2d10 damage of the appropriate type (bludgeoning for a hammer, slashing or piercing for a sword, and so forth).


Objects held by or in the possession of a creature are
also attracted. The creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw to retain a grip on any held or worn objects. On a successful save, the creature retains possession of the object, but is dragged 5 feet closer to the magnet. A creature can voluntarily release a metal object in its possession and forgo a save.
Creatures garbed in mostly metal armor, or made 
of metal, are also attracted to the magnet, and have disadvantage on their saving throws to avoid being pulled toward it. If such a creature succeeds on its saving throw, it can move away from the magnet on its turn, but the area within 50 feet of the magnet is considered difficult terrain. If the creature is still in this area at the start of its next turn, it must make another successful saving throw

it has disadvantage on Dexterity ability checks.

Y ou summon a cylindrical sinkhole filled with burning
ash and grasping arms made of molten metal at a point on the ground you can see within range. The sinkhole is 20 feet deep and 50 feet in diameter, and is difficult terrain. A creature that’s in the area when the spell is cast, or that begins its turn in the area or enters it during its turn, takes 10d6 fire damage and must make a Strength or Dexterity (creature’s choice) saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is restrained by the molten arms, which try to drag it below the surface of the ash.
A creature that’s restrained by the arms at the start of 
your turn must make a successful Strength saving throw or be pulled 5 feet farther down into the ash. A creature pulled below the surface is blinded, deafened, and can’t breathe. T o escape, a creature must use an action to make a successful Strength or Dexterity check against your spell save DC. On a successful check, the creature is no longer restrained and can move through the difficult terrain of the ash pit. It doesn’t need to make a Strength or Dexterity saving throw this turn to not be grabbed by the arms again, but it must make the saving throw as normal if it’s still in the ash pit at the start of its next turn.
The diameter of the ash pit increases by 10 feet at the 
start of each of your turns for the duration of the spell. The ash pit remains after the spell ends, but the grasping arms disappear and restrained creatures are freed automatically. As the ash slowly cools, it deals 1d6 less fire damage for each hour that passes after the spell ends.

103
SPELL DESCRIPTIONSof garbage or carrion ceases to smell, for example, or 
someone sprayed by a skunk no longer bears the odor. If there is still material producing odors in the area, however, the smell will return within an hour. If cast upon the area of a stinking cloud spell, it removes the odor and the spell’s nauseating qualities, but not the obscuring fog itself.


This spell can also be cast on a single creature of up to
Large size, except for one that already gives off a strong odor (such as a troglodyte). For the next hour, the creature has no scent, and it cannot be detected by Wisdom (Perception) checks relying on scent.

spell consumes)
Duration: Instantaneous

That beast returns to life with 1 hit point. This spell can’t return to life a beast that has died of old age, nor can it restore any missing body parts.


RIPTIDE
3rd-level conjuration
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 60 feetComponents: V , SDuration: 1 round
With a sweeping gesture, you cause water to swell up into a 
20-foot tall, 20-foot radius cylinder centered on a point on the ground that you can see. Each creature in the cylinder must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is restrained and suspended in the cylinder; on a successful save, the creature moves to just outside the 
nearest edge of the cylinder.
At the start of your next turn, you can direct the current 
of the swell as it dissipates. Choose one of the following options.
• Riptide. The water in the cylinder flows in a direction you choose, sweeping along each creature in the cylinder. An affected creature takes 3d8 bludgeoning damage and is pushed 40 feet in the chosen direction, landing prone.
• Undertow. The water rushes downward, pulling each creature in the cylinder into an unoccupied space at the center. Each creature is knocked prone and must make a successful Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the start of your next turn.


ROLLING THUNDER
2nd-level evocation
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: Self (30-foot line)Components: V , S, M (a sliver of metal from a gong)Duration: Instantaneous


A tremendous bell note explodes from your outstretched
hand and rolls forward in a line 30 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each creature in the line must make a successful Constitution saving throw or be deafened for 1 minute. A creature made of material such as stone, crystal, or metal has disadvantage on its saving throw against this spell.
While a creature is deafened in this way, it is wreathed 
in thundering energy; it takes 2d8 thunder damage at the start of its turn, and its speed is halved. A deafened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 
spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.


ROTTING CORPSE
2nd-level necromancy 
Casting Time: 10 minutesRange: T ouch Components: V , M (a rotting piece of flesh from an 
undead creature)
Duration: 3 days


Y our familiarity with the foul effects of death allows you
to prevent a dead body from being returned to life using anything but the most powerful forms of magic.


Y ou cast this spell by touching a creature that died within
the last 24 hours. The body immediately decomposes to a state that prevents the body from being returned to life by 
104
SPELL DESCRIPTIONSthe raise dead spell (though a resurrection spell still works). 
At the end of this spell’s duration, the body decomposes to a rancid slime, and it can’t be returned to life except through a true resurrection spell. 
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using 
a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can affect one additional corpse for each slot level above 2nd.


RUNE OF IMPRISONMENT
3rd-level abjuration
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 30 feetComponents: V , S, M (ink)Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute


Y ou trace a glowing black rune in the air which streaks
toward and envelops its target. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a successful hit, the rune absorbs the target creature, leaving only the glowing rune hanging in the space the target occupied. The subject can take no actions while imprisoned, nor can the subject be targeted or affected by any means. Any spell durations or conditions affecting the creature are postponed until the creature is freed. A dying creature does not lose hit points or stabilize until freed.


A creature adjacent to the rune can use a move action
to attempt to disrupt its energies; doing so allows the imprisoned creature to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a success, this disruption negates the imprisonment and ends the effect. Disruption can be attempted only once per round.


SACRIFICIAL HEALING
4th-level necromancy (ritual)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: T ouchComponents: V , S, M (a silver knife)Duration: Instantaneous
Y ou heal another creature’s wounds by taking them upon 
yourself or transferring them to another willing creature in range. Roll 4d8. The number rolled is the amount of damage healed by the target and the damage you take, as its wounds close and similar damage appears on your body (or the body of the other willing target of the spell).SAND SHIP
4th-level transmutation (ritual)
Casting Time: 1 minuteRange: 30 feetComponents: V , S, M (a boat or ship of 10,000 gp value 
or less)
Duration: 24 hours


Casting sand ship on a water vessel up to the size of a small
sailing ship transforms it into a vessel capable of sailing on sand as easily as water. The vessel still needs a trained crew and relies on wind or oars for propulsion, but it moves at its normal speed across sand instead of water for the duration of the spell. It can sail only over sand, not soil or solid rock. For the duration of the spell, the vessel doesn’t float; it must be beached or resting on the bottom of a body of water (partially drawn up onto a beach, for example) when the spell is cast, or it sinks into the water.


SCENTLESS
1st-level transmutation
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: T ouchComponents: V , S, M (1 ounce of pure water)Duration: 1 hour


Y ou touch a willing creature or object that is not being
worn or carried. For the duration, the target gives off no odor. A creature that relies on smell has disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks to detect the target and Wisdom (Survival) checks to track the target. The target is invisible to a creature that relies solely on smell to sense its surroundings. This spell has no effect on targets with unusually strong scents, such as ghasts.


SCREAMING RAY
1st-level evocation

Y ou create a ray of psychic energy to attack your enemies. 
Make a ranged spell attack against a creature. On a hit, the target takes 1d4 psychic damage and is deafened until the end of your next turn. If the target succeeds on a Constitution saving throw, it is not deafened.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 
spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you create one additional ray for each slot level above 1st. Y ou can direct the rays at one target or several.

SPELL DESCRIPTIONSSCRIBE
Transmutation cantrip
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: T ouchComponents: V , SDuration: Instantaneous


This spell enables you to create a copy of a one-page
written work by placing a blank piece of paper or parchment near the work that you are copying. All the writing, illustrations, and other elements in the original are reproduced in the new document, in your handwriting or drawing style. The new medium must be large enough to accommodate the original source. Any magical properties of the original aren’t reproduced, so you can’t use scribe to make copies of spell scrolls or magic books.


SEE BEYOND
5th-level divination
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: T ouchComponents: V , S, M (a transparent crystal)Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour


This spell enables a willing creature you touch to see
through any obstructions as if they were transparent. For the duration, the target can see into and through opaque objects, creatures, spells, and effects that obstruct line of sight to a range of 30 feet. Inside that distance, the creature can choose what it perceives as opaque and what it perceives as transparent as freely and as naturally as it can shift its focus from nearby to distant objects.
Although the creature can see any target within 30 feet of 
itself, all other requirements must still be satisfied before casting a spell or making an attack against that target. For example, the creature can see an enemy that has total cover but can’t shoot that enemy with an arrow because the cover physically prevents it. That enemy could be targeted by a geas spell, however, because geas needs only a visible target.


SEEPING DEATH
3rd-level necromancy
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: T ouchComponents: V , SDuration: 3 days
Y our touch inflicts a virulent, flesh-eating disease. Make a 
melee spell attack against a creature within your reach. On a hit, the creature’s Dexterity score is reduced by 1d4, and it is afflicted with the seeping death disease for the duration. Since this spell induces a natural disease in its target, any 
effect that removes a disease or otherwise ameliorates a disease’s effects apply to it and can end the spell early.
Seeping Death. The creature’s flesh is slowly liquefied 
by a lingering necrotic pestilence. At the end of each long rest, the diseased creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or its Dexterity score is reduced by 1d4. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest after the disease is cured. If the disease reduces the creature’s Dexterity to 0, the creature dies.


SHARED SACRIFICE
2nd-level evocation
Casting Time: 1 minuteRange: 60 feetComponents: V , SDuration: 1 hour


Y ou and up to five of your allies within range contribute
part of your life force to create a pool that can be used for healing. Each target takes 5 necrotic damage (which can’t be reduced but can be healed normally), and those donated hit points are channeled into a reservoir of life essence. As an action, any creature who contributed to the pool of hit points can heal another creature by touching it and drawing hit points from the pool into the injured creature. The injured creature heals a number of hit points equal to your spellcasting ability modifier, and the hit points in the pool decrease by the same amount. This process can be repeated until the pool is exhausted or the spell’s duration expires.


SHOCKING SHROUD
4th-level evocation
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: SelfComponents: V , S, M (a bit of fur and a bead of amber, 
crystal, or glass)
Duration: 10 minutes
Arcs of electricity dance over your body for the duration, 
granting you resistance to lightning damage. Y ou can end the spell early by using an action to dismiss it.
In addition, whenever a creature within 5 feet of you 
hits you with a melee attack, arcs of electricity strike your attacker, who takes 2d8 lightning damage.
106


SPELL DESCRIPTIONSSHROUD OF DEATH
4th-level necromancy
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: Self (30-foot radius)Components: V , S, M (a piece of ice)Duration: Concentration, up to 10 rounds


Y ou call up a black veil of necrotic energy that devours the
living. Y ou draw on the life energy of all living creatures within 30 feet of you that you can see. When you cast the spell, every living creature within 30 feet of you that you can see takes 1 necrotic damage, and all those hit points transfer to you as temporary hit points. The damage and the temporary hit points increase to 2 per creature at the start of your second turn concentrating on the spell, 3 per creature at the start of your third turn, and so on. All living creatures you can see within 30 feet of you at the start of each of your turns are affected. A creature can avoid the effect by moving more than 30 feet away from you or by getting out of your line of sight, but it becomes susceptible again if the necessary conditions are met. The temporary hit points last until the spell ends.


SIDESTEP ARROW
3rd-level divination
Casting Time: 1 reaction, which you take when an 
enemy targets you with a ranged attack
Range: SelfComponents: V , SDuration: Instantaneous
With a few perfectly timed steps, you interpose a foe 
between you and danger. Y ou cast this spell when an enemy makes a ranged attack or a ranged spell attack against you but before the attack is resolved. At least one other foe must be within 10 feet of you when you cast sidestep arrow. As part of casting the spell, you can move up to 15 feet to a place where an enemy lies between you and the attacker. If no such location is available, the spell has no effect. Y ou must be able to move (not restrained or grappled or prevented from moving for any other reason), and this move does not provoke opportunity attacks. After you move, the ranged attack is resolved with the intervening foe as the target instead of you.SIR MITTINZ’S MOVE CURSE

Casting Time: 1 bonus actionRange: 30 feetComponents: V , SDuration: Instantaneous


Y ou set a series of small events in motion that cause
the targeted creature to drop one nonmagical item of your choice that it’s currently holding, unless it makes a successful Charisma saving throw.


SMITING ARROW
6th-level evocation (ritual)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: T ouchComponents: V , S, M (an arrow and a drop of blood, 
strand of hair, or small personal item)
Duration: 24 hours
By casting this spell, you imbue a piece of ammunition 
to have greater effect on a specific target. T o this end, you need something directly associated with the creature for which the arrow is intended—a drop of its blood, a strand of its hair, an item of clothing it recently wore, or something similar—which is consumed in the casting of the spell. For the next 24 hours, if the ammunition is used to make a ranged attack against the specific target and it hits, it deals an extra 6d10 radiant damage to the target and stuns it for 1 round. If the target makes a successful Constitution saving throw, it takes half as much radiant damage and is not stunned. If the attack is a critical hit, the creature has disadvantage on its saving throw.

SPELL DESCRIPTIONSSNAP THE LEASH
2nd-level enchantment 
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 30 feetComponents: V , S, M (a used leash or similar object)Duration: Instantaneous
Choose a beast that you can see within range. If the beast’s 
Intelligence is 4 or higher, the spell fails. The beast must make a Wisdom saving throw; on a failed save, you remove the shackles of domestication from the creature’s mind, causing it to entirely forget being broken or trained. Mounts refuse to be ridden, and other animals forget any tricks learned and obedience taught. Other memories are not affected, so creatures might remain drawn to those who have treated them kindly and aggressive toward those who have harmed them. The animal can be domesticated again, but the trainer must start from scratch.


This spell is only partly effective against animal
companions, familiars, and paladin mounts. Although the spell removes any tricks such creatures know, the bond between creature and master is otherwise unaffected.


SOOTHING CHANT
3rd-level abjuration
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: SelfComponents: VDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Intoning a lulling drone, you convince creatures not to do 
you harm. At the beginning of its turn, any creature that can hear you must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is charmed. A creature charmed by soothing chant can still act aggressively toward your allies. If it uses area attacks, the creature will position them so as not to include you in the area. On a successful save, a creature can act against you normally, but it must make another saving throw in every round when you continue to chant and it can hear you.
On your turn, you can use a bonus action to designate 
up to six other creatures that the charmed creatures will not attack.
The effects last for the duration or until you (or any other 
designated creatures) engage in hostile action against a charmed creature or in its presence. Any creature that you attack or target with a harmful spell, or that sees you attack or cast a harmful spell against another charmed creature, is no longer affected by this spell and can act normally against you (or against any creature you designated).SOUL BORROWING
3rd-level necromancy
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: T ouchComponents: V , S, M (a polished vampire’s fang)Duration: 1 minute
By touching a creature, you gain one sense, movement 
mode and speed, feat, language, immunity, or other nonmagical ability of the target for the duration of the spell. The target also retains the use of the borrowed ability. An unwilling target prevents the effect with a successful Constitution saving throw. The target can be a living creature or one that has been dead no longer than 1 minute; a corpse automatically fails the saving throw. Y ou can possess only one borrowed ability at a time.
At Higher Levels.
 When you cast this spell using a 
spell slot of 5th level or higher, its duration increases to 1 
hour and the target loses the stolen power for the duration of the spell.


SPEAK WITH INANIMATE OBJECT
1st-level divination (ritual)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: T ouchComponents: V , SDuration: 10 minutes


Y ou awaken a spirit that resides inside an inanimate object
such as a rock, a sign, or a table, and can ask it up to three yes-or-no questions. The spirit is indifferent toward you unless you have done something to harm or help it. The spirit can give you information about its environment and about things it has observed (with its limited senses), and it can act as a spy for you in certain situations. The spell ends when its duration expires or after you have received answers to three questions.


SPECTRAL HERD
4th level conjuration
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 30 feetComponents: V , SDuration: 1 minute


Y ou summon a spectral herd of ponies to drag off a
creature that you can see within range. The target must be Large or smaller. If it gets a failure on a Dexterity saving throw, a spectral rope wraps around the target, which falls prone and is restrained. It is immediately pulled 60 feet behind the galloping herd, in a direction of your choosing. The target also takes 3d6 bludgeoning damage from being dragged across the ground.
108
SPELL DESCRIPTIONSWhile the target is restrained in this way, it is dragged 
another 60 feet and takes another 3d6 bludgeoning 
damage at the start of each of your turns. The ponies continue running in the chosen direction for the duration of the spell. Once the direction is chosen, you can’t change it, but the ponies do swerve around impassable obstacles. They ignore difficult terrain and are immune to damage.


The restrained creature can escape by using its action
to make a successful Strength or Dexterity check against your spell DC. The spectral rope can’t be severed.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 
spell slot of 5th level or higher, one additional creature can be targeted for each slot level above 4th.


SPIN
2nd-level enchantment [clockwork]
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 60 feetComponents: V , SDuration: 1 minute


Y ou designate a creature you can see within range and
tell it to spin. The creature can resist this command with a successful Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature spins in place for the duration of the spell. A spinning creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. A creature that has spun for 1 round or longer becomes dizzy and has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until 1 round after it stops spinning.


SPITEFUL WEAPON
3rd-level necromancy
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 25 feetComponents: V , S, M (a melee weapon that has been 
used to injure the target)
Duration: Concentration, up to 5 rounds
Y ou create a connection between the target of the spell, an 
attacker that injured the target during the last 24 hours, and the melee weapon that caused the injury, all of which must be within range when the spell is cast.
For the duration of the spell, whenever the attacker takes 
damage while holding the weapon, the target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes the same amount and type of damage, or half as much damage on a successful one. The attacker can use the weapon on itself and thus cause the target to take identical damage. A self-inflicted wound hits automatically, but damage is still rolled randomly. Once the connection is established, it lasts for the 
duration of the spell regardless of range, so long as all three elements remain on the same plane. The spell ends immediately if the attacker receives any healing.
At Higher Levels. The target has disadvantage on its 
Charisma saving throws if spiteful weapon is cast using a spell slot of 5th level or higher.


SPUR MOUNT
1st-level transmutation

can slip under doors, between shutters, and through the narrowest of cracks. Y ou can stretch your shadow up to ten times your height and move it as you desire. It remains 
two-dimensional and cannot interact with physical objects. 
Y ou can spy through your shadow’s eyes and ears as if 
they were your own, but magically enhanced senses do not work through this spell. Y ou can utilize the Stealth skill normally if trying to keep your shadow’s presence a secret: it gains advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks in dim lighting but disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks in brightly lit areas.


STAFF OF VIOLET FIRE
4th-level evocation
Casting Time: 1 bonus actionRange: SelfComponents: V , S, M (mummy dust)Duration: Concentration, but see description


Y ou create a quarterstaff of pure necrotic energy that
blazes with intense purple light; it appears in your chosen hand. If you let it go, it disappears, though you can evoke it again as a bonus action if you have maintained concentration on the spell.
109


SPELL DESCRIPTIONSThis staff is an extremely unstable and impermanent
magic item; it has 10 charges and does not require 
attunement. The wielder can use one of three effects:
• By using your action to make a melee attack and expending 1 charge, you can attack with it. On a hit, the target takes 5d10 necrotic damage.
• By expending 2 charges, you can release bolts of necrotic fire against up to 3 targets as ranged attacks for 1d8+4 necrotic damage each.


The staff disappears and the spell ends when all the staff 's
charges have been expended or if you stop concentrating on the spell.

enemy starts its turn
Range: 100 feetComponents:

compelling fate, and lasts up to 1 minute). At the end of each of its turns, the target repeats the Charisma saving throw, ending the effect on a success.

Choose one creature you can see within range that isn’t 
a construct or an undead. The target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or become cursed for the duration of the spell. While cursed, the target reeks of death and rot, and nothing short of magic can mask or remove the smell. The target has disadvantage on all Charisma checks and on Constitution saving throws to maintain concentration on spells. A creature with the Keen Smell trait, or a similar trait indicating the creature has a strong sense of smell, can add your spellcasting ability modifier to its Wisdom
 
(Perception) or Wisdom (Survival) checks to find the target. A remove curse spell or similar magic ends the spell early.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the duration increases by 1 hour for each slot level above 2nd.

3rd-level transmutation
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: SelfComponents: V , S, M (a live scorpion)Duration: 10 minutes
Y ou grow a large scorpion’s tail, complete with venomous 
stinger. While the spell is in effect, you can use a bonus action to make a melee attack with the stinger against an opponent within 5 feet. On a hit, you deal 1d6 piercing damage and 2d8 poison damage, and the target is poisoned for 1 minute. A creature hit by your stinger attack makes a Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, it takes just half the poison damage and is not poisoned.


STORM FORM
6th-level transmutation
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: SelfComponents: V , S, M (a piece of wet wool)Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
Y ou transform into a living storm cloud, becoming a 
swirling mass of black clouds illuminated from within by flickers of lightning.
While in this form, your only method of movement is a 
flying speed of 60 feet. Y ou can enter and occupy the space of another creature. Y ou have resistance to nonmagical damage, immunity to lightning damage, and advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws. If a creature strikes you with a melee weapon attack, it takes 3d8 lightning damage. Y ou can pass through small holes, narrow openings, and even mere cracks, but you treat liquids as if they were solid surfaces. Y ou can’t fall, and you remain hovering in the air even if stunned or otherwise incapacitated. Y ou cannot talk or manipulate objects in storm cloud form, and any objects you were carrying or holding can’t be used, dropped, or interacted with in any way. Y ou cannot cast spells while in this form.
As an action, you can attack an opponent up to 30 feet 
away, dealing 3d8 lightning damage on a hit. Y ou can also use an action to bring down rain upon a 5-foot square within your reach, drenching it and putting out any nonmagical fires in that area.
Finally, you can use an action to expand your form to 
encompass a 20-foot-radius area, unleashing the storm’s full fury in a burst of rain, wind, lightning, and thunder. Each creature in the area is drenched with rain, takes 3d8 lightning and 3d8 thunder damage, is deafened for 1d4 rounds, and is knocked prone. A successful Constitution saving throw halves the damage and negates the deafened and prone conditions. T aking this action uses up any remaining duration of the spell, and you resume your normal form at the end of your turn.
STORM GOD’S DOOM
3rd-level evocation
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 60 feetComponents: V , SDuration: Instantaneous


A powerful wind swirls from your outstretched hand
toward a point you choose within range, where it explodes with a low roar into vortex of air. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius cylinder centered on that point must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 3d8 bludgeoning damage, is pulled to the center of the cylinder, and is thrown 50 feet upward into the air. If a creature hits a solid obstruction when it’s thrown upward (such as a stone ceiling), it takes bludgeoning damage as if it had fallen 50 feet, minus the distance it traveled upward. For example, if a creature hits the ceiling after rising only 10 feet, it takes bludgeoning damage as if it had fallen 40 feet, or 4d6 bludgeoning damage.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using 
a spell slot of 4th level or higher, increase the distance affected creatures are thrown into the air by 10 feet for each slot level above 3rd.

5th-level transmutation
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: T ouch Components: V , SDuration: Concentration, up to 1 hour
The sun’s life-giving energy heals and sustains your body 
or that of a creature you touch. For the duration, you heal 1 hit point at the start of each of your turns whenever you are bathed in direct sunlight; 30 minutes or more of exposure also provides a day’s normal nourishment.
In dim light, the spell’s healing is reduced to 1 hit point

reaction per round.
Petrified: The target gains a +2 bonus to AC.

3rd-level divination
Casting Time: 1 bonus actionRange: SelfComponents: VDuration: Instantaneous
Twisting the knife, slapping with the butt of the spear, 
slashing out again as you recover from a lunge, and countless other double-strike maneuvers are skillful ways to get more from your weapon. By casting this spell as a bonus action after making a successful melee weapon attack, you deal an extra 2d6 damage of the weapon’s type to the target. In addition, if your weapon attack roll was a 19 or higher, it is a critical hit and increases the weapon’s damage dice as normal.

point becomes the top center of a cylinder 10 feet in radius and 40 feet deep. All ice inside that area melts immediately. The uppermost layer of ice seems to remain intact and sturdy, but it covers a 40-foot-deep pit filled with ice water. A successful Wisdom (Survival) check or passive Perception check against your spell save DC notices the thin ice. If a creature weighing more than 20 pounds (or a greater weight specified by you when casting the spell) treads over the cylinder or is already standing on it, the ice gives way. Unless the creature makes a successful Dexterity saving throw, it falls into the icy water, taking 2d6 cold damage plus whatever other problems are caused by water, by armor, or by being drenched in a freezing environment. The water gradually refreezes normally.


THORN CAGE

ground around a target of your choice. The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be restrained by the thorny vines until the spell ends.

2nd-level transmutation
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: T ouchComponents: S, M (a maple catkin)Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour


One willing creature you touch gains a climbing speed
equal to its walking speed. This climbing speed functions only while the creature is in contact with a living plant or fungus that’s growing from the ground. The creature can cling to an appropriate surface with just one hand or with just its feet, leaving its hands free to wield weapons or cast spells. The plant doesn’t give under the creature’s weight, so the creature can walk on the tiniest of tree branches, stand on a leaf, or run across the waving top of a field of wheat without bending a stalk or touching the ground.


TREE SPEAK
1st-level divination
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: T ouchComponents: V , SDuration: 1 minute


Y ou touch a tree and ask one question about anything
that might have happened in its immediate vicinity (such as “Who passed by here?”). Y ou get a mental sensation of the response, which lasts for the duration of the spell. T rees do not have a humanoid’s sense of time, so the tree might speak about something that happened last night or a hundred years ago. The sensation you receive might include sight, hearing, vibration, or smell, all from the tree’s perspective. T rees are particularly attentive to anything that might harm the forest and always report such activities when questioned.

A golden radiance spreads out from you, providing bright 
light up to 30 feet away, and dim light for an additional 30 feet. Any creatures or objects in the area of bright light that are invisible become visible while they are within 30 feet of you. Likewise, any magical disguises or illusions within 30 feet of you become feeble and transparent, their illusory nature obvious. These magical effects return to full potency if they move more than 30 feet away from you, or vice versa.
When a creature that has taken a different form—
through spells such as polymorph or shapechange, or from inborn abilities, such as a druid’s wildshape feature—enters the bright light, it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be forced to return to its original form. Likewise, a creature attempting to change shape within

attack roll, saving throw, or skill check. Roll a d20 and subtract 10 to produce a number from 10 to –9. Add that number to the creature’s roll. This adjustment can turn a failure into a success or vice versa, or it might not change the outcome at all.


UNCANNY AVOIDANCE
Divination cantrip
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 30 feetComponents: SDuration: Concentration, up to 1 round


Y ou extend a hand and point a finger at a creature within

UNHOLY DEFIANCE
2nd-level necromancy 
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 30 feetComponents: V , S, M (a pinch of earth from a grave)Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Until the spell ends, undead creatures within range have 
advantage on saving throws against effects that turn undead. If an undead creature within this area has the T urning Defiance trait, that creature can roll a d4 when it makes a saving throw against an effect that turns undead and add the number rolled to the saving throw.


UNLEASH EFFIGY
9th-level transmutation
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 60 feetComponents: V , SDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
Y ou cause a stone statue that you can see within 60 feet of 
you to animate as your ally. The statue has the statistics of a stone golem. It takes a turn immediately after your turn. As a bonus action on your turn, you can order the golem to move and attack, provided you’re within 60 feet of it. Without orders from you, the statue does nothing.
Whenever the statue has 75 hit points or fewer at the 
start of your turn or it is more than 60 feet from you at the start of your turn, you must make a successful DC 16 spellcasting check or the statue goes berserk. On each of its turns, the berserk statue attacks you or one of your allies. If no creature is near enough to be attacked, the statue dashes toward the nearest one instead. Once the statue goes berserk, it remains berserk until it’s destroyed.
When the spell ends, the animated statue reverts to a 
normal, mundane statue.

When you cast this spell, your face momentarily becomes 
that of a demon lord, frightful enough to drive enemies mad. Every foe that’s within 30 feet of you and that can see you must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature claws savagely at its eyes, dealing piercing damage to itself equal to 1d6 + the creature’s Strength modifier.

SPELL DESCRIPTIONSVISAGE OF THE DEAD
4th-level necromancy (ritual)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: T ouchComponents: V , S, M (a sliver of bone or piece of skin 
from an animated skeleton or zombie)
Duration: 8 hours
Y ou infuse yourself, and up to four creatures you touch, 
with necromantic energy, taking on aspects of the undead. The targets gain immunity to poison damage and the poisoned condition for the duration of the spell, and take on appearances similar to undead versions of themselves.


Undead that encounter a creature under the effect of this
spell must make an Intelligence saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the undead mistakes the target for another undead creature. Typically this means the undead will ignore the target, especially if it is a less intelligent one such as a skeleton or a zombie, unless it is commanded otherwise. The response of more intelligent undead might depend on the conditions under which the encounter occurs, but if the target’s presence would not be unusual, they too might likely ignore the target unless it acts suspiciously.


VOLLEY SHIELD
7th-level abjuration
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: T ouchComponents: SDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute


Y ou touch a willing creature and create a shimmering
shield of energy to protect it. The shield grants the target a +5 bonus to AC and gives it resistance against nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage for the duration of the spell.
In addition, the shield can reflect hostile spells back 
at their casters. When the target makes a successful saving throw against a hostile spell, the caster of the spell immediately becomes the spell’s new target. The caster is entitled to the appropriate saving throw against the returned spell, if any, and is affected by the spell as if it came from a spellcaster of the caster’s level.VOMIT TENTACLES
2nd level transmutation
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: SelfComponents: V , S, M (a piece of a tentacle)Duration: 5 rounds
Y our jaws distend and dozens of thin, slimy tentacles 
emerge from your mouth to grasp and bind your opponents. Make a melee spell attack against a foe within 15 feet of you. On a hit, the target takes bludgeoning damage equal to 2d6 + your Strength modifier and is grappled (escape DC equal to your spell save DC). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained and it takes the same damage at the start of each of your turns. Y ou can grapple only one creature at a time.
The Armor Class of the tentacles is equal to yours. If 
they take slashing damage equal to 5 + your Constitution modifier from a single attack, enough tentacles are severed to enable a grappled creature to escape. Severed tentacles are replaced by new ones at the start of your turn. Damage dealt to the tentacles doesn’t affect your hit points.
While the spell is in effect, you are incapable of speech

7th-level transmutation
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 30 feetComponents: V , S, M (100 miniature axes)Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes


This spell creates a wall of swinging axes from the pile of
miniature axes you provide when casting the spell. The wall fills a rectangle 10 feet wide, 10 feet high, and 20 feet long. The wall has a base speed of 50 feet, but it can’t take the Dash action. It can make up to four attacks per round on your turn, using your spell attack modifier to hit and with a reach of 10 feet. Y ou direct the wall’s movement and attacks as a bonus action. If you choose not to direct it, the wall continues trying to execute the last command you gave it. The wall can’t use reactions. Each successful attack deals 4d6 slashing damage, and the damage is considered magical
.
The wall has AC 12 and 200 hit points, and is immune 
to necrotic, poison, psychic, and piercing damage. If it is reduced to 0 hit points or when the spell’s duration ends, the wall disappears and the miniature axes fall to the ground in a tidy heap.

SPELL DESCRIPTIONSWALK THE TWISTED PATH
6th-level conjuration (labyrinth)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: Self (20-foot radius)Components: V , S, M (a map)Duration: Special
When you cast this spell, you and up to five creatures you 
can see within 20 feet of you enter a shifting landscape of endless walls and corridors that connect to many places throughout the world.
Y ou can find your way to a destination within 100 miles, 
as long as you know for certain that your destination exists (though you don’t need to have seen or visited it before), and you must make a successful DC 20 Intelligence check. If you have the ability to retrace a path you have previously taken without making a check (as a minotaur or a goristro can), this check automatically succeeds. On a failed check, you don't find your path this round, and you and your companions each take 4d6 psychic damage as the madness of the shifting maze exacts its toll. Y ou must repeat the check at the start of each of your turns until you find your way to your destination or until you die. In either event, the spell ends.
When the spell ends, you and those traveling with you 
appear in a safe location at your destination.

spell slot of 7th level or higher, you can bring along two additional creatures or travel an additional 100 miles for each slot level above 6th.

or ranged attack is made against you
Range: 60 feetComponents: V , SDuration: Instantaneous


Y ou create a tear in the fabric of reality that protects you
from an incoming attack by directing it through a second tear close to a creature you can see up within range.

Y ou can even make the attacker hit itself, if you choose.

your head and give off dim light out to a radius of 15 feet. Whenever a Large or smaller enemy enters that area of dim light, or starts its turn in the area, you can use your reaction to attack it with one or more of the orbs. The enemy creature makes a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is pushed 20 feet directly away from you, and each orb you used in the attack explodes violently, dealing 1d6 force damage to the creature.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using

Y ou create a 30-foot-radius sphere of roiling wind that 
carries the choking stench of death. The sphere is centered on a point you choose within range. The wind blows around corners. When a creature starts its turn in the sphere, it takes 8d8 necrotic damage, or half as much damage if it makes a successful Constitution saving throw. Creatures are affected even if they hold their breath or don’t need to breathe.
The sphere moves 10 feet away from you at the start 
of each of your turns, drifting along the surface of the ground. It is not heavier than air but drifts in a straight line for the duration of the spell, even if that carries it over a cliff or gully. If the sphere meets a wall or other impassable obstacle, it turns to the left or right (select randomly).WIND TUNNEL
1st-level evocation
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: Self (60-foot line)Components: V , S, M (a paper straw)Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute


Y ou create a swirling tunnel of strong wind extending
from yourself in a direction you choose. The tunnel is a line 
60 feet long and 10 feet wide. The wind blows from you toward the end of the line, which is stationary once created. A creature in the line moving with the wind (away from you) adds 10 feet to its speed, and ranged weapon attacks launched with the wind don’t have disadvantage because of long range. Creatures in the line moving against the wind (toward you) spend 2 feet of movement for every 1 foot they move, and ranged weapon attacks launched along the line against the wind are made with disadvantage
.
The wind tunnel immediately disperses gas or vapor, and 
it extinguishes candles, torches, and similar unprotected flames in the line. It causes protected flames, such as those of lanterns, to dance wildly and has a 50 percent chance of extinguishing them.

This spell has no effect on a creature that is blind or that doesn’t use its eyes to see.

If you cast the spell indoors and aboveground, the howl 
can be heard out to 200 feet from you. If you cast the spell underground, the howl can be heard from 100 feet away. A creature that understands the message is not compelled to act in a particular way, though the nature of the message might suggest or even dictate a course of action.

spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can name another specific recipient for each slot level above 2nd.


WRESTING WIND
2nd-level evocation 
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 90 feetComponents: V , S, M (a handful of paper confetti)Duration: Instantaneous
By blowing a pinch of confetti from your cupped hand, you 
create a burst of air that can rip weapons and other items out of the hands of your enemies. Each enemy in a 20-foot radius centered on a point you target within range must 
make a successful Strength saving throw or drop anything held in its hands. The objects land 10 feet away from the creatures that dropped them, in random directions.


WRITHING ARMS
1st-level transmutation

Y our arms become constantly writhing tentacles. Y ou 
can use your action to make a melee spell attack against any target within range. The target takes 1d10 necrotic damage and is grappled (escape DC is your spell save DC). If the target does not escape your grapple, you can use your action on each subsequent turn to deal 1d10 necrotic damage to the target automatically.
Although you control the tentacles, they make it difficult 
to manipulate items. Y ou cannot wield weapons or hold objects, including material components, while under the effects of this spell.
At Higher Levels.


When you cast this spell using a spell
slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage you deal with your 
tentacle attack increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 
1st.

CLASS  OPTIONS
No two spellcasters are alike, and making each one 
stand out is part of the fun of playing such a character. This section includes nearly three dozen new options for spellcasting types, including the expected wizards, sorcerers, and warlocks, as well as fifteen new divine domains, four druid circles, two bard colleges, a pair of options for paladins and rangers, and even an arcane fighter. Browse the possibilities and see what inspires your next magic-slinging character!


Bard College
At 3rd level, a bard gains the Bard College feature. The following options are available to a bard, in addition to those in the standard rules.


COLLEGE OF WYRDSINGERS
Bards of the College of Wyrdsingers subscribe to the wyrd, a philosophy that centers around the phenomenon of the same name. The wyrd is that which will be, inexorably tied to such concepts as destiny and fate. Though some might 
consider the idea of a fixed destiny fatalistic, the bards of this college are inspired by this viewpoint. One may not 
choose the manner of one’ s death, but one can choose how 
to meet it, and that idea is at the heart of this college. An insect might be caught in a spider ’s web. Whether it lives or 
dies, its struggles ultimately shake the web in its entirety, 
and it might free itself through such effort. The struggle affects all things, however remotely connected they might be, whereas the insect that merely accepts its death leaves not even a ripple behind. T o confront fate, to embrace the wyrd and whatever it brings, is to have the power to shake 
the world and make it take notice.


BRAGGART
When you join the College of Wyrdsingers at 3rd level, 
you are already a master of the art of bragging about your deeds. The fact that you exaggerate is of little importance; what matters is that boasting of your deeds makes people listen to you. Y our proficiency bonus is doubled


Class Options

(Persuasion) check.


INSPIRE GREATNESS
Also beginning at 3rd level, you can use a bonus action to instill a sense of worth in a single ally within 60 feet who can hear you. Y our ally gains a bonus equal to your Charisma modifier on attack rolls, damage rolls, ability checks, and saving throws for a number of rounds equal to your bard level. That ally cannot benefit from your Bardic Inspiration until the duration of this feature has run its course. Y ou can use this feature once at 3rd level, twice at 8th level, and three times at 15th level. Y ou regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. 
Additionally, you can use a bonus action to cast any 
abjuration spell you know that normally takes 1 action to cast (for example, laugh in the face of fear, described in this book, or lesser restoration). Once you use this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can use it again.


NOT THIS DAY
Starting at 6th level, if an ally of yours drops to 0 hit points, you can use a reaction to expend one of your uses of Bardic Inspiration. Y our ally gains a number of temporary hit points equal to the die roll and remains conscious. If the attack that reduced the ally to 0 hit points would have been fatal, the ally will die if they lose all temporary hit points they currently possess, unless their hit point total is raised to 1 or higher before that happens.


MAKE YOUR OWN FATE
At 14th level and higher, you can use an action to sing a song of valor that enables you to remain courageous and fight fiercely in the face of the gravest danger. For 1 minute thereafter, you gain immunity to the frightened condition.

In addition, while this feature is in effect, you add your Charisma modifier to your weapon damage and to the damage of any spell you cast.


GREENLEAF COLLEGE
The Greenleaf College was founded by half-elves who sought to celebrate their varied heritage. Drawing from elven lore for inspiration and power, Greenleaf bards strengthen their connection to nature. Through their magic and their tales, they convey the rejuvenating strength of the forests and rivers to their allies.


BONUS PROFICIENCIES
When you join the Greenleaf College at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in Nature and two other skills of your choice.REJUVENATING INSPIRATION
At 3rd level , you learn to infuse your Bardic Inspiration

LAND’S STRIDE
Beginning at 6th level, moving through nonmagical difficult terrain costs you no extra movement. Y ou can also pass through nonmagical plants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar feature.

The temperature plummets; all creatures other than you in the darkened sphere at the end of their turns must make a successful Constitution saving throw or take 1d8 cold damage.

As civilization expands into inhospitable terrain and environments, its reliance increases on divine providence to ensure survivability.


Good-aligned clerics appeal to winter deities such as
Boreas to spare their people the worst of bitter cold, storms that last for days, and other calamities caused by weather. They couch the onset of winter as necessary for strengthening their people and as a respite from toil, pointing to the peacefulness of the frozen, snow-draped landscape. Evil clerics embrace the storms and brutal conditions and even enhance them to advance their deities’ agendas and to spread fear through their enemies.

At 2nd level, a druid gains the Druid Circle feature. The 
following options are available to a druid, in addition to those in the standard rules.


CIRCLE OF OAKS
There is power in the ancient trees of the world—a quiet, abiding power. Those who live among trees, like the elves, are aware of this power, and they treat it with respect, even reverence. Some druids learn to tap into this power. These are the members of the Circle of Oaks. By suffusing themselves with the vitality and strength of the ancient green, they can perform mighty feats. Although they commonly hail from the ancient forests of the world, Circle of Oaks druids can be found anywhere there are trees of sufficient age from which to draw power.

Starting at 6th level, you can spend half your movement to magically step into a tree and transport yourself through it and out of another tree of the same kind within 60 feet, reappearing in a space of your choice within 5 feet of the destination tree. Y ou can use this feature twice when you reach 10th level, and three times at 14th level, when the range becomes 120 feet. Y ou regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.


MIGHT OF THE OAK
At 10th level, you can expend two uses of Wild Shape at the same time to transform into a tree-like humanoid, similar to a treant, though not as powerful. While in this form, you are a Large plant, and you have the following statistics:

target. Hit: 21 (3d10 + 5) bludgeoning damage.ROUSE THE GROVE
At 14th level, you can use an action on your turn to stir 
the trees around you, bringing them to your aid. All trees within 60 feet of you become animated, their roots churning the earth and their branches whipping and slashing. All spaces within 15 feet of a tree are considered difficult terrain for your enemies, but not for you or your allies. A creature concentrating on a spell that starts its turn in one of the affected spaces must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or lose concentration on the spell. 
Also, you can use a bonus action on your turn to cause 
one affected tree to strike a creature within 15 feet of it with a branch. Make an attack roll, using your spellcasting ability modifier as a bonus to the roll. On a hit, the creature takes 4d6 bludgeoning damage. Y ou can use this feature for a number of rounds equal to your druid level; these rounds need not be consecutive. Y ou regain the full use of this feature when you finish a long rest.
If this feature is used underground, beneath an area 
where trees grow, the effect is the same, except it is the 
trees’ roots that burst through walls into rooms or tunnels, 
producing the same effects. If the GM decides the area is too far underground or is otherwise unsuitable for this 
feature to be used, it has no effect.


CIRCLE OF OWLS
Druids of the Circle of Owls maintain their tradition 
of spying and gathering knowledge and, occasionally, of permanently silencing those who would misuse knowledge. The Circle of Owls druids draw on the power of their namesakes, moving about the world unnoticed as 
they see and hear what others try desperately to hide.

Starting at 2nd level, you can expend one use of your Wild Shape as an action to create a floral perfume that manipulates the minds of those who breathe it.

On each of your turns while the perfume lasts, you can use an action to choose a different creature within 10 feet of you to affect with your perfume. 
On a failed save, the creature is charmed by you 
or frightened (your choice) for as long as it remains in the area of your perfume and for 1 minute after it leaves the area. If it ends its turn outside the area, the creature can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. If you or your allies attack or harm a charmed creature, it is no longer charmed.
If the creature’s saving throw is successful or if the 
effect ends for it, it is immune to your perfume for the next 24 hours. A creature that doesn’t breathe or that is immune to poison is immune to your perfume.
The perfume lasts for 10 minutes or until you use your 
Wild Shape again.

At 6th level, your perfume can affect one creature of your choice within 20 feet of you, and you can use the scent to offset harmful effects.

The condition removed can be charmed, frightened, or poisoned. 
ROSE’S THORNS

When a creature within 20 feet of you hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to force the creature to make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC.

In addition, you can intensify the power of your 
perfume. When a creature becomes charmed or frightened from your Bittersweet Perfume, you can use a bonus action to wrap some of your perfume around it. That creature is considered to be in the area of your perfume, no matter how far it moves away from you, for 1 hour or until you use your Wild Shape again. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

CLASS  OPTIONSCIRCLE OF THE SPIRITS
Some druids tend to more than the land. They also show

SPIRIT GUIDE
Starting at 2nd level, you gain the service of a minor spirit guide. Y ou can cast find familiar as a ritual.
As long as you and your spirit guide (familiar) are within 
100 feet of each other, the spirit guide can maintain concentration on a druid spell you cast. Y ou must choose whether to do so yourself or make your spirit guide responsible for maintaining concentration at the moment the spell is cast, and that decision can’t be changed on a later turn. Y ou can still have only one concentration spell in effect at a time; if you concentrate on a different spell or effect, the spirit guide’s concentration ends. Y ou can still share your spirit guide’s senses and cast touch spells through the spirit guide normally while it’s maintaining concentration. The spirit guide makes Constitution saving throws to maintain concentration when it takes damage, not when you take damage.

CONSTANT VIGILANCE
Beginning at 7th level, you have a preternatural awareness of your surroundings in times of duress. If you are surprised but not incapacitated at the start of combat, you can use your Action Surge to negate surprise for yourself and take a normal turn plus one additional action (from the Action Surge) in the first round of combat. Additionally, using your Action Surge in this way allows you to give sufficient warning to allies who are within 15 feet of you, so they can also start taking reactions after your turn.


EVASION
At 10th level, your foreknowledge of events to come allows you to position yourself in the most advantageous manner. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.


ANTICIPATORY STRIKE
At 15th level, your innate connection to the threads of fate strengthens, providing greater insight into the movements and actions of your opponents. When you use your Action Surge, you have advantage on attack rolls and a +2 bonus to your AC until the end of your next turn.


ACTION FREE OF THOUGHT
At 18th level, your mastery of divination and temporal effects is such that you are able to react to your opponents without conscious thought and with minimal physical effort. During combat, you can take one reaction every turn instead of one per round.
141


CLASS  OPTIONSSacred Oaths
At 3rd level, a paladin gains the Sacred Oath feature. The 
following options are available to a paladin, in addition to those in the standard rules.


OATH OF RADIANCE
The Oath of Radiance is a beacon in the night, burning away the corruption of shadow and undeath. Radiant paladins are bold and brash, abhorring stealth and grandly striding into battle against the forces of darkness.Paladins of the Oath of Radiance are overwhelmingly good-aligned, and most are lawful. Some reject the rigid nature of knightly orders for the life of a knight errant. Though still nearly universally good, these wayward paladins are more neutral than lawful, and they use their relative freedom to bring their light to bear as they deem it necessary.


TENETS OF RADIANCE
Paladins who swear the Oath of Radiance devote themselves to fighting the insidious powers that darken mortal hearts and against the undead that extinguish the light of life and replace it with hungry darkness. Most important, they take it upon themselves to rescue those corrupted by shadow or undead influence. They will spare mortal foes held in the thrall of darkness in the hope that such creatures can be redeemed.
Cleanse Corruption. I will burn out all creatures born of 
darkness, showing no pity or mercy. I will not suffer the company of dark creatures, save those taken in by darkness whom I might redeem.
Lead with Light. I stand open and courageous in the face 
of battle and will be the last of my companions to quit the field, just as the last ray of sun leaves the day.
Preserve the Righteous. I will defend those who labor and 
live in fear of shadow. I will shield them from harm and keep the light upon them.Redeem the Beguiled. Those tempted into the service of 
darkness may yet be saved, and I will do everything in my power to bring them back to the light. I will be discerning in offering this mercy, but the redemption of the corrupted is paramount.
Remain Pure. I will never yield to the lies of darkness or 
suffer corruption to take me. I will cleanse myself of dark taint or die before threatening those I defend.


OATH SPELLS
Y ou gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed.

* Described in this book


CHANNEL DIVINITY
When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.
Dawn’s Radiance. As an action, you present your holy 
symbol or a melee weapon, and it flares with the radiance of the newly risen sun. Magical darkness within 20 feet of you is dispelled. Thereafter, the object continues to shine for 1 hour or until you lose possession of it. The object sheds bright light out to 20 feet and dim light for an additional 20 feet.
An undead creature, a creature native to the plane of 
shadow, or any creature harmed by sunlight (such as a creature with the Sunlight Sensitivity feature) suffers pain and disorientation when bathed in this radiance. The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls and on Dexterity (Stealth) and Wisdom (Perception) checks while it, the target of its attack, or anything it is trying to perceive is in the bright light shed by the holy symbol or weapon.
Turn the Corrupted. As an action, you present your 
holy symbol and speak a prayer against the corruptive power of death and shadow, using your Channel Divinity. Each undead or creature native to the plane of shadow that is within 30 feet of you and that can see or hear you must make a successful Wisdom saving throw or be turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage.


AURA OF RESOLVE
Beginning at 7th level, you and your allies within 10 feet of you have advantage on saving throws against spells and effects created by undead creatures and by creatures native 
to the plane of shadow. This benefit lasts until someone fails 

142


CLASS  OPTIONSa saving throw that was made with advantage because of
your Aura of Resolve. Once that happens, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use this feature again.
At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.


SOUL OF LIGHT
Starting at 15th level, you have resistance to necrotic damage, and your ability scores and hit point maximum can’t be reduced by any effect.


RADIANT CHAMPION
At 20th level, as an action, you can suffuse your being with divine radiance that brings life and burns away dark corruption. For 1 minute, you gain the following benefits:
• At the start of each of your turns, you regain 10 hit points.
• Once on your turn when you hit an undead creature or a creature native to the plane of shadow, it must make a successful Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or be incapacitated until the end of its next turn.
• An undead creature or a creature native to the plane of shadow that touches you or hits you with a melee attack from 5 feet away takes 2d8 radiant damage.
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you 
finish a long rest.


OATH OF THUNDER
Paladins who swear the Oath of Thunder are even more reserved and humble in daily life than other paladins. That veneer splits like a thunderclap in battle, when they erupt as vicious hellions. Indeed, thundering paladins love to strike “thunder-wise,” meaning suddenly and with surprise, appearing like a bolt of lightning in their enemies’ midst before those enemies know what hit them. Paladins of the Oath of Thunder are often devoted to the cause of good but care little about the struggle between law and chaos.


TENETS OF THUNDER
The Oath of Thunder stresses moderation and clear purpose in daily life, along with crushing, decisive strikes on the battlefield. Paladins sworn to Thunder see aberrations and fiends as the ultimate forces of corruption in the world and strive tirelessly to thwart their designs.
Composure Is My Shield. My deeds are my armor, and 
I am not easily provoked. If anyone shall insult me, I shall laugh at their ignorance. If anyone shall insult my companions, I shall show them their error.
Crush the Abomination. Twisted creatures from beyond 
the world have no place in it. Aberrations and fiends will feel my blade and know death.Decisiveness in Battle. When the time for words has 
passed, I will strike first to bring a swift end to my enemies. 
Duty Above All. Though I drink with the gods and laugh 
with the valkyries, I will stand my watch. I will defend my nation. I will defend my companions.
Humility in Life. I am the Thunder’s servant, not its 
master. I will live without excess, assured in my own strength without ostentation. Charity and courage are twins
.
Voice Like Thunder. My voice rings clear and true in 
defense of those who can’t speak out for themselves. I will 
speak the truth, because such words echo through the ages.

BONUS PROFICIENCY

CHANNEL DIVINITY
When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.
Storm Strike. As an action, you can use your Channel 
Divinity to infuse a ranged or thrown weapon you are holding with the wrath of a storm god. Make a ranged weapon attack as normal. In addition to the weapon attack, you create a line of lightning 5 feet wide and 60 feet long that extends from you straight toward the target. If the target is less than 60 feet from you, the line of lightning continues beyond it. Each creature in the line takes lightning damage equal to 2d10 + your paladin level, or half the damage with a successful Dexterity saving throw. If your ranged or thrown weapon attack hits, the target has disadvantage on its saving throw.
Turn the Unclean. As an action, you present your holy 
symbol and utter a war cry, using your Channel Divinity. Each aberration or fiend within 30 feet of you that can see or hear you must make a successful Wisdom saving throw or be turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage.
143


CLASS  OPTIONSAURA OF ALACRITY
Beginning at 7th level, you and any allies within 10 feet of 
you add your proficiency bonus to initiative rolls.
At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.


STRIKE LIKE LIGHTNING
Starting at 15th level, when your attack hits a creature that hasn’t yet taken its first turn in this combat, or when you hit a creature you were hidden from when you attacked, that creature has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws until the start of your next turn.


CHILD OF THE STORM
At 20th level, you can take on the aspect of the thunder god. While at rest, you have the gloomy demeanor of a thundercloud. When you go into action, your clothing and hair blow wildly in a wind that arises from nowhere, your eyes flare with lightning, and your voice booms like thunder.
By using an action, you undergo a transformation. For 1 
hour, you gain the following benefits:
• Y ou don’t have disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks because of armor.
• Y ou have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks and initiative rolls.
• Y our weapon attacks deal an extra 1d10 lightning or thunder damage (your choice when you hit).
• As an action, you can unleash a terrifying war cry. Every enemy creature in a 30-foot cone must make a successful Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you for 1 minute. While frightened in this way, the creature must spend its turn trying to move as far away from you as it can. It can’t take reactions. On this turn, the creature can do nothing other than take the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action. A frightened creature that’s more than 30 feet from you and can’t see you repeats the saving throw at the start of its turn, ending the effect on itself on a success. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw can’t be affected by your war cry for 24 hours.
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you 
finish a long rest.Ranger Archetypes
At 3rd level, a ranger gains the Ranger Archetype feature. 
The following options are available to a ranger, in addition to those in the standard rules.


GRIFFON SCOUT
Elves of the forested woodlands and mountain foothills often uphold the tradition of taming and riding griffons, living on the same windswept crags where griffons nest, thus giving themselves the ability to command vast tracts of woodland territory. T rained by elf veterans and beast tamers, rangers of the Griffon Scout archetype learn to move swiftly and stealthily both on foot and while mounted, gathering information on their enemies and mounting devastating hit-and-run raids with precision and coordination. 

144


CLASS  OPTIONSGRIFFON SCOUT MAGIC

Vampire slayers wander remote forests, haunted hills, and fog-bound moors, protecting the common folk of farming villages and cabins at the edge of civilized lands from the creatures of the night. Moving unseen through woodlands, your specialized training allows you to hunt vampires, ghouls, werewolves, and other monsters that prey on the innocent. Although you are most at home in the wilderness, as your skills improve, your attention might turn to older vampires that rule entire baronies, or that command dark keeps and sprawling manors closer to civilization.


FAVORED ENEMY
If you choose this archetype at 3rd level, your favored enemy becomes undead if you did not select undead at 1st level. When you choose additional favored enemies at 6th and 14th level, you can choose freely from the standard list, and you can also select hags or lycanthropes as an alternative.
HUNTER’S PREY
At 3rd level, you gain one of the following features of your choice: either Colossus Slayer, Giant Killer, or Horse Breaker from the Hunter archetype in the standard rules, or Empowered Strike, which is described below.

Y our innate magic comes from your superior bloodline. Y our magic wells up from within you, as a paragon of your race.

SCHOOL MASTERY
At 1st level, you have a natural affinity for a particular school of magic, depending on your race, as shown on the table below. Y ou can cast a particular spell from that school without needing material components, and that bonus spell does not count against your number of sorcerer spells known.

Also starting at 1st level, you can absorb a certain amount of hostile magical energy. Y ou can use this feature as a reaction when you make a successful saving throw against a spell of a level that is no higher than your sorcerer level. When you do so, you absorb the magical energy of the attack. Instead of being affected by the spell, you regain a number of expended spell slots equal to the level of the spell. If you have not used any spell slots for a given level of spell, this feature does not allow you to gain a slot that would exceed your normal maximum. 
For example, if you are a 3rd-level sorcerer and make a 
successful save against a 2nd-level spell, you can regain two 1st-level spell slots or one 2nd-level spell slot. If you don’t have two available 1st-level spell slots, you must regain the 2nd-level slot. If you have one available 1st-level spell slot and no 2nd-level slots, you regain one 1st-level slot when you use this feature.

At 14th level or higher, you can spend 4 sorcery points to infuse yourself with power, showing all the elite power of your bloodline. For 1 minute afterward, you double your proficiency bonus on any Charisma-based checks made against others of your race, and you have advantage on those checks.

Once you use this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can use it again.

If the spell deals damage, you can roll twice for damage and use the higher result. If the spell does not deal damage, the targets of the spell have disadvantage on the saving throw against it.


ELEMENTAL ESSENCE
Y our innate magic arises from elemental power suffused into your being. Y ou might have an elemental creature, such as genie, in your ancestry. Perhaps you lived most of your life near a portal to one of the Elemental Planes, and the ambient magic of the plane saturated everything you ate and drank. Perhaps a magical conjuring went awry, and the essence of an elemental merged with your own. Whatever the ultimate source, you are a walking conduit to an elemental plane.

This damage increases to 2d6 when you reach 7th level.
Y ou can use this feature twice. Y ou regain all expended

INFUSE ELEMENTS
Starting at 6th level, you gain resistance to the damage type associated with your heritage.
Additionally, when you damage a creature with a spell, 
you can spend 1 sorcery point to enhance it with the power of your heritage element.

• Air . The creature is buffeted by strong winds, arcs of 
lighting, and claps of thunder. It can’t take reactions until the start of its next turn.

(whether natural or magical), you create a cyclonic burst of wind. All creatures within 10 feet of you must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 2d6 slashing damage and be blinded by dust and debris until the start of your next turn. 
• Earth. When you appear within 5 feet of nonmagical, unworked stone filling at least one 5-foot square, you create tremors in the earth that ripple outward from you. Each creature within 10 feet of you that is touching the ground must succeed on a Strength saving throw or take 4d6 bludgeoning damage and fall prone.
• Fire. When you appear within 5 feet of a fire at least the size of a campfire, you create a burst of flame around yourself. Each creature within 10 feet must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 2d6 fire damage and catch on fire. Until a creature takes an action to douse the fire, a creature on fire takes 1d6 fire damage at the start of each of its turns.

During this time, you have resistance to piercing and slashing damage, you are immune to poison damage, and you can’t be petrified or poisoned.
• Fire. Y our speed increases by 10 feet. Additionally, during your turn you can spend 1 sorcery point to become fiery and insubstantial.

FARSEER
Y our magic comes from a god of prophecy and prognostication who imbued a sliver of their power in your ancestry. Farseers can trace their power through the generations to a single, powerful ancestor whose divine gift gave them access to the webs of fate. Some are plagued by visions and omens, having no knowledge of their august lineage. These unfortunate individuals might be driven to madness and ostracized because of their uncontrolled, forbidden knowledge. Regardless, the touch of the divine has forever changed you, and the skeins of fate unravel in your view.


BLOOD OF THE SEER
When you choose this origin at 1st level, the blood of your ancestors signals your destiny. Y ou gain proficiency in Insight and History. Y our preternatural sense of what is to come also allows you to sense imminent danger, so you make initiative rolls with advantage.

COMMUNE WITH THE UNKNOWN
When you reach 6th level, your prophetic insight allows you to commune with otherworldly powers. By focusing all your attention on a single yes-or-no question for 1 minute, you can pose that question to the powers beyond. The entity that responds to your question has vast knowledge, but it isn’t omniscient; it can predict only what might happen, not what’s certain to occur. Questions about the future must be phrased in terms of what’s possible or plausible to avoid nonanswers. Y ou must finish a short or long rest before using this feature again.


TIME SLIP
When you reach 14th level, the skeins of time enshroud your body, distorting the fabric of reality around you. As an action, you can expend 3 sorcery points to step out of sync with the current timeline. Y ou can be seen only as an indistinct, shimmery outline. Attacks against you are made with disadvantage, and you have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical weapons. Additionally, you can move through other creatures and solid objects as if they were difficult terrain. If you end your turn inside a solid object, you take 1d10 force damage and are expelled into the nearest open space.
The effect lasts for up to 1 minute, provided you maintain 
concentration on it as on a spell.


SHARING THE DREAM
At 18th level, visions of likely futures constantly weave across your consciousness. Y ou can share that foreknowledge with your companions. As an action, you can grant up to five creatures (which can include yourself) advantage on attack rolls or saving throws—each creature chooses for itself—for up to 1 minute, provided you maintain concentration on this effect as on a spell. Y ou must expend 2 sorcery points per affected creature to trigger this effect.Otherworldl y Patrons
At 1st level, a warlock gains the Otherworldly Patron 
feature. The following options are available to a warlock, in addition to those in the standard rules.


THE GENIE LORD
Y ou have made a pact with a powerful ruler of geniekind on one of the Elemental Planes. The Genie Lord’s concerns encompass a myriad of topics, ranging from those inscrutable to the mortal mind to those that are simple and straightforward. Genie lords compete endlessly against each other, and rivalries between these elemental rulers can engulf entire nations. They aren’t above bribing a rival’s mortal agents to switch sides if they think it will gain them an advantage.


EXPANDED SPELL LIST
The Genie Lord lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.


GENIE LORD EXPANDED SPELLS
SPELL LEVEL SPELLS
1st thunderwave, wind tunnel*
2nd gust of wind, sleet storm

GENIE LORD’S FAVOR
Starting at 1st level, you can speak, read, and write Primordial. Y ou can understand and be understood by any creature that speaks Auran, Ignan, T erran, or Aquan.
Additionally, your patron grants you a token that can 
absorb elemental power. Y ou gain a magical gemstone with the following properties:
• Y ou can use the gem as an arcane focus.
• The gem can capture elemental power. When you take acid, cold, fire, lighting, or thunder damage, you can choose to transfer some or all of the damage into the gem instead of taking the damage yourself. The gem can absorb damage equal to twice your warlock level + twice your Charisma modifier. The gem becomes empty again when you finish a long rest.
• While the gem holds any amount of elemental power, you can use an action to cause it to shed bright light out 

149
CLASS  OPTIONSto 20 feet and dim light for an additional 
20 feet, to shed dim light out to 5 feet, or to douse the light.
If you lose your token, you can perform 
a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous token. Y our token shatters to slivers when you die.


RELEASE ENERGY
Starting at 6th level, you can use the energy stored in your token against foes. When you damage a target with any kind of attack, you can spend stored points to deal extra damage of the same type equal to your Charisma bonus. If you deal damage to multiple targets with a single attack, choose which one takes the extra damage.
Additionally, you can extend the protection of your gem 
to other creatures. When an ally within 30 feet that you can see takes acid, cold, fire, lighting, or thunder damage, you can use your reaction to transfer some of the damage into your gem.


MINOR WISH
Starting at 10th level, you can call upon your Genie Lord to twist fate in your favor. Immediately after you make an attack roll, saving throw, ability check, or damage roll, you can choose to reroll and take the better result.
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you 
finish a short or long rest.
HERALD’S ASPECT
Starting at 14th level, you can channel the power of your patron into your flesh to magically transform into a herald of your Genie Lord. Y our legs fade away into a swirl of elemental energy, and your skin and features take on a cast that resembles that of your patron. Y ou can transform as a bonus action, and the transformation lasts for 1 minute, during which you gain the following benefits:
• Y ou gain a flying speed of 60 feet.
• Y ou have advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
• Choose one of the following damage types: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder. Y ou gain immunity to that damage type.
• Once on your turn when you hit with any attack, you can deal an extra 3d6 damage of one of the following types: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder.
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you 
finish a short or long rest.THE GENIE LORD'S PACT BOONS
The pact boons bestowed by the Genie Lord are modified or augmented as described below. Add these details to whichever pact boon you select.


PACT OF THE BLADE

PACT OF THE CHAIN
When you conjure your familiar or change its form, you can choose the form of a mephit in addition to the usual alternatives. When you use your action to command your mephit familiar to attack, it can use its breath or its Innate Spellcasting if you so desire.


PACT OF THE TOME
Y our book is immune to damage or wear caused by the elements. This includes acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage, as well as simple effects such as being immersed in water or set aflame.

150


CLASS  OPTIONSTHE SIBYL
Y ou have made a pact with the Sibyl, a divine being 
associated with prophecy, knowledge, and fate. Y our patron guides you through visions, portents, and periods of ecstatic clarity to act on its behalf and to further its stratagems. Y our relationship to your patron is different from that of its clergy. Y ou are not asked for faith, worship, or adulation; instead, you serve solely through your actions and influence in the world. Because of that, you might have a strained relationship with the deity’s most dedicated priests and other zealots.


EXPANDED SPELL LIST
The Sibyl lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.


SYBIL EXPANDED SPELLS
SPELL LEVEL SPELLS
1st alarm, seer’s reaction*
2nd augury, blindness /deafness
3rd bestow curse, clairvoyance
4th confusion, divination
5th eidetic memory*, legend lore
* Described in this book


TOUCHED BY THE SYBIL
Starting at 1st level, you are driven to ecstatic gibbering and utterances because of your connection to your patron. Y our prophetic commentary, startling insights, and frenetic appearance are unsettling, distracting, and psychically damaging to your target. Although the manifestation is different, this effect functions the same as the vicious mockery cantrip.
Additionally, you have proficiency in Performance, and 
your proficiency bonus is doubled on ability checks you make using that skill.


DISASTROUS PROGNOSTICATION
Starting at 6th level, you can direct your patron to infiltrate and overwhelm your target’s psyche with knowledge of failures in the target’s immediate future. As an action, designate a creature within 60 feet that can see and hear you. It must make a successful Charisma saving throw or be stunned until the end of your next turn.
After using this feature, you can’t use it again until you 
finish a short or long rest.WHISPERED WARNINGS
When you reach 10th level, the voices in your mind become clearer and more focused. They bolster your mindfulness of your surroundings and grant you a preternatural awareness 
of creatures that mean you harm. While you are wearing light armor or no armor, you can add your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1) to your Armor Class.


PIERCE THE VEIL
Starting at 14th level, when you deal psychic damage to a target, you can also inundate it with frenetic and discordant voices of doom. The awful truths revealed to the target cause it to take an extra 8d10 psychic damage, and it is affected as if by a confusion spell until the end of its next turn.
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you 
finish a long rest.

151


CLASS  OPTIONSTHE SIBYL'S PACT BOONS
The pact boons bestowed by the Sybil are modified or 
augmented as described below. Add these details to whichever pact boon you select.


PACT OF THE BLADE
Y our weapon is usually, but not always, the weapon favored by your patron. When you create or summon your pact weapon, you can choose whether it deals damage of its usual type or psychic damage.


PACT OF THE CHAIN
Y our patron grants you a special familiar, a giant moth 
(Creature Codex, p. 178), to aid you.


PACT OF THE TOME
Y our tome is an illuminated manuscript with depictions of prophets foretelling events to come. As your adventuring career progresses, new illuminations appear in the book’s pages, recording your notable acts in the service of your patron. While this book is on your person, your passive Perception score is increased by 1 when being contested by an enemy's Stealth check.


Arcane Tradition
At 2nd level, a wizard gains the Arcane T radition feature. 
The following options are available to a wizard, in addition to the options in the standard rules.


ELEMENTALIST
Y ou concentrate your arcane studies on the power inherent to one of the Elemental Planes .


WIZARD SPECIALTY
Elementalists believe in the superiority of their chosen element above all others, and they aren’t shy about making that fact known. Elementalists are sometimes secluded researchers, but more often they’re adventurous types who sign on with groups that can appreciate their singular talents.


ELEMENTAL SAVANT
Beginning when you select this specialty at 2nd level, choose one element from the table below. That element becomes the focus of your study. Y ou can speak, read, and write the language associated with your focus element, and the associated damage type is used by other features as noted.ELEMENTAL FOCUS

CLASS  OPTIONSELEMENTAL MASTERY
Starting at 2nd level, you learn techniques called masteries 
to channel elemental magic into your being and your spells.
Masteries. Y ou learn two masteries of your choice, 
which are detailed under “Masteries” below. Y ou learn one additional mastery of your choice at 6th, 10th, and 14th levels. Each time you learn a new mastery, you can also replace one mastery you know with a different one.


SUBSTITUTE ELEMENTS
Beginning at 6th level, you can funnel elemental essence through your damage-dealing spells. When you cast a spell that deals damage, you can change the damage to the type associated with your focus element.


ABSORB ELEMENTS
Starting at 10th level, when you would take damage of the type associated with your focus element, you can use a reaction to take no damage and regain a number of hit points equal to half the damage you would have taken. Y ou can use this feature even if you have resistance or immunity to that damage type from another source. Y ou can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once). Y ou regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.


IRRESISTIBLE STRIKE
At 14th level, your elemental damage spells are unstoppable. Y our spells that deal damage of the type 
associated with your focus element ignore immunity to that 
damage type. Y ou can use this feature a number of times 
equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once). Y ou 
regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.


MASTERIES
Masteries are specialized techniques you can use to augment your spellcasting. Unless noted otherwise, you can use only one mastery on a given spell. The masteries are presented in alphabetical order.


ELEMENTAL ADAPTATION
Prerequisite: 14th level
Y ou add plane shift to your spellbook if you don’t already 
have it, and you can cast it once with this mastery without expending a spell slot. Y ou can travel only to the elemental plane associated with your focus element, or to the Material Plane. While you are on the elemental plane, you aren’t harmed by the normal conditions of the plane, you can breathe normally, and you can use your speed to move in a manner appropriate to the plane (flying for air, burrowing for earth, and swimming for water). Y ou regain the ability to cast plane shift with this mastery when you finish a long rest.ELEMENTAL BINDING
Prerequisite: 10th level
Y ou add planar binding to your spellbook if you don’t 
already have it, and you can cast it once with this mastery without expending a spell slot. When you cast the spell in this way, you must target an elemental creature associated with your focus element. If the elemental fails its saving throw, it gains temporary hit points equal to your wizard level. Y ou regain the ability to cast planar binding with this mastery when you finish a long rest.


ELEMENTAL BULWARK
Prerequisite: 6th level


Y ou gain resistance to the damage type associated with your
focus element, and you have advantage 
on Constitution saving throws made to maintain concentration on spells that involve your focus element.


ELEMENTAL COMMAND
As an action, you can charm an elemental creature for as long as you maintain concentration as if concentrating on a spell, for up to 1 hour. If you or your companions damage the charmed elemental or take any harmful action against it, the charmed condition ends immediately. When this condition ends for a given elemental, it is immune to being charmed by you for 24 hours.


ELEMENTAL EROSION
Prerequisite: 10th level


After you damage a target with a spell that deals the
damage type associated with your focus element, the target gains vulnerability to that damage type until the end of your next turn. Y ou can use this feature twice. Y ou regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.


IGNITE
Prerequisite: Elemental focus (fire)


When you deal fire damage to a target with a spell of
1st level or higher, you can use a bonus action to cause the target to catch fire. At the start of its next turn, the creature takes half as much fire damage as it originally took from the spell, and the flames go out. This damage can be prevented if an ally within 5 feet uses an action to put out the flames. If you damage more than one target with the spell, choose just one to catch fire.


OVERWHELMING ONSLAUGHT
Prerequisite: 14th level
When you damage a creature with a spell of 1st level or 
higher that deals the damage type associated with your focus element, you can weave a lingering aura of elemental energy around the target. At the start of its turn, the creature must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 4d6 damage of the type dealt by the 
153
CLASS  OPTIONSspell and is stunned until the start of its next turn. On a 
successful save, it takes half the damage and the effect ends. 
Y ou can use this feature twice. Y ou regain all expended 
uses when you finish a short or long rest.


STONY REFUGE
Prerequisite: Elemental focus (earth)
When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher, you can use

SWEEPING SWELL
Prerequisite: Elemental focus (water)
When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher, you can use 
a bonus action to create a sweeping wave of water that drenches a target you can see within 20 feet. The creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed 5 feet in the direction of your choice.


WIND BLAST
Prerequisite: Elemental focus (air)
When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher, you can use 
a bonus action to create a line of wind 20 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each creature in the line must make a successful Strength saving throw or take 1d6 slashing damage and be pushed 10 feet away from you in the direction of the line.


WHITE NECROMANCER
An enlightened few wizards know that true mastery of life and death requires understanding of the uneasy balance between life, death, and undeath—the necromantic triad.


WIZARD SPECIALTY
Y ou don’t walk the same path as traditional users of necromantic magic, which your order refers to as “dark necromancers.” Y ou have profound respect for life’s eternal cycle and use the power you have accumulated to honor the dead and aid the living. 
Restriction: Non-Evil. Y ou can choose 
this wizard specialty only if you have an alignment that isn’t evil.


NECROMANCY SAVANT

At 2nd level, you gain proficiency in Medicine and Religion if you don’t already have it, your proficiency bonus is doubled for Wisdom (Medicine) checks, and you have advantage on Intelligence (Religion) checks to recall lore about deities of death, burial practices, and the afterlife. In addition, you learn the spare the dying cantrip, which is a wizard cantrip for you and doesn’t count against the number of wizard cantrips you know.


REBUKE DEATH
Also starting at 2nd level, you can use an action to heal a creature you can touch. The creature regains hit points equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level 

154
CLASS  OPTIONS(minimum of 1). This feature can restore a creature to no 
more than half its hit point maximum. Once a creature has regained hit points from this feature, it can’t do so again until it finishes a long rest.


WHITE NECROMANCY
At 6th level, you add the animate dead spell to your spellbook if it is not there already. When you cast this spell, it has additional effects:
• If the undead creature has an Intelligence score of 5 or lower, its Intelligence becomes 6, and it gains the ability to understand and speak one language of your choice that you speak.
• The undead creature’s alignment is the same as yours.
• At the end of the undead creature’s first 24 hours of serving you, it might continue to serve you for another 24 hours or else return to its eternal rest. Y ou can convince the undead creature to continue serving you with a successful Charisma (Persuasion) check against a DC equal to 8 + the creature’s challenge rating. On a successful check, the creature remains under your control, and the DC of the next check you make to 
maintain control 24 hours later increases by 1. Y ou have disadvantage on this check if you were disrespectful to the creature in the previous 24 hours. On a failed check, or if you choose not to maintain control, the undead creature immediately crumbles to dust.
When you reach 11th level, you add the create undead 
spell to your spellbook. All of the above effects also apply whenever you cast that spell.


LIFE BOND
At 10th level, you add the warding bond spell to your spellbook, and it is a wizard spell for you. Y ou can cast warding bond without expending a spell slot or requiring the material component, and the spell’s duration increases to 4 hours.
Once you cast warding bond in this way, you can’t do so 
again until you finish a long rest. Y ou can still cast warding bond normally using an available spell slot.


PROTECT LIFE
Once you reach 14th level, you can use an action to cause life-preserving magic to emit from you. When you do so, you and friendly creatures within 20 feet of you have resistance to necrotic damage for 1 minute. In addition, each creature affected by your use of Protect Life has advantage on saving throws against spells and effects that reduce its hit point maximum, such as a specter’s Life Drain or the harm spell.
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you 
finish a short or long rest. ARCANE BACKGROUNDS


Many people come of age after being exposed to some
form of arcane magic, or after being attracted to the study of supernatural forces. The arcane backgrounds presented below are examples of how to expand the concept, all designed to give players a wider range of choices when fleshing out their characters if the GM allows this material into the campaign. Optionally, the GM can use these backgrounds to add depth and complexity to NPCs that the player characters will come up against.


ARCHIVIST
Some of your earliest memories are of the library you called home while you learned to read and write under the tutelage of your mentor. The stacks comforted you, protected you, and took you to lands undreamed of. Now the time has come to turn that knowledge into practical experience, and to record your own journey for posterity. 
Skill Proficiencies: Arcana, InvestigationTool Proficiencies: Artisan’s tools (calligrapher’s supplies)Languages: Two of your choiceEquipment: A leather-bound journal full of notes from 
past research projects, a set of robes, calligrapher’s supplies, 5 sheets of loose paper, a pair of spectacles, and a pouch containing 15 gp
FEATURE:


EXPERT RESEARCHER
Y our familiarity with libraries and the tomes contained 
in them is unmatched. If you spend 1 hour studying the available books, grimoires, and codices in an archive, library, or similar collection while researching a specific subject, you can treat any Intelligence-based check result related to that subject of 9 or lower as a 10. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again to research the same subject in the same library.


SUGGESTED CHARACTERISTICS
Arcane archivists are most at home in their libraries. Their personalities and motivations reflect their focus, sometimes obsessive, on recorded knowledge and the search for it. Their motives for pursuing a life as an archivist are rarely so straightforward. 
155
CLASS  OPTIONSD8 PERSONALITY TRAIT
1 There is nothing more important than knowledge. It 
is neither good nor bad. T o suggest otherwise is to be closed in mind and thought.
2 I would rather spend time with my nose in a book. I find interacting with people discomfiting.
3 I am fascinated by a specific area of esoteric knowledge. If I find someone who shares  that interest, we might become fast friends.
4 My mind is my sanctum. I neglect the needs  of my body as secondary, often forgoing  meals and bathing, when I’m lost in  contemplation and study.
5 I am an observer and chronicler of the  journeys, experiences, trials, and tribulations  of my companions as viewed from the  outside looking in.
6 The path to knowledge is not solely traversed  through books and study. T o fully learn, you  must experience!
7 I find the blind faith of religions, cults, and  their ilk perturbing, and I ask endless questions  of those who profess such beliefs.
8 Because I believe that a sound body is essential  for a clear intellect, I relish physical activity  and exercise.
D6 IDEAL
1 Purity. The truth of a matter is subject to the whims of the historian. Facts are pure and incontrovertible. (Any)
2 Focus. Precision and concentration: These are the keys to successful completion of my objectives. (Lawful)
3 Objectivity. Action and inaction have consequences far beyond the immediate future. The appearance of one morality does not preclude the emergence of another as time goes on. (Neutral)
4 Objectification. I use resources—including companions, allies, and bystanders—as I need them to further my ends. (Evil)
5 Preservation. Life is knowledge, and knowledge is life. Preserving life in all its forms is paramount to a civilized culture. (Good)
6 Observation. I will participate only as a last resort. Events, to be true and accurate, must unfold without interference. (Neutral)

CLASS  OPTIONSFEY HOSTAGE
Y ears, possibly centuries, ago you were captured by the 
fey. Each host, as the fey called themselves, treated their “guest” differently. The relationship you forged with your captors defines you just as strongly as the circumstances of your abduction and of your escape or release. Y ou have been indelibly marked—emotionally, psychically, and 
physically—by the fey and their special brand of hospitality.
Skill Proficiencies: Deception, Insight
Tool Proficiencies: One type of gaming set, one type of 
musical instrument

a musical instrument (one of your choice), a set of fine clothes, and a pouch containing 10 gp

D6 FLAW
1 I am protective of all that I have learned. I have sacrificed much for it, and it is mine to do with as I please.
2 I have found the one true way, the path to enlightenment. I share my teachings with all who can hear me, whether they want to follow the path or not.
3 I place my safety ahead of the welfare of all others. How else will my knowledge be recorded and shared with future generations?
4 I was once confined in a prison of my own making. Never again will I limit myself to learning without experiencing.
5 I will not destroy a book, tome, grimoire, or text of any kind. T o lose knowledge is an abomination.
6 I share the knowledge I have worked so hard to attain with all who seek it. A question asked is a question that deserves to be answered.
D8 EVENT
1 My childhood was tithed to the fey by my family in return for prosperity for as long I remained in their care.
2 I made a bargain with a fox to play with its cubs in their den. The fox turned out to be an emissary of the Summer Court, and I was not released until the cubs came of age.
3 Centuries ago my ancestors were rulers and made a political alliance with the fey in exchange for tribute to be paid every third generation. We are no longer rulers, but the fey still demand their tithe.
4 I have no memories of my past before I was taken by the fey.
5 I wandered into an ancient, primeval wood shortly after learning to walk and was found by the fey, who took me in.

gathering resources to return and free them.

2 I will never willingly make another promise to anyone or anything.

CLASS  OPTIONSFEATURE: FIRST IMPRESSIONS


Y ou were raised in a situation in which failing to
adhere to the nuances, niceties, and intrigues of the fey court could have catastrophic repercussions. The first impressions one makes set the tone for future endeavors. Y ou have learned that lesson well, and continue to apply it. In your initial social interaction with an individual fey, you gain a +2 bonus to the first Charisma-based check you make.


SUGGESTED CHARACTERISTICS
A fey hostage will never forget the events that led to their capture, the treatment they experienced, or the circumstances of their release. Their experiences with the unpredictable fey might range from whimsical to pathological.


SOUL CHANNELER
A quirk of fate, or a circumstance of birth, exposed you to the intoxicating power of arcane magic and changed you irrevocably. Y ou spent your formative years learning about yourself, gauging your inner reserves and how much you are willing to sacrifice to achieve your goals.

FEATURE: CHANNEL ESSENCE
Y ou can call upon your inner reserves to recover from debilitating, long-term injuries. As part of a short rest, you can offset a reduction to one of your ability scores by expending a number of Hit Dice equal to twice the amount of the reduction that you want to negate. When used in this manner, the Hit Dice do not confer other benefits, such as additional hit points.


SUGGESTED CHARACTERISTICS
Soul channelers are drawn to the dark arts and the manipulation of available resources to achieve their goals. For some this might include using their own capabilities, but an easier (and more common) method employs summoned creatures, undead servants, and duped allies. Not every soul channeler chooses to exploit such opportunities, but the temptation is there for all.

D8 EVENT
1 My bond was severed and my form irrevocably changed 
in a surge of wild, uncontrolled magic that claimed the life of the mage who called me their familiar.

ALKEMANCY MAGIC
combine their understanding of alchemical reagents and 
elixirs with their knowledge of spellcraft to create new and formidable magical effects.
Even more than this, though, alkemancy embodies a 
unique philosophy of life and nature. Alkemancers don’t concoct useful potions and philters as an end in itself. Ultimately, they seek to expand their minds past mortal limits, or even to achieve true immortality, and alkemancy is simply the path they follow in pursuit of that goal.


T ransmuters and alkemancers belong to similar schools
of thought. But where transmuters have little use for alchemy and its secrets, preferring to rely on brute magical
 
force to achieve their aims—at least, that ’s the opinion held 
by traditional alchemists—alkemancers combine extensive 
knowledge of alchemy with the many ways that the six fundamental essences can be applied to arcane magic.T oo many arcane spellcasters and scholars view alchemy as magic’s poor second cousin—an academic pursuit with practical applications, but still nothing that wizards with real talent would devote serious time or effort to. While alchemy can achieve astounding, even nearly miraculous feats, it’s always been overshadowed by the power and versatility of arcane magic. Because alchemy requires extensive preparation and forethought, adventurers tend to prefer the flexibility and immediacy of spellcasting.
In some areas, a branch of alchemy is practiced that 
surpasses the simple alchemy familiar to the rest of the world. Known as magical chemistry, or simply alkemancy, this discipline delves into the properties of common alchemical substances, such as brimstone and salt, and the means by which they can be used to achieve physical and metaphysical transformation in objects and creatures on levels unseen in most lands. Alkemancy practitioners Alkemancy Magic

162


ALKEMANCY MAGICMagic in  All Things
The power of alkemancy resides within the six 
fundamental essences: brimstone, lead, quicksilver, 
quintessence, salt, and void salt. These essences parallel the 
four standard elements, as well as the two more esoteric elements of metal and void, but are unique to alchemy.
Brimstone. The yellow of brimstone (otherwise known 
as sulfur) represents activity, energy, and masculinity, and it’s related to the sun, volcanoes, 
and elemental 
fire. Brimstone is a destructive essence present in small amounts in explosives, various acids, 
and in substances 
such as alchemist’s fire.
Lead. Also erroneously referred to as antimony (a 
different metal that lead is sometimes combined with), lead represents coldness and heaviness, transformation, and the removal of impurities in objects and creatures. It is associated with broader elemental metals and is often called the oldest or first metal. Lead is reactive and can be toxic in various forms over long periods of exposure—useful qualities in lingering poisons and slow-acting corrosives. It’s used as a component in many alchemical creations and supplies.
Quicksilver. 
Also known as mercury, this silvery metal 
represents passivity, femininity, and malleability. It’s associated with elemental water and the moon. Quicksilver is seen as a creative essence despite its passive nature. It’s also a lethal poison, much faster-acting than lead, for example. A fluid dram of refined quicksilver is occasionally used in vials of both alchemical poisons and antitoxins.
Quintessence. One of the rarest and most mysterious of 
the six fundamental essences, quintessence represents thought, life, and spirit. It is distantly related to elemental air; in its commonest form, it appears as a vaporous, silvery liquid. Quintessence is never used in common alchemical items, largely because it’s one of the most difficult of the essences to obtain and it dissipates as soon as it’s exposed to air. Alkemancers are always keen to find viable substitutes for quintessence in their concoctions.
Salt. The most common of the six fundamental essences 
is salt, which represents matter, physicality, and the human body. It is closely related to elemental earth. Purified salt is used in many common alchemical items, and solutions of salt are used widely in mundane and supernatural formulas and rituals.
Void Salt. Dull black crystals distilled from the blood of 
slain creatures of the Void, the substance known as Void salt takes its name from its granular appearance. Void salt is associated with dissolution, entropy, and madness. It is a dangerous substance to work with, because merely touching it with bare skin deals 1 necrotic damage. Anyone intending to work with Void salt should wear gloves of metal or thick leather, and even those substances corrode soon after coming in contact with Void salt unless they’re protected with an anti-necrotic energy coating. The use of Void salt is reserved for rare alchemical concoctions, mainly acids, poisons, and explosives.

Spell Descriptions
The following spells are presented in alphabetical order.


ACID GATE
7th-level conjuration (alkemancy)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 60 feetComponents: V , S, M (a vial of acid and a polished silver 
mirror worth 125 gp)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Y ou create a portal of swirling, acidic green vapor in an 
unoccupied space you can see. This portal connects with a target destination within 100 miles that you are personally familiar with and have seen with your own eyes, such as your wizard’s tower or an inn you have stayed at. Y ou and up to three creatures of your choice can enter the portal and pass through it, arriving at the target destination (or within 10 feet of it, if it is currently occupied). If the target destination doesn’t exist or is inaccessible, the spell automatically fails and the gate doesn’t form.
Any creature that tries to move through the gate, other 
than those selected by you when the spell was cast,  takes 
10d6 acid damage and is teleported 1d100 × 10 feet in 
a random, horizontal direction. If the creature makes a 
successful Intelligence saving throw, it can’t be teleported by this portal, but it still takes acid 
damage when it enters 
the acid-filled portal and every time it ends its turn in 
contact with it.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell 
slot of 8th level or higher, you can allow one additional 
creature to use the gate for each slot level above 7th.
164


ALKEMANCY MAGICACID RAIN
5th-level conjuration (alkemancy)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 150 feetComponents: V , S, M (a drop of acid)Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Y ou unleash a storm of swirling acid in a cylinder 20 feet 
wide and 30 feet high, centered on a point you can see. The area is heavily obscured by the driving acidfall. A creature that starts its turn in the area or that enters the area for the first time on its turn takes 6d6 acid damage, or half as much damage if it makes a successful Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes half as much damage from the acid (as if it had made a successful saving throw) at the start of its first turn after leaving the affected area.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 
spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 5th.


ALCHEMICAL FORM
6th-level transmutation (alkemancy)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: SelfComponents: V , S, M (a vial of acid, poison, or 
alchemist's fire)
Duration: 1 minute


Y ou transform into an amoebic form composed of highly
acidic and poisonous alchemical jelly. While in this form:
• you are immune to acid and poison damage and to the poisoned and stunned conditions;
• you have resistance to nonmagical fire, piercing, and slashing damage;
• you can’t speak, cast spells, use items or weapons, or manipulate objects;
• your gear melds into your body and reappears when the spell ends;
• you don't need to breathe;
• your speed is 20 feet;
• your size doesn’t change, but you can move through and between obstructions as if you were two size categories smaller; and
• you gain the following action: Melee Weapon Attack: spellcasting ability modifier + proficiency bonus to hit, range 5 ft., one target; Hit : 4d6 acid or poison damage (your 
choice), and the target must make a successful Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the start of your next turn.BLOOD TO ACID
9th-level transmutation (alkemancy)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 60 feetComponents: V , SDuration: Instantaneous
When you cast this spell, you designate a creature within 
range and convert its blood into virulent acid. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 10d12 acid damage and is stunned by the pain for 1d4 rounds. On a successful save, it takes half the damage and isn
’t stunned.
Creatures without blood, such as constructs and plants, 
are not affected by this spell. If blood to acid is cast on a creature composed mainly of blood, such as a blood elemental or a blood zombie (Creature Codex, p. 393), the creature is slain by the spell if its saving throw fails.

165


ALKEMANCY MAGICBOILING OIL
2nd-level conjuration (alkemancy)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 60 feetComponents: V , S, M (a vial of oil)Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Y ou conjure a shallow, 15-foot-radius pool of boiling oil 
centered on a point within range. The pool is difficult terrain, and any creature that enters the pool or starts its turn there must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 3d8 fire damage and falls prone. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and doesn’t fall prone.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 
spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.


BOTTLED ARCANA
5th-level transmutation (alkemancy)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: T ouchComponents: V , S, M (an empty glass container)Duration: See below
By touching an empty, stoppered glass container such as a 
vial or flask, you magically enable it to hold a single spell. T o be captured, the spell must be cast within 1 round of casting bottled arcana and it must be intentionally cast into the container. The container can hold one spell of 3rd level or lower. The spell can be held in the container for as much 
as 24 hours, after which the container reverts to a mundane 
vessel and any magic inside it dissipates harmlessly .
As an action, any creature can unstop the container, 
thereby releasing the spell. If the spell has a range of self, the creature opening the container is affected; otherwise, the creature opening the container designates the target according to the captured spell
’s description. If a creature 
opens the container unwittingly (not knowing that the container holds a spell), the spell targets the creature opening the container or is centered on its space instead (whichever is more appropriate). Dispel magic cast on the container targets bottled arcana, not the spell inside. If bottled 
arcana is dispelled, the container becomes mundane 
and the spell inside dissipates harmlessly.
Until the spell in the container is released, its caster can’t 
regain the spell slot used to cast that spell. Once the spell is released, its caster regains the use of that slot normally.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 
spell slot of 6th level or higher, the level of the spell the container can hold increases by one for every slot level above 5th.BOTTOMLESS STOMACH
1st-level transmutation (alkemancy)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: SelfComponents: VDuration: Concentration, up to 1 hour
When you cast this spell, you gain the ability to 
consume dangerous substances and contain them in an extradimensional reservoir in your stomach. The spell allows you to swallow most liquids, such as acids, alcohol, poison, and even quicksilver, and hold them safely in your stomach. Y ou are unaffected by swallowing the substance, but the spell doesn’t give you resistance or immunity to the substance in general; for example, you could safely drink a bucket of a black dragon’s acidic spittle, but you’d still be burned if you were caught in the dragon’s breath attack or if that bucket of acid were dumped over your head.
The spell allows you to store up to 10 gallons of liquid at 
one time. The liquid doesn’t need to all be of the same type, and different types don’t mix while in your stomach. Any liquid in excess of 10 gallons has its normal effect when you try to swallow it.
At any time before you stop concentrating on the spell, 
you can regurgitate up to 1 gallon of liquid stored in your stomach as a bonus action. The liquid is vomited into an adjacent 5-foot square. A target in that square must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be affected by the liquid. The GM determines the exact effect based on the type of liquid regurgitated, using 1d6 damage of the appropriate type as the baseline.
When you stop concentrating on the spell, its duration 
expires, or it’s dispelled, the extradimensional reservoir and the liquid it contains cease to exist.


BRIMSTONE INFUSION
Transmutation cantrip (alkemancy)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: T ouchComponents: V , S, M (a flask of alchemist's fire and 5 gp 
worth of brimstone)
Duration: 24 hours
Y ou infuse an ordinary flask of alchemist’s fire with 
magical brimstone. While so enchanted, the alchemist’s fire can be thrown 40 feet instead of 20, and it does 2d6 fire damage instead of 1d4. The Dexterity saving throw to extinguish the flames uses your spell save DC instead of DC 10. Infused alchemist’s fire returns to its normal properties after 24 hours.
166


ALKEMANCY MAGICCAUSTIC TORRENT
8th-level conjuration (alkemancy)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: Self (60-foot line)Components: V , S, M (a chip of bone pitted by acid)Duration: Instantaneous


A swirling jet of acid sprays from you in a direction you
choose. The acid fills a line 60 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each creature in the line takes 14d6 acid damage, or half as much damage if it makes a successful Dexterity saving throw. A creature reduced to 0 hit points by this spell is killed, and its body is liquefied. In addition, each creature other than you that’s in the line or within 5 feet of it is poisoned for 1 minute by toxic fumes. Creatures that don’t breathe or that are immune to acid damage aren’t poisoned. A poisoned creature can repeat the Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.


DELAY POTION
2nd-level transmutation (alkemancy)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: T ouchComponents: V , SDuration: 1 hour (see below)
Upon casting this spell, you delay the next potion you 
consume from taking effect for up to 1 hour. Y ou must consume the potion within 1 round of casting delay potion; otherwise the spell has no effect. At any point during delay potion’s duration, you can use a bonus action to cause the potion to go into effect. When the potion is activated, it works as if you had just drunk it. While the potion is delayed, it has no effect at all and you can consume and benefit from other potions normally.
Y ou can delay only one potion at a time. If you try to 
delay the effect of a second potion, the spell fails, the first potion has no effect, and the second potion has its normal effect when you drink it.


GLUEY GLOBULE
3rd-level conjuration (alkemancy)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 120 feetComponents: V , S, M (a drop of glue)Duration: 1 minute or 1 hour


Y ou make a ranged spell attack to hurl a large globule of
sticky, magical glue at a creature within 120 feet. If the attack hits, the target creature is restrained. A restrained creature can break free by using an action to make a successful Strength saving throw. When the creature breaks free, it takes 2d6 slashing damage from the glue 
tearing its skin. If your ranged spell attack roll was a critical 
hit or exceeded the target’s AC by 5 or more, the Strength 
saving throw is made with disadvantage. The target can also 
be freed by an application of universal solvent or by taking 20 acid damage. The glue dissolves when the creature breaks free or at the end of 1 minute.
Alternatively, gluey globule can also be used to glue an 
object to a solid surface or to another object. In this case, the spell works like a single application of sovereign glue and lasts for 1 hour.


LIFE HACK
8th-level necromancy (alkemancy)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 30 feetComponents: V , S, M (a ruby worth 500 gp, which is 
consumed during the casting)
Duration: 1 hour
Choose up to five creatures that you can see within range. 
Each of the creatures gains access to a pool of temporary hit points that it can draw upon over the spell’s duration or until the pool is used up. The pool contains 120 temporary hit points. The number of temporary hit points each individual creature can draw is determined by dividing 120 by the number of creatures with access to the pool. Hit points are drawn as a bonus action by the creature gaining the temporary hit points. Any number can be drawn at once, up to the maximum allowed.
A creature can’t draw temporary hit points from the 
pool while it has temporary hit points from any source, including a previous casting of this spell.


MEPHITIC CROAK
2nd-level conjuration (alkemancy)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: Self (15-foot cone)Components: V , S, M (a dead toad and a dram of arsenic 
worth 10 gp)
Duration: Instantaneous
Y ou release an intensely loud burp of acidic gas in a 15-foot 
cone. Creatures in the area take 2d6 acid damage plus 2d6 thunder damage, or half as much damage with a successful Dexterity saving throw. A creature whose Dexterity saving throw fails must also make a successful Constitution saving throw or be stunned and poisoned until the start of your next turn.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 
spell slot of 3rd level or higher, both acid and thunder damage increase by 1d6 for each slot level above 2nd.
167


ALKEMANCY MAGICQUICKSILVER MANTLE
4th-level transmutation (alkemancy)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: SelfComponents: V , S, M (a nonmagical cloak and a dram of 
quicksilver worth 10 gp)
Duration: 1 hour
Y ou transform an ordinary cloak into a highly reflective, 
silvery garment. This mantle increases your AC by 2 and grants advantage on saving throws against gaze attacks. In addition, whenever you are struck by a ray such as a ray of enfeeblement, scorching ray, or even disintegrate, roll 1d4. On a result of 4, the cloak deflects the ray, which instead strikes a randomly selected target within 10 feet of you. The cloak deflects only the first ray that strikes it each round; rays after the first affect you as normal.


RAY OF ALCHEMICAL NEGATION
4th-level transmutation (alkemancy)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 60 feetComponents: V , SDuration: Instantaneous
Y ou launch a ray of blazing, polychromatic energy from 
your fingertips. Make a ranged spell attack against an alchemical item or a trap that uses alchemy to achieve its ends, such as a trap that sprays acid, releases poisonous gas, or triggers an explosion of alchemist’s fire. A hit destroys the alchemical reagents, rendering them harmless. The attack is made against the most suitable object Armor Class.


This spell can also be used against a creature within range
that is wholly or partially composed of acidic, poisonous, or alchemical components, such as an alchemical golem or an ochre jelly. In that case, a hit deals 6d6 force damage, and the target must make a successful Constitution saving throw or it deals only half as much damage with its acidic, poisonous, or alchemical attacks for 1 minute. A creature whose damage is halved can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.


SALT LASH
3rd-level conjuration (alkemancy)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: SelfComponents: V , S, M (a pinch of salt worth 1 sp, which is 
consumed during the casting)
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
Y ou create a long, thin blade of razor-sharp salt crystals. 
Y ou can wield it as a longsword, using your spellcasting ability to modify your weapon attack rolls. The sword deals 2d8 slashing damage on a hit, and any creature struck by the blade must make a successful Constitution saving throw or be stunned by searing pain until the start of your next turn. Constructs and undead are immune to the blade’s secondary (stun) effect; plants and creatures composed mostly of water, such as water elementals, also take an additional 2d8 necrotic damage if they fail the saving throw.
The spell lasts until you stop concentrating on it, the 
duration expires, or you let go of the blade for any reason.


ALKEMANCER
Wizards who combine traditional spellcasting with advanced alchemical practices and concoctions are called alkemancers. They are a mysterious breed sometimes confused with transmuters, with whom they share a complicated rivalry.


WIZARD SPECIALTY
Unlike many transmuters, who focus on the physical transformation of objects and creatures, alkemancers are concerned with the search for human perfection and immortality, and they use alchemy as a means in this pursuit. Still, there is much crossover between the two specialties. Alkemancers and transmuters can be found working toward the same goals, as both allies and rivals.
Alkemancy spells typically blend conjuration, 
necromancy, and transmutation effects. Few alkemancy spells belong to the schools of evocation or illusion, since
 
spells of these schools summon energy out of nothingness or create things that are not real; both concepts are at odds 
with the precepts of alkemancy, which seeks to reduce energy and matter to its constituent parts and refine them to a more purified (or useful) state of existence.
Except as noted below, alkemancers function as wizards 
and use the wizard spell list.


ALCHEMICAL SAVANT
Beginning when you select this specialty at 2nd level, the gold and time you must spend to copy an alkemancy spell into your spellbook are halved.
When you gain a level, one of the two spells you learn 
for gaining a level can be an alkemancy spell even if you’ve never encountered the spell before. Similarly, when you learn a new cantrip, it can be an alkemancy cantrip even if you’ve never previously encountered it.


SKILLED ALCHEMIST
Beginning at 2nd level, you gain proficiency with alchemical supplies if you did not already have it and your proficiency bonus with alchemical supplies is doubled. Y ou 
168
ALKEMANCY MAGICalso halve the cost of alchemical items you create, enabling 
you to fashion most basic items in a single day. Finally, you gain proficiency with alchemical weapons, and you add your proficiency bonus to their damage rolls when you use them as weapons.


ESSENCE MASTERY
Beginning at 6th level, you can add one of the six fundamental essences to your spells as an additional material component at the cost of 1 gp per spell level. This addition doesn't increase the casting time of the spell or any of its other effects, except as follows.
• Adding brimstone to a spell that deals fire damage gives the flames a bluish hue and releases irritating vapors. A creature damaged by the spell must make a successful Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for a number of rounds equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1).
• Adding lead to a spell that improves your Armor Class, such as mage armor or shield, increases the spell’s AC bonus by 2. If the spell has a duration longer than 1 round, the duration increases by a number of rounds equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1). Any visible spell effect modified with the addition of lead takes on a dull gray sheen.
• Adding quicksilver to a spell that changes the form of a creature or an object, such as alter self or polymorph, increases the spell’s duration by a number of minutes equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1 minute). For any such spell that has a duration of less than 10 minutes, such as alchemical form, the increase is measured in rounds instead of minutes. Any change in form modified with quicksilver is accompanied by lustrous wisps or motes of silvery energy.
• Adding quintessence to a necromancy spell that grants temporary hit points, such as false life or life hack, increases the temporary hit points gained by a number equal to twice your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 2). Adding quintessence to a spell doesn’t change the spell’s visible aspects.
• Adding salt to a spell that deals acid damage gives the acid a pale, crystalline hue and causes it to become extremely painful. Any creature damaged by the spell must also make a successful Constitution saving throw or lose 1d4 points from its Strength and Dexterity scores (rolled separately). These lost ability score points 

169


ALKEMANCY MAGICreturn automatically after a number of rounds equal to
your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1).
• Adding void salt to a spell that deals necrotic damage causes the spell to shed palpable strands of darkness. Any creature damaged by the spell is also surrounded by a veil of cloying shadows and must make a successful Constitution saving throw or be restrained for a number of rounds equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1).


CRAFT MINOR ELIXIR
Beginning at 10th level, you automatically learn the formulas for a number of elixirs, oils, philters, or potions of your choice equal to 1 + your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one). Y ou do not need to spend time or gold researching these formulas.
When you brew an elixir, oil, philter, or potion based 
on one of the formulas you obtained, you can add exotic alchemical reagents to the mixture at the cost of additional gold equal to half the potion's standard cost. If you do so, the resulting mixture is more powerful than normal: if the potion’s effect is instantaneous (such as a potion of healing), it automatically has its maximum effect; if the potion has a duration (such as a potion of giant strength), it lasts for twice its normal duration.


PATH OF THE GOLDEN GLOWER
Beginning at 14th level, you learn the secret formulas for brewing the fabled Six Elixirs, magical draughts of incredible potency and rarity. Each elixir takes a full year or more to create from exceedingly rare ingredients, but once finished and consumed or otherwise applied, it grants its user a permanent bonus of some sort. The six elixirs are described in the next section.
Additionally, once you reach 14th level, you become so 
adept at working with dangerous chemicals and reagents that you gain resistance to acid damage and poison damage and immunity to the poisoned condition.


THE SIX ELIXIRS
Alkemancers are responsible for the creation of many astonishing alchemical items, but the pinnacle of their craftsmanship is known collectively as the Six Elixirs, magical liquids of such incredible power and rarity that they feature in many tales and legends. Vast resources and even many lives have been expended in the pursuit of these fabled elixirs. A single elixir could be the focus of an entire campaign arc for an alkemancer character or group of adventurers
.


Brewing any one of the Six Elixirs takes one year of
work with rare, mysterious, and sometimes dangerous ingredients. The ingredients needed to create each elixir are given in its description. The GM can modify ingredients to meet the needs of the campaign.


BLACK ELIXIR
Potion, legendary


This greasy black liquid acts as a poison when drunk or
rubbed on flesh. Its unfortunate or foolish user takes 12d6 poison damage, or half as much damage with a successful DC 20 Constitution saving throw. 
Its true power is revealed, however, when black elixir is 
smeared on a doorway or other portal; the magical oil acts as a forbiddance spell with a duration of one year. Unlike 
the spell, black elixir doesn’ t incorporate a password and 
only affects celestials and fiends. Typically, the creator of 
the elixir determines when the elixir is created whether the forbiddance effect deals radiant or necrotic damage.
Ingredients. The heart of a marut, the powdered horn of 
a ki-rin, and a vial of black mud taken from the bottom of a 
lake that at least one celestial or fiend has bathed in.


GOLDEN ELIXIR
Potion, legendary
The most famous of the six elixirs is this thick, golden, 
syrupy liquid that grants its imbiber eternal life. The potion completely stops the aging process and renders the imbiber immune to all natural and magical diseases and 
poisons. The drinker can still be harmed or killed through other methods such as violence, but the march of time no longer holds any threat over him or her.
Ingredients. A thimble of distilled sunlight, the breath of 
a solar, and the hair of a venerable sage who is at least 100 years old.


IRON ELIXIR
Potion, legendary
This dark, grainy liquid tastes positively awful. Anyone 
imbibing the elixir gains permanent resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage and gains a damage threshold of 5, but their speed is reduced by 10 feet and they always make Dexterity saving throws and Dexterity ability checks with disadvantage that can’t be overcome or canceled out by any means.
Ingredients. The core of an iron golem, a shard of purest 
adamantine, and the powdered teeth of a mountain giant.


JADE ELIXIR
Potion, legendary
This bright green, effervescent elixir grants its consumer 
incredible Charisma when dealing with celestials, elementals, fey, and fiends. The drinker always has advantage on Charisma checks when dealing with extraplanar creatures, and when one of the selected 
170
ALKEMANCY MAGICcreatures is called or conjured, it arrives with maximum 
hit points.
Ingredients. The tears of an invisible stalker, the claw of a 
pit fiend, and the tongue of a bard of at least 10th level.


PEARL ELIXIR
Potion, legendary


This silvery-white elixir has a variety of effects depending
on whether it is drunk, rubbed on a creature's feet, or smeared on the hull of a boat. If drunk, the elixir confers the ability to breathe both air and water with equal ease. If rubbed on the feet, the elixir provides a creature with the ability to walk on water as if wearing a ring of water walking. If placed on the hull of a boat or similar vessel, the vessel gains a damage threshold of 20 against all environmental effects, and anyone piloting the vessel has advantage on ability checks associated with it. All of these effects are permanent.
Ingredients. The scale of a merfolk princess, a vial of pure 
elemental water, and the eye of a kraken.


RUBY ELIXIR
Potion, legendary


This vermilion-hued elixir neutralizes all magical and
nonmagical diseases and poisons, all curses of 8th level or lower, and all exhaustion effects, as well as restoring hit points as a superior healing potion. If this elixir is poured over a corpse that has been dead for no more than a year, it restores the creature to life (as the resurrection spell) even if the corpse could normally not be resurrected.
Ingredients. A mixture of purest cinnabar, the blood of 
a slain dragon of at least adult age, and the hearts of six celestial tigers willingly donated to the alkemancer.


ALKEMANCY MAGIC ITEMS
Alkemancers have devised countless magic items over the centuries. Their creations range from fairly standard items such as the bubbling retort and scalehide cream to uniquely alkemantic items such as Anuraag's crucible.


ALEMBIC OF UNMAKING
Wondrous item, very rare
This large alembic is a glass retort supported by a bronze tripod and connected to a smaller glass container by a bronze spout. The bronze fittings are etched with arcane symbols, and the glass parts of the alembic sometimes emit bright, amethyst sparks.


If a magic item is placed inside the alembic and a fire lit
beneath it, the magic item dissolves and its magical energy drains into the smaller container. Artifacts, legendary magic items, and any magic item that won’t physically fit into the alembic (anything larger than a shortsword or a cloak) can’t be dissolved in this way. Full dissolution and distillation of an item’s magical energy takes 1 hour, but 10 minutes is enough time to render most items nonmagical.
If an item spends a full hour dissolving in the alembic, 
its magical energy coalesces in the smaller container as a lump of material resembling gray-purple, stiff dough known as arcanoplasm. This material is safe to handle and easy to incorporate into new magic items. Using arcanoplasm while creating a magic item reduces the cost of the new item by 10 percent per degree of rarity of the magic item that was distilled into the arcanoplasm.


An alembic of unmaking can distill or disenchant one item
per 24 hours.
ANURAAG’S CRUCIBLE


Artifact
Thousands of years ago, a powerful alkemancer named Anuraag constructed an enormous crucible in his quest to create the perfect organism. He hoped it would bring forth an immortal being that could surpass the limitations imposed by human flesh and surpass even the gods. Anuraag used the crucible to create so many monstrosities that eventually the local deities had to take action against him. The alkemancer was destroyed for his impertinence, and his crucible was sealed away at the bottom of a mighty chasm.


Anuraag's crucible is an enormous object fashioned from
white clay and engraved with mystical symbols chased with burnished copper and electrum. The crucible is large enough to hold a single Huge creature, two Large creatures, four Medium creatures, or eight Small ones.


If one or more creatures are placed in the crucible and
the crucible is heated over an intense, magical flame, each 

171
ALKEMANCY MAGICcreature must make a DC 20 Constitution saving throw 
against the crucible’s powerful transmutation magic. If this saving throw fails, the creature’s body liquefies and the creature is blinded, deafened, and paralyzed until the transformation is complete. The creature’s equipment doesn’t dissolve; as a result, most creatures are stripped naked before being placed in the crucible. Over the course of 10 minutes, the liquefied creature transforms into another creature.
If this transformation is interrupted, the transforming 
creature is slain. It can be brought back to life in its original form by a resurrection spell or comparable magic.
If the process reaches completion, the creature 
transforms into another creature as if affected by a shapechange spell. The transformed creature must make a successful DC 20 Wisdom saving throw or lose its memory and all its previous abilities, traits, and features, which are replaced by the blank mind of a newly born version of the creature it transformed into. Whether or not a creature retains its mental faculties, the newly assumed form is permanent. At that point, the creature can regain its former form (and memories and abilities) only through a wish spell or comparable magic.
Constructs and undead are immune to the crucible’s 
power, as is any creature that can change its shape at will, such as a doppelganger.
T o determine what a creature transforms into, roll a d20.

Destroying the Crucible. Anuraag's crucible can be 
destroyed if a celestial and a fiend, both of at least challenge 
rating 15, willingly allow themselves to be transformed at 
the same time. If this happens, the crucible can’t take the burden of transforming both creatures and shatters in a spectacular explosion that deals 20d6 piercing damage to all creatures in a 60-foot radius, or half as much damage with a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw
.BRAIN JUICE
Potion, very rare
This foul-smelling, murky, purple-gray liquid is created from the liquefied brains of spellcasting creatures such as 
aboleths. Anyone consuming this repulsive mixture must make a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw. On a successful save, the drinker is infused with magical power and regains 1d6 + 4 expended spell slots. On a failed save, the drinker is afflicted with a form of short-term madness lasting for 1 day. If a creature consumes multiple doses of brain juice and fails three consecutive Intelligence saving throws, it gains a form of long-term madness permanently and automatically fails all further saving throws brought about 
by drinking brain juice.


BUBBLING RETORT
Wondrous item, uncommon
This long, thin retort is fashioned from smoky yellow glass 
and is topped with an intricately carved brass stopper.


Y ou can unstopper the retort and fill it with liquid as an
action. Once you do so, it spews out multicolored bubbles 
in a 20-foot radius. The bubbles last for 1d4 + 1 rounds. While they last, creatures within the radius are blinded and the area is heavily obscured to all creatures except those with tremorsense. The liquid in the retort is destroyed in the process with no harmful effect on its surroundings. If any bubbles are popped, they burst with a wet smacking 
sound but no other effect.


GIRDLE OF TRAVELING ALCHEMY
Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)


This wide leather girdle has many sewn-in pouches and
holsters that hold an assortment of empty beakers and vials. Once you have attuned to the girdle, these containers magically fill with the following liquids:
• 2 flasks of alchemist ’s fire
• 2 flasks of alchemist ’s ice
• 2 vials of acid
• 2 jars of swarm repellent
• 1 vial of assassin’ s blood poison
• 1 potion of climbing
• 1 potion of healing
Each container magically replenishes each day at dawn, if you are wearing the girdle. All the potions and alchemical substances produced by the girdle lose their properties if 
they’re transferred to another container before being used.


OIL OF DEFOLIATION
Wondrous item, uncommon
Sometimes known as weedkiller oil, this greasy brown fluid 
contains the crushed husks of dozens of locusts. One vial 
of the oily substance can coat one weapon or up to five 
172


ALKEMANCY MAGIC
pieces of ammunition. Applying the oil takes 1 minute. 
Once applied, the coated weapon or ammunition deals an additional 1d6 necrotic damage to plants or plant creatures on every successful hit for the next hour
.
The oil can also be applied directly to a willing, helpless, 
or immobile plant or plant creature. In this case, the substance deals 4d6 necrotic damage, which is enough to kill most ordinary plant life smaller than a large tree.
POTION, PILL FORM


Rarity varies by potion type
Alkemancers have mastered the craft of condensing 
potions into pills. Potions in pill form have the same effect as regular potions and have the same color as the potions they’re derived from, but an individual pill has effectively no weight and can be concealed very easily in a boot, pouch, hatband, or secret pocket. A pill can be swallowed as a bonus action. A potion in pill form costs five times as much as the regular version of the potion.


SCALEHIDE CREAM
Wondrous item, rare
As an action, you can rub this dull green cream over  your 
skin. When you do, you sprout thick, olive -green scales 
like those of a giant lizard or green dragon that last for 
1 hour. These scales give you a natural AC of 15 + your Constitution modifier. This natural AC doesn’t combine with any worn armor or with a Dexterity bonus to AC.
A jar of scalehide cream contains 1d6 + 1 doses.


MUNDANE ALKEMICAL ITEMS
In addition to the many spells and magic items alkemancers have created, they are also responsible 
for 
scores of nonmagical items that are tremendously useful. A 
few of these are described here .
ALCHEMIST’S ICE
This blue-white flask is cool to the touch because it contains a volatile liquid that turns to ice when exposed to air. If the flask is poured over a surface, it creates a 5-foot patch of ice that functions as regular ice for movement purposes. The flask can be thrown at a creature like a flask of alchemist
’s 
fire; if it hits, it deals 1d8 cold damage and the creature must make a successful DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or its speed becomes 0 until the start of your next turn.
Alchemist’s ice was invented by alkemancers in the 
tropics as a way of keeping their food and drinks cold, and many restaurants and taverns still use it for this purpose. A vial of alchemist’s ice costs 50 gp.HYPODERMIC ARROW
The head of this arrow is fitted with a syringe that can be filled with liquid. When it strikes a creature, the arrow deals 1d4 piercing damage plus the effect of whatever liquid the syringe injects into the creature. Poisons are commonly employed, as are acid, drugs, and various eclectic potions.
A hypodermic arrow is extremely fragile; it always 
breaks on impact, whether it hits the target or not. One hypodermic arrow costs 25 gp. They’re always sold empty, but those found in treasure hoards or among monsters’ gear might be already filled. Filling the syringe takes an action, but it can be done hours or days before the arrow is used.


SWARM REPELLENT
This slimy yellow paste can be smeared over exposed parts of the body to protect against attacks by insect swarms. A swarm of ants, beetles, biting flies, wasps, or similar insects that enters your space while you’re protected by swarm repellent must make a successful DC 10 Constitution saving throw or be unable to attack you. A repelled swarm can repeat this saving throw at the start of its next turn; most swarms prefer to seek out an unprotected target.
A jar of swarm repellent costs 40 gp and holds enough 
paste to protect two Medium or four Small creatures. Applying the repellent takes 1 minute, so it’s not a good option in the middle of combat, but it’s effective for 1 hour or until you’re immersed in water.


TOOTH CAPSULE
A tooth capsule is a false tooth, or a cap that fits over a tooth, that contains a dose of a potion in pill form. (The pill loaded into a tooth capsule can’t be changed.) T o activate the tooth capsule, you simply bite down on it as a bonus action and make a DC 10 Strength check. On a successful check, the capsule shatters and releases the pill, which you can then swallow, hold in your mouth, or spit out.
Determining whether a tooth in someone else’s mouth 
is a tooth capsule takes a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom (Medicine) check. Obviously, the creature must be restrained, unconscious, paralyzed, or cooperative in order for the tooth to be examined.


T ooth capsules containing poison are often used by spies
and operatives of fanatical organizations who are willing to die rather than allow their secrets to be captured by their enemies. 
T ooth capsules are usually priced at 100 gp plus the cost 
of whatever potion they’re loaded with. The use of poison or other harmful potions in a tooth capsule is illegal in some places, and the black market price for one in such a place might be much higher.

ANGELIC MAGIC
The heavenly planes shine with light and power, as deities 
both benevolent and stern look down from their thrones. Without question, the most powerful of those gods’ servants are the angels. Angels carry the word of their creators to mortal ears and bring down their righteous blades against creatures of darkness. These entities are mighty beyond mortal ken, and their very names seethe with the essence of creation. The secrets of harnessing the power of the angels are hidden within those names, and a select few mortals have learned how to realize that potential.


The first angelic seals and wards were passed to worthy
mortals as rewards for their sacrifice and valor in the service of light, and as weapons to be used in the struggle against the fiendish hordes. An angelic seal is the written form of the true name of an angel, inscribed on an object or a surface in a particular way to draw on the essence of that angel’s power. That power flows through the written


Angelic Magic
VARIANT RULE: VIRTUOUS CASTERS


Angelic spells are principally intended to be used by
good‑aligned spellcasters, though nothing prevents non‑good casters from learning them. As an optional rule, 
the DM can declare that a non ‑good caster of angelic 
spells can gradually become more inclined toward a good alignment, provided that the caster uses such magic 
frequently for non ‑evil purposes.


The alignment of a spellcaster who satisfies that condition
while advancing through two levels of experience moves from evil to neutral or from neutral to good (at the player's option, for a player character). After gaining an additional four levels, a caster who started out evil can move from neutral to good.


Angelic magic has no effect on the lawful or chaotic
component of a caster's alignment.
174
ANGELIC MAGICKnowledge of angelic spells is rare, and it’s not possible 
for a spellcaster to develop or learn these esoteric spells 
without being trained in these specialized practices. Occasionally, the powers of light make a gift of a particular spell to a favored champion. Also, tomes containing the notes and experiments of the first angelic scribes still exist in hidden libraries and forgotten shrines.


A spellcaster fortunate enough to discover an angelic
spell in written form can gain access to it through study. The usual method of gaining this access is through the pursuit of the angelic scribe wizard specialty. Angelic scribes preserve the knowledge embodied in the angels’ names and pass those secrets to their apprentices so the forces of good will always be able to wield their mightiest weapons in times of need.representation and into the individual who carries it, or into a location that bears a ward. The angel isn’t harmed or hindered when a fraction of its power is siphoned this way, but it does notice, and woe befalls any wicked soul who steals the secret of a seal and misuses its power.


ANGELIC SPELLS
Seals and wards aren’t the only expressions of angelic power available to mortals. In the ages since the first angelic names were carved into earthly forms, the battles between light and darkness have tested the limits of the heavenly host. In the wake of these struggles, mortal practitioners experimented with variations on the seals and found ways to isolate the power of the angels and shape it into spells.

ANGELIC MAGICSpell Descriptions
The following spells are presented in alphabetical order.


ANGELIC GUARDIAN
1st-level conjuration (angelic)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 30 feetComponents: V , SDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute


Y ou conjure a minor celestial manifestation to protect a
creature you can see within range. A faintly glowing image resembling a human head and shoulders hovers within 5 feet of the target for the duration. The manifestation moves to interpose itself between the target and any incoming attacks, granting the target a +2 bonus to AC.
Also, the first time the target gets a failure on a Dexterity 
saving throw while the spell is active, it can use its reaction to reroll the save. The spell then ends.


BENEDICTION
Abjuration cantrip (angelic)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 60 feetComponents: V , SDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute


Y ou call down a blessing in the name of an angel of
protection. A creature you can see within range shimmers with a faint white light. The next time the creature takes damage, it rolls a d4 and reduces the damage by the result. The spell then ends.


BLADE OF WRATH
3rd-level evocation (angelic)
Casting Time: 1 bonus actionRange: SelfComponents: V , S, M (a rebuke of evil, written in 
Celestial)
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
Y ou create a sword of pure white fire in your free hand. 
The blade is similar in size and shape to a longsword, and it lasts for the duration. The blade disappears if you let go of it, but you can call it forth again as a bonus action.


Y ou can use your action to make a melee spell attack
with the blade. On a hit, the target takes 2d8 fire damage and 2d8 radiant damage. An aberration, fey, fiend, or undead creature damaged by the blade must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be frightened until the start of your next turn.The blade sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim 
light for an additional 20 feet.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell 
slot of 4th level or higher, either the fire damage or the radiant damage (your choice) increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd.


BLAZING CHARIOT
5th-level conjuration (angelic)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 30 feetComponents: 
V , S, M (a small golden wheel worth 250 gp)
Duration: 1 hour
Calling upon the might of the angels, you conjure a 
flaming chariot made of gold and mithral in an unoccupied 
10-foot -square space you can see within range. Two horses 
made of fire and light pull the chariot. Y ou and up to three other Medium or smaller creatures you designate can board the chariot (at the cost of 5 feet of movement) and are unharmed by the flames. Any other creature that touches the chariot or hits it (or a creature riding in it) with a melee attack while within 5 feet of the chariot takes 3d6 fire damage and 3d6 radiant damage. The chariot has AC 18 and 50 hit points, is immune to fire, poison, psychic, and radiant damage, and has resistance to all other nonmagical damage. The horses are not separate creatures but are part of the chariot. The chariot vanishes if it is reduced to 0 hit 
points, and any creature riding it falls out. The chariot has a speed of 50 feet and a flying speed of 40 feet.
On your turn, you can guide the chariot in place of your 
own movement. Y ou can use a bonus action to direct it to take the Dash, Disengage, or Dodge action. As an action, you can use the chariot to overrun creatures in its path. On this turn, the chariot can enter a hostile creature’s space. The creature takes damage as if it had touched the chariot, is shunted to the nearest unoccupied space that it can occupy, and must make a successful Strength saving throw or fall prone in that space.


BLESSED HALO
2nd-level evocation (angelic)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: SelfComponents: V , SDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute


A nimbus of golden light surrounds your head for the
duration. The halo sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet.
This spell grants you a pool of 10 points of healing. When 
you cast the spell and as an action on subsequent turns during the spell’s duration, you can expend points from 
176


ANGELIC MAGICthis pool to restore an equal number of hit points to one
creature within 20 feet that you can see.
Additionally, you have advantage on Charisma checks 
made against good creatures within 20 feet.


If any of the light created by this spell overlaps an area of
magical darkness created by a spell of 2nd level or lower, the spell that created the darkness is dispelled.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell 
slot of 3rd level or higher, the spell’s pool of healing points increases by 5 for each spell slot above 2nd, and the spell dispels magical darkness created by a spell of a level equal to the slot used to cast this spell.


CELESTIAL FANFARE
6th-level evocation (angelic)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 100 feetComponents: V , S, M (miniature trumpet worth 100 gp)Duration: Instantaneous


A great blaring of trumpets from on high blasts down
upon an area you designate. All evil creatures in a 30-foot radius take 4d6 thunder damage and 4d6 radiant damage and are blinded and deafened for 2d4 rounds. A successful Constitution saving throw reduces the damage and the duration of the blinded and deafened conditions by half.


Neutral or unaligned creatures within the area take
half as much damage and are blinded and deafened for 1d4 rounds. A successful save reduces the damage to 
one -quarter and negates the blinding and deafening effects. 
Good-aligned creatures are not harmed by this spell.
DEVA’S WINGS
4th-level transmutation (angelic)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: T ouchComponents: V , S, M (a wing feather from any bird)Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
Y ou touch a willing creature. The target grows feathery 
wings of pure white that grant it a flying speed of 60 feet and the ability to hover. When the target takes the Attack action, it can use a bonus action to make a melee weapon attack with the wings, with a reach of 10 feet. If the wing attack hits, the target takes bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 + your spellcasting ability modifier and must make a successful Strength saving throw or fall prone. When the spell ends, the wings disappear, and the target falls if it  was aloft.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell 
slot of 5th level or higher, you can target one additional target for each slot level above 4th.GREATER SEAL OF SANCTUARY
9th-level abjuration (ritual) (angelic)
Casting Time: 1 minuteRange: T ouchComponents: V , S, M (incense and special inks worth 
500 gp, which the spell consumes)
Duration: 24 hours
Y ou inscribe an angelic seal on the ground, the floor, 
or other solid surface of a structure. The seal creates a spherical sanctuary with a radius of 100 feet, centered on the seal. For the duration, aberrations, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead that approach to within 5 feet of the boundary know they are about to come into contact with a deadly barrier. If such a creature moves so as to touch the boundary, or tries to cross the boundary by any means, including teleportation and extradimensional travel, it must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 15d8 radiant damage, is repelled to 5 feet outside the boundary, and can’t target anything inside the boundary with attacks, spells, or abilities until the spell ends. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much radiant damage and can cross the boundary. If the creature is a fiend that isn’t on its home plane, it is immediately destroyed (no saving throw) instead of taking damage. 
Aberrations, elementals, fey, and undead that are 
within 100 feet of the seal (inside the boundary) have disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws, and each such creature takes 4d8 radiant damage at the start of its turn.
Creatures other than aberrations, elementals, fey, 
fiends, and undead can’t be charmed or frightened while within 100 feet of the seal.

177
ANGELIC MAGICThe seal has AC 18, 75 hit points, resistance to 
bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, and 
immunity to psychic and poison damage. Ranged attacks against the seal are made with disadvantage. If it is scribed on the surface of an object that is later destroyed (such as a wooden door), the seal is not damaged and remains in place, perhaps suspended in midair. The spell ends only if the seal itself is reduced to 0 hit points.


QUINTESSENCE
8th-level transmutation (angelic)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: Self (120-foot radius)Components: V , SDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
By calling upon an archangel, you become infused with 
celestial essence and take on angelic features such as golden skin, glowing eyes, and ethereal wings. For the duration of the spell, your Armor Class can’t be lower than 20, you can’t be frightened, and you are immune to necrotic damage.
In addition, each hostile creature that starts its turn 
within 120 feet of you or enters that area for the first time on a turn must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. A creature frightened in this way is restrained. A frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature’s saving throw is successful or if the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the frightening effect of the spell until you cast quintessence again.


SEAL OF SANCTUARY
7th-level abjuration (ritual) (angelic)
Casting Time: 1 minuteRange: T ouchComponents: V , S, M (incense and special inks worth 
250 gp, which the spell consumes)
Duration: 24 hours
Y ou inscribe an angelic seal on the ground, the floor, 
or other solid surface of a structure. The seal creates a spherical sanctuary with a radius of 50 feet, centered on the seal. For the duration, aberrations, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead that approach to within 5 feet of the boundary know they are about to come into contact with a deadly barrier. If such a creature moves so as to touch the boundary, or tries to cross the boundary by any means, including teleportation and extradimensional travel, it must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 10d8 radiant damage, is repelled to 5 feet outside the boundary, and can’t target anything inside the boundary with attacks, spells, or abilities until the spell ends. On a 
successful save, the creature takes half as much radiant damage and can cross the boundary. If the creature is a fiend that isn’t on its home plane, it is immediately destroyed (no saving throw) instead of taking damage. 
Aberrations, elementals, fey, and undead that are 
within 50 feet of the seal (inside the boundary) have disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws, and each such creature takes 2d8 radiant damage at the start of its turn.
Creatures other than aberrations, elementals, fey, 
fiends, and undead can’t be charmed or frightened while within 50 feet of the seal.
The seal has AC 18, 50 hit points, resistance to 
bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, and immunity to psychic and poison damage. Ranged attacks against the seal are made with disadvantage. If it is scribed on the surface of an object that is later destroyed (such as a wooden door), the seal is not damaged and remains in place, perhaps suspended in midair. The spell ends only if 
the seal is reduced to 0 hit points.


ANGELIC SCRIBE
An angelic scribe studies the angelic seals that harness the 
power of celestial messengers through their names and shapes that power into magical effects. Beyond the seals and wardings themselves, you learn esoteric spells to call 
down the essence of the angelic host.


WIZARD OR CLERIC SPECIALTY
Most angelic scribes take up their craft out of reverence 
and a desire to protect the righteous; a few tempt angelic wrath with their lust for power that’s otherwise beyond their grasp.
How to Start: If you’re a wizard who wants to become 
an angelic scribe, you make that decision upon reaching 2nd level, when you are also entitled to choose an arcane tradition. If you decide to follow the path of the angelic scribe exclusively, you can forego the selection of an arcane tradition and gain the features of the angelic scribe specialty instead.
 Y ou can also pursue the angelic scribe specialty in 
conjunction with one of the standard arcane traditions. If you choose to do this, you gain the Savant feature of your chosen school in addition to Angelic Savant (described below). Also at 2nd level, you choose whether to gain Seal Scribe (see below) or the 2nd-level feature of your chosen school. Thereafter, at 6th, 10th, and 14th level, you choose between the lowest-level features still available. For instance, a conjurer might select Seal Scribe at 2nd level and Minor Conjuration at 6th level, followed by either 
Warding Seal or Benign T ransposition at 10th level.
178
ANGELIC MAGICFor a cleric, the process is much the same except that it 
involves making choices between angelic scribe features 
and the features provided by your domain. These decisions occur at 2nd, 6th, 8th, and 17th level instead of at the levels indicated for wizards.
Paladins, although they can cast angelic spells and gain 
angelic feats, cannot become angelic scribes.


ANGELIC SAVANT
Beginning when you take up this specialty at 2nd level, the gold and time you must spend to copy an angelic spell into your spellbook is halved.


SEAL SCRIBE
Also at 2nd level, you learn the Celestial language if you don’t already know it, and you gain the ability to scribe angelic seals.
Seals. Y ou learn two angelic seals of your choice, which 
are detailed below under “Angelic Seals.” Y ou can spend 10 minutes scribing an angelic seal you know on paper, canvas, stone tiles, or some other surface or object that can be carried or displayed. Alternatively, you can spend 8 hours using appropriate artisan tools to carve or etch a more permanent seal into harder material. Once you have scribed a seal, you can activate it as an action.
• Y ou can have one seal active at a time. The number of active seals you can maintain increases by one at 6th level (two seals), 10th level (three seals), and 14th level (four seals). 
• A seal’s magic is suppressed while you are concentrating on maintaining a spell or a similar effect. A suppressed seal still counts against the number of active seals you can maintain. 
• As a bonus action, you can deactivate a seal prior to activating another one. A broken or defaced seal deactivates immediately and must be replaced.
• Y ou can give an active seal to another creature, enabling it to gain the benefit of the seal while it holds or openly wears the seal, except when it is concentrating on maintaining a spell or a similar effect.
• Y ou learn one additional angelic seal of your choice at 6th, 10th, and 14th levels. Each time you learn a new seal, you can also replace one seal you know with a different one.


WARDING SEAL
Beginning at 6th level, you can place warding seals to protect areas. This follows the procedure for scribing an angelic seal, but a warding seal must be fashioned on the ground, the floor, or a similarly suitable portion of a structure such as a wall, column, or ceiling. As an action, you can touch the seal to activate it. Y ou must maintain concentration on the effect as if concentrating on a spell.
Once activated, a warding seal creates a spherical 
“safe space” that extends out to 30 feet around it, large enough to surround a small building or series of rooms of appropriate dimensions (a 22-foot cube, for example, or any space of approximately 11,000 cubic feet). An aberration, fey, fiend, or undead cannot physically cross the boundary, cast spells through it, or project its abilities across the boundary unless it makes a successful Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC. A creature that fails the saving throw can try again on its next turn. A creature that makes a sucessful save and moves across the boundary into the protected area isn’t affected by the boundary while it remains inside (the boundary impedes only incoming entities and effects, not outgoing ones), but it must contend with the ward again if it leaves the area and tries to reenter.


GREATER SEAL
Starting at 10th level (or 8th level for a cleric), you can use an action to empower one of your active angelic seals or warding seals to greater effect. If you choose an angelic seal, its user typically gains the greater benefit of the seal for 1 minute (unless otherwise noted), replacing the normal benefit during that time. If you choose a warding seal, for the next hour a creature that fails its saving throw against the ward takes 6d6 radiant damage and automatically fails additional saves against the ward during this time.
Y ou can use this ability twice, and you regain expended 
uses when you finish a short or long rest.


ANGELIC WRATH
At 14th level (or 17th level for a cleric), you add conjure celestial to your spellbook or your spells known if you don’t already know it.
Additionally, you can use a bonus action to infuse 
your seals with angelic wrath. For 1 minute, you deal an additional 1d8 radiant damage with weapon attacks—and so does anyone within 30 feet of you that is in possession of one of your active seals.
Y ou can’t use this ability again until you finish a short or 
long rest.


ANGELIC SEALS
Each angelic seal consists of the name of an angel, written in Celestial on a suitable surface, that resonates with a given seal’s effect. 
Amnayeth (Benevolence). This seal allows the user to 
reroll a failed ability check to improve another creature’s attitude. Greater: As an action once during the next 
179
ANGELIC MAGICminute, the user can cause a creature that can hear the 
user to make a successful Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or be charmed for 10 minutes.
This seal can’t be used again on a check involving the 
same creature until the user finishes a short or long rest.
Simil (Clarity). The user adds half your Intelligence 
modifier (minimum of 1) to its Wisdom (Insight) and Wisdom (Perception) checks for 1 minute. Greater: The user gains blindsight out to a range of 10 feet.
Rikbil (Fortitude). When it is hit with an attack, the user 
can use its reaction to add 2 to its AC against that attack. It must be able to see the attacker to use this effect. Greater: The user gains resistance to nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.
Barrateth (Fortune). The user can add 1 to an attack roll, 
saving throw, or ability check. The addition is made after rolling the die but before the GM reveals whether it was a success or failure. Greater: After making an attack roll, saving throw, or ability check, the user can roll another d20 and choose which result to use. The second roll is made after the initial roll but before the GM reveals whether that roll was a success or failure.
This seal can’t be used again until the user finishes a 
short or long rest.
Vrechiel (Glory). When the user reduces an enemy to 0 
hit points, the user gains temporary hit points equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1). Greater: At the start of its turn once during the next minute, the user gains temporary hit points equal to your caster level.
Ophanim (Humility). The user adds half your 
Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1) to its Dexterity (Stealth) checks. It keeps this benefit until the start of its next turn when it takes a hostile action (any action that could inflict intentional damage on a creature). Greater: If it hasn’t taken a hostile action this turn, the user can use its action to present an aura of humility. A creature that wants to attack the user must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or choose another target. If there are no other targets it can attack, the creature spends its action doing nothing.
Chamule (Judgment). When the user 
hits a creature with an opportunity attack, the user can move up to half its speed, provided it ends the move no farther away from the creature it hit. Greater: As a 
reaction when it is hit with an attack once during the next minute, the user can cause the attacker to take radiant damage equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1) if the attacker is within 60 feet of the user.
Jelaal (Recovery). The user automatically succeeds on 
its first death saving throw and then regains 1 hit point. Greater: When the user regains hit points, it regains an additional number of hit points equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1). Once it is used, this seal doesn’t function again until the user finishes a short or long rest. 
Iaothe (Temperance). When it makes a Wisdom saving 
throw, the user can use its reaction to add your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1) to the roll. The bonus is added after the die is rolled but before the GM reveals whether the saving throw succeeds or fails. Greater: The user can’t be charmed or frightened. 
Once it is used, this seal doesn’t function again until the 
user finishes a short or long rest. 
Xapanie (Wrath). 
Once on the user’s turn when it 
hits with a weapon attack, the attack gains a +1 bonus to damage. Greater: The user’s attacks are magical, and once on the user’s turn during the next minute when it hits with a weapon attack, the attack deals additional radiant damage equal to half your caster level (minimum of 1).

CHAOS MAGIC
There exists a form of raw arcane power with no rules or 
structure—only an unthinking addiction to changing the reality with which it comes into contact. This force is known as chaos magic. Those who learn to channel this energy eventually expand and aid this magic in its chaos; to master it, though, chaos demands an emotional price of extreme highs and lows. An eccentric lifestyle or even full-on madness is common among chaos magic specialists, who are collectively known as chaos mages.CHAOS MAGIC SPELL LISTS

Spell Descriptions
The following spells are presented in alphabetical order.


BABBLE
5th-level enchantment (chaos)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 60 feetComponents: V , SDuration: Concentration, up to 1 hour


This spell causes the speech of affected creatures to sound
like nonsense. Each creature in a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw when you cast this spell or be affected by it.


An affected creature cannot communicate in any spoken
language that it knows. When it speaks, the words come out as gibberish. Spells with verbal components cannot be cast. The spell does not affect telepathic communication, nonverbal communication, or sounds emitted by any creature that does not have a spoken language. As an action, a creature under the effect of this spell can attempt another Intelligence saving throw against the effect. On a successful save, the spell ends.


BAD TIMING
2nd-level divination (chaos)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 60 feetComponents: VDuration: Instantaneous


Y ou point toward a creature that you can see and twist
strands of chaotic energy around its fate. If the target gets a failure on a Charisma saving throw, the next attack roll or ability check the creature attempts within 10 minutes is made with disadvantage.


CALM OF THE STORM
3rd-level abjuration (chaos)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: T ouchComponents: V , S, M (an amethyst worth 250 gp, which 
the spell consumes)
Duration: Instantaneous
While visualizing the world as you wish it was, you lay 
your hands upon a creature other than yourself and undo the effect of a chaos magic surge that affected the creature within the last minute. Reality reshapes itself as if the surge never happened, but only for that creature.
At Higher Levels.


When you cast this spell using a spell
slot of 4th level or higher, the time since the chaos magic 
surge can be 1 minute longer for each slot level above 3rd .


CHAOTIC FORM
4th-level transmutation (chaos)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: T ouchComponents: V , SDuration: 10 minutes


Y ou cause the form of a willing creature to become
malleable, dripping and flowing according to the target’s will as if the creature were a vaguely humanoid-shaped ooze. The creature is not affected by difficult terrain, it has 
advantage on Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks made to escape 
a grapple, and it suffers no penalties when squeezing through spaces one size smaller than itself. The target’s movement is halved while it is affected by chaotic form.
183
CHAOS MAGICAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 
spell slot of 5th level or higher, the duration increases by 10 minutes for each slot level above 4th.


CHAOTIC VITALITY
2nd-level conjuration (chaos)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: T ouchComponents: V , SDuration: Instantaneous


Make a melee spell attack against a creature that has a
number of Hit Dice no greater than your level and has at least 1 hit point. On a hit, you conjure pulsating waves of chaotic energy within the creature and yourself. After a brief moment that seems to last forever, your hit point total changes, as does the creature’s. Roll a d100 and increase or decrease the number rolled by any number up to your spellcasting level, then find the result on the Hit Point Flux table. Apply that result both to yourself and the target creature. Any hit points gained beyond a creature’s normal maximum are temporary hit points that last for 1 round per caster level.
For example, a 3rd-level spellcaster who currently has 
17 of her maximum 30 hit points casts chaotic vitality on a creature with 54 hit points and rolls a 75 on the Hit Point Flux table. The two creatures have a combined total of 71 hit points. A result of 75 indicates that both creatures get 50 percent of the total, so the spellcaster and the target end up with 35 hit points each. In the spellcaster’s case, 5 of those hit points are temporary and will last for 3 rounds.
At Higher Levels.


When you cast this spell using a
spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the maximum Hit Dice 
of the affected creature increases by 2 for each slot level above 2nd.


HIT POINT FLUX
SIZE HP
01–09 0
10–39 1
40–69 25 percent of total
70–84 50 percent of total
85–94 75 percent of total
95–99 100 percent of total
100 200 percent of total, and both creatures gain the effect of a haste  spell that lasts for 1 round per 
caster levelCHAOTIC WORLD
6th-level illusion (chaos)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 60 feetComponents: V , M (seven irregular pieces of colored 
cloth that you throw into the air)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute


Y ou throw a handful of colored cloth into the air while
screaming a litany of disjointed phrases. A moment later, a 30-foot cube centered on a point within range fills with multicolored light, cacophonous sound, overpowering 
scents, and other confusing sensory information. The effect is 
dizzying and overwhelming. Each enemy within 
the cube must make a successful Intelligence saving throw or become blinded and deafened, and fall prone. An affected enemy cannot stand up or recover from the blindness
 or 
deafness while within the area, but all three conditions end immediately for a creature that leaves the spell’s area.


ELEMENTAL TWIST
2nd-level evocation (chaos)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: SelfComponents: V , S, M (a thin piece of copper twisted 
around itself)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
During this spell’s duration, reality shifts around you 
whenever you cast a spell that deals acid, cold, fire, lightning, poison, or thunder damage. Assign each damage type a number and roll a d6 to determine the type of damage this casting of the spell deals. In addition, the spell’s damage increases by 1d6. All other properties or effects of the spell are unchanged.


ENTROPIC DAMAGE FIELD
3rd-level transmutation (chaos)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 60 feetComponents: V , S, M (a silver wire)Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
By twisting a length of silver wire around your finger, you 
tie your fate to those around you. When you take damage, that damage is divided equally between you and all creatures in range who get a failure on a Charisma saving throw. Any leftover damage that can’t be divided equally is taken by you. Creatures that approach to within 60 feet of you after the spell was cast are also affected. A creature is allowed a new saving throw against this spell each time you take damage, and a successful save ends the spell’s effect on that creature. 
184


CHAOS MAGICFLUCTUATING ALIGNMENT
4th-level enchantment (chaos)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 120 feetComponents: V , SDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
Y ou channel the force of chaos to taint your target’s mind. 
A target that gets a failure on a Wisdom saving throw must roll 1d20 and consult the Alignment Fluctuation table to find its new alignment, and it must roll again after every minute of the spell’s duration. The target’s alignment stops fluctuating and returns to normal when the spell ends. These changes do not make the affected creature friendly or hostile toward the caster, but they can cause creatures to behave in unpredictable ways.


ALIGNMENT FLUCTUATION
D20 ALIGNMENT
1–2 Chaotic good
3–4 Chaotic neutral
5–7 Chaotic evil
8–9 Neutral evil
10–11 Lawful evil
12–14 Lawful good
15–16 Lawful neutral
17–18 Neutral good
19–20 Neutral


FRENZIED BOLT
2nd-level evocation (chaos)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 120 feetComponents: V , SDuration: Instantaneous


Y ou direct a bolt of rainbow colors toward a creature
of your choice within range. If the bolt hits, the target takes 3d8 damage, of a type determined by rolling on the Random Damage Type table. If your attack roll (not the adjusted result) was odd, the bolt leaps to a new target of 
your choice within range that has not already been targeted 
by frenzied bolt, requiring a new spell attack roll to hit. The bolt continues leaping to new targets until you roll an even number on your spell attack roll, miss a target, or run out of potential targets. Y ou and your allies are legal targets for this spell, if you are particularly lucky—or unlucky
.RANDOM DAMAGE TYPE
D10 DAMAGE TYPE
1 Acid
2 Cold
3 Fire

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell 
slot of 3rd level or higher, you create an additional bolt for each slot level above 2nd. Each potential target can be hit only once by each casting of the spell, not once per bolt.


ILL-FATED WORD
1st-level divination (chaos)
Casting Time: 1 reaction, which you take when an 
enemy makes an attack roll, ability check, or saving 
throw
Range: 30 feet
Components: VDuration: Instantaneous
Y ou call out a distracting epithet to a creature, worsening 
its chance to succeed at whatever it’s doing. Roll a d4 and subtract the number rolled from an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw that the target has just made; the target uses the lowered result to determine the outcome of its roll.


MASS SURGE DAMPENER
5th-level abjuration (ritual; chaos)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 30 feetComponents: V , SDuration: 1 minute, or until expended
Using your strength of will, you protect up to three 
creatures other than yourself from the effect of a chaos magic surge. A protected creature can make a DC 13 Charisma saving throw to negate the effect of a chaos magic surge that does not normally allow a saving throw, or it gains advantage on a saving throw that is normally allowed. Once a protected creature makes a successful saving throw allowed by mass surge dampener, the spell’s effect ends for that creature.
185


CHAOS MAGICMISFORTUNE
6th-level necromancy (chaos)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 60 feetComponents: V , S, M (a broken mirror)Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Y ou cast a pall of bad luck over all creatures in a 15-foot 
radius centered on a point within range. Each creature in that area must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be cursed with bad luck for the duration of the spell. A creature under the effect of this spell has disadvantage on all ability checks, saving throws, and attack rolls. A remove curse spell ends this effect.
Special. If a targeted creature is carrying a stone of good 
luck, the creature is unaffected by the spell, but the item ceases to function for 24 hours. Likewise, if a targeted creature is carrying a luck blade, the creature is unaffected by the spell, but the sword’s Luck ability and saving throw bonuses cease to function for 24 hours.


MIST OF WONDERS
2nd-level conjuration (chaos)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: Self (30-foot radius)Components: V , SDuration: 1 minute
A colorful mist surrounds you out to a radius of 30 feet. 
Creatures inside the mist see odd shapes in it and hear random sounds that don’t make sense. The very concepts of order and logic don’t seem to exist inside the mist.
Any 1st-level spell that’s cast in the mist by another caster 
or that travels through the mist is affected by its strange nature. The caster must make a Constitution saving throw when casting the spell. On a failed save, the spell transforms into another 1st-level spell the caster knows (chosen by the GM from those available), even if that spell is not currently prepared. The altered spell’s slot level or its original target or targeted area can’t be changed. Cantrips are unaffected. If (in the GM’s judgment) none of the caster’s spells known of that level can be transformed, the spell being cast simply fails.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 
spell slot of 3rd level or higher, it affects any spell cast using a spell slot of any lower level. For instance, using a 6th-level slot enables you to transform a spell of 5th level or lower into another spell of the same level.PARAGON OF CHAOS
8th-level transmutation (chaos)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: SelfComponents: VDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute


Y ou become a humanoid-shaped swirling mass of color
and sound. Y ou gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. Y ou are also immune to the following conditions: exhaustion, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned, and unconscious. Finally, you gain truesight to 30 feet and can teleport 30 feet as a move.
Each round, as a bonus action, you can cause an 
automatic chaos magic surge, choosing either yourself or another creature you can see within 60 feet as the caster for the purpose of resolving the effect. Y ou must choose the target before rolling percentile dice to determine the nature of the surge. The DC of any required saving throw is calculated as if you were the caster.


ROAMING PAIN
1st-level necromancy (chaos)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 30 feetComponents: V , SDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute


Y ou afflict a single humanoid within range with severe
pain in a random part of its body. Roll a d6 and consult the table to determine the spell’s initial effect.
D6 BODY PART EFFECT
1 Head Incapacitated
2 Throat Unable to speak coherently or cast spells with verbal components
3 Chest Cannot take reactions or bonus actions
4 Abdomen Disadvantage on Constitution saving throws
5 Arm Disadvantage on attack rolls, Strength and Dexterity skill checks
6 Leg Movement halved
The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On 
a successful save, it is able to function despite the pain and ignore the effects. At the start of the target’s turn each round for the duration of the spell, roll again on the table to see where the pain affects the target in that round. 
186


CHAOS MAGICROARING WINDS OF LIMBO
8th-level conjuration (chaos)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 150 feetComponents: V , SDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Y ou tear open a breach to the planes of chaos, and the 
act of doing so fills an area with a dangerous windstorm. The area consists of twelve 10-foot cubes, which you can arrange as you wish. Each cube must have at least one face in common with a face of another cube. Each creature in the area is deafened, and any sound it makes cannot be heard outside the area. The wind disperses all gases and vapors and extinguishes all unprotected flames in the area, and has a 75 percent chance of extinguishing protected flames, such as lanterns. All Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight made by a creature in the area have disadvantage due to the dust, grit, and debris being cast about.


Each creature in the area must make a Strength saving
throw at the start of its turn. On a failed save, the creature is pushed 15 feet in a random direction. (Roll a d8, designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on around the points of the compass.) The wind also hampers movement; a creature in the area must spend 2 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves.
As a bonus action on each of your turns, you can bombard 
up to twelve creatures in the area with flying debris, dealing 
2d10 bludgeoning, 2d10 piercing, and 2d10 slashing damage. A creature that makes a successful Dexterity saving throw takes half the damage.


SHIFTING THE ODDS
2nd-level divination (chaos)
Casting Time: 1 bonus actionRange: SelfComponents: VDuration: Instantaneous
By wrapping yourself in strands of chaotic energy, you 
gain advantage on the next attack roll or ability check that you make. Fate is a cruel mistress, however, and her scales must always be balanced. The second attack roll or ability check (whichever occurs first) that you make after casting shifting the odds is made with disadvantage.SURGE DAMPENER
3rd-level abjuration (ritual; chaos)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: T ouchComponents: V , SDuration: 1 minute, until expended
Using your strength of will, you cause one creature 
other than yourself that you touch to become so firmly entrenched within reality that it is protected from the effects of a chaos magic surge. The protected creature can make a DC 13 Charisma saving throw to negate the effect of a chaos magic surge that does not normally allow a saving throw, or it gains advantage on a saving throw that is normally allowed. Once the protected creature makes a successful saving throw allowed by surge dampener, the spell ends.


TIMELY DISTRACTION
2nd-level evocation (chaos)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 25 feetComponents: V , S, M (a handful of sand or dirt thrown 
in the air)
Duration: 3 rounds
Y ou call forth a swirling, crackling wave of constantly 
shifting pops, flashes, and swept-up debris. This chaos can confound one creature. If the target gets a failure on a Wisdom saving throw, roll a d4 and consult the following table to determine the result. An affected creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Otherwise, the spell ends when its duration expires.

CHAOS MAGICUNCONTROLLABLE TRANSFORMATION
D10 MUTATION
1 A spindly third arm sprouts from your shoulder. As a bonus action, you can use it to attack with a light weapon. Y ou 
have advantage on Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) checks and any checks that require the manipulation of tools.
2 Y our skin is covered by rough scales that increase your AC by 1 and give you resistance to a random damage type (roll on the Damage Type table in the frenzied bolt spell description).
3 A puckered orifice grows on your back. Y ou can forcefully expel air from it, granting you a flying speed of 30 feet. Y ou must land at the end of your turn. In addition, as a bonus action, you can try to push a creature away with a blast of air. The target is pushed 5 feet away from you if it fails a Strength saving throw with a DC equal to 10 + your Constitution modifier.
4 A second face appears on the back of your head. Y ou gain darkvision out to a range of 120 feet and advantage on 
sight -based and scent-based Wisdom (Perception) checks. Y ou become adept at carrying on conversations with 
yourself.
5 Y ou grow gills that not only allow you to breathe underwater but also filter poison out of the air. Y ou gain immunity to inhaled poisons.
6 Y our hindquarters elongate, and you grow a second set of legs. Y our base walking speed increases by 10 feet, and your carrying capacity becomes your Strength score multiplied by 20.
7 Y ou become incorporeal and can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. Y ou take 1d10 force damage if you end your turn inside an object. Y ou can’t pick up or interact with physical objects that you weren’t carrying when you became incorporeal.
8 Y our limbs elongate and flatten into prehensile paddles. Y ou gain a swimming speed equal to your base walking speed and have advantage on Strength (Athletics) checks made to climb or swim. In addition, your unarmed strikes deal 1d6 bludgeoning damage.
9 Y our head fills with a light gas and swells to four times its normal size, causing your hair to fall out. Y ou have advantage on Intelligence and Wisdom ability checks and can levitate up to 5 feet above the ground.
10
Y ou grow three sets of feathered wings that give you a flying speed equal to your walking speed and the ability to hover.UNCONTROLLABLE TRANSFORMATION
7th-level transmutation (ritual; chaos)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: SelfComponents: V , S, M (the bill of a platypus)Duration: 1 hour


Y ou infuse your body with raw chaos and will it to
adopt a helpful mutation. Roll a d10 and consult the Uncontrollable T ransformation table below to determine what mutation occurs. Y ou can try to control the shifting of your body to gain a mutation you prefer, but doing so is taxing; you can roll a d10 twice and choose the result you prefer, but you gain one level of exhaustion. At the end of the spell, your body returns to its normal form.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 
spell slot of 8th level or higher, you gain an additional mutation for each slot level above 7th. Y ou gain one level of exhaustion for each mutation you try to control.

188


CHAOS MAGICUNDERMINE ARMOR
1st-level transmutation (chaos)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 30 feetComponents: V , SDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute


Y ou unravel the bonds of reality that hold a suit of armor
together. A target wearing armor must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or its armor softens to the consistency of candle wax, decreasing the target’s AC by 2.
Undermine armor has no effect on creatures that aren’t 
wearing armor.


UNRULY ITEM
1st-level transmutation (chaos)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 30 feetComponents: V , SDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute


Y ou animate an object in the possession of a creature
within range, giving the object limited movement and a compulsion to thwart its possessor. The effect of the spell varies depending on the kind of object you affect.
Weapon: A weapon being wielded 
by a creature fights and twists, trying to free itself from the creature’s grasp. The creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature has disadvantage on any attacks it makes in that round with the weapon. On a save that fails by 5 or more, the creature drops the weapon.
Armor: The creature’s armor shifts 
and moves, becoming noisy and uncomfortable. If the armor does not normally impart disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks, it does so while this spell is in effect. The creature wearing it must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take a 10-foot penalty to its speed and be unable to use the Dash action.Other Items: The effects on other carried items can 
vary at the GM’s discretion. A potion might behave as a weapon, trying not to be drunk, falling to the ground and becoming ruined if the Dexterity save is failed by 5 or more. A backpack might try to empty itself, disgorging a random item each round on a failed save.


UNSHACKLED MAGIC
9th-level enchantment (chaos)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 120 feetComponents: V , SDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute


Y ou designate a creature within range that has the
Spellcasting or Innate Spellcasting special trait and imbue it with wild magic, causing it to lose control of its magical ability. If the target gets a failure on a Charisma saving

CHAOS MAGIC
throw, then on its next turn, it rolls randomly to select one 
of its available spells. The target then spontaneously casts 
that spell as an action. If the spell can be cast using a spell slot higher than its level, roll randomly to determine 
what 
slot is used to cast the spell. The target still determines 
factors such as the location of the spell’s area or which creatures it affects, as normal, but it is compelled to cast that particular spell at that particular time.
Each round while this spell remains in effect, the target 
makes another Charisma saving throw. On a successful save, it can act normally in that round, but the unshackled magic spell does not end.


WILD SHIELD
4th-level abjuration (chaos)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: SelfComponents: V , SDuration: 1 minute
Y ou surround yourself with the forces of chaos. Wild lights 
and strange sounds engulf you, making stealth impossible. While wild shield is active, you can use a reaction to repel a spell of 4th level or lower that targets you or whose area you are within. A repelled spell has no effect on you, but doing this causes the chance of a chaos magic surge as if you had cast a spell, with you considered the caster for any effect of the surge.


Wild shield ends when the duration expires or
when it absorbs 4 levels of spells. If you try to repel a spell whose level exceeds the number of levels remaining, make an ability check using your spellcasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the spell’s level – the number of levels wild shield can still repel. If the check succeeds, the spell is repelled; if the check fails, the spell has its full effect. The chance of a chaos magic surge exists regardless of whether the spell is repelled.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can repel one additional spell level for each slot level above 4th.WILD TRAJECTORY 
7th-level transmutation (chaos)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 100 feetComponents: V , SDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Y ou create a 30-foot cube of magical instability that 
causes spell effects passing through it to diverge wildly from their original paths. When a spell with a visible or tangible manifestation (such as fireball, lightning bolt, or a ray or projectile such as magic missile or ray of frost) passes through the area, roll a d8. On a 1, the spell continues on its original path or toward its original target; on a 2, it diverts 45 degrees to the right; on a 3, it diverts 90 degrees to the right; on a 4, it diverts 135 degrees to the right; on a 5, it turns 180 degrees, back the way it came (striking the caster if it is a targeted spell); on a 6, the spell diverts 45 degrees to the left; on a 7 , it diverts 90 degrees to the left; on an 8, it diverts 135 degrees to the left.
A spell that affects anything in its path, such as lightning 
bolt, continues to do so along its new trajectory, up to the limit of its range. A fireball spell will travel in the new direction up to the limit of its range before detonating. A targeted spell will strike the first viable target it encounters along its new trajectory.

CHAOS MAGICENTROPIST
Wizards who specialize in chaos magic crave an 
understanding of probability and life’s unpredictable outcomes to the point of obsession.


WIZARD SPECIALTY
What starts as an attempt to analyze the patterns of chaos quickly becomes a trip down the rabbit hole to madness.
How to Start: If you ’re a wizard who wants to become an 
entropist, you make that decision upon reaching 2nd level, when you are also entitled to choose an arcane tradition. If you decide to follow the path of the entropist exclusively, you can forego the selection of an arcane tradition and gain the features of the entropist specialty instead.


Y ou can also pursue the entropist specialty in
conjunction with one of the standard arcane traditions. If you choose to do this, you gain the Savant feature of your chosen school in addition to Chaos Magic Savant (described below). Also at 2nd level, you choose whether to gain Long Odds (see below) or the 2nd-level feature of your chosen school. Thereafter, at 6th, 10th, and 14th level, you choose between the lowest-level features still available. For instance, a transmuter might select Minor Alchemy at 2nd level and Long Odds at 6th level, followed by either T ransmuter
’s Stone or Twisted 
Arcana at 10th level.


CHAOS MAGIC SAVANT
Beginning when you take up this specialty at 2nd level, the gold and time you must spend to copy a chaos spell into your spellbook is halved.


LONG ODDS
Also starting at 2nd level, you can manipulate the reality-changing forces of chaos to alter the odds in a situation. Y ou can use a bonus action to give yourself, or a reaction to give a creature you can see, advantage on one attack roll, saving throw, or ability check made during this turn. Using this feature causes a chaos magic surge. Y ou must finish a long rest before you can use this feature again.


TWISTED ARCANA
Starting at 6th level, when you cast a spell that deals damage, you can infuse the effect with greater power by channeling chaos through yourself. Y ou make this choice after determining that the spell has been successfully cast (by making a spell attack roll) but before rolling damage. If you decide to use this feature, roll a d6 + 1; this is the maximum number of your spell’s damage dice you can reroll. 

191


CHAOS MAGICY ou can reroll any number of damage dice up to that
maximum, and you must use the rerolled results.
In addition, the type of damage your spell deals is 
replaced randomly. Use the Random Damage Type table to determine the spell’s new damage type.


RANDOM DAMAGE TYPE
D10 DAMAGE TYPE
1 Acid
2 Cold
3 Fire
4 Force
5 Lightning
6 Necrotic
7 Poison
8 Psychic
9 Radiant
10 ThunderUsing this feature has a chance of causing a chaos magic 
surge. Y ou must finish a long rest before you can use this feature again.


SHIFTING RESISTANCE
Beginning at 10th level, when you cast a chaos spell, you gain resistance to a random damage type for a number of rounds equal to 1 + your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1). Y ou can try to narrow the spell’s focus to a damage type you prefer, but doing so has an element of risk; you can roll twice on the Random Damage Type table and choose the result you prefer, but you must also roll to see if a chaos magic surge occurs. Y ou must finish a long rest before you can use this feature again.


MASTER OF CHAOS
Starting at 14th level, anytime you cause a chaos magic surge, you regain one use of Long Odds, Twisted Arcana, or Shifting Resistance without needing to finish a long rest. In addition, every time you cast a chaos spell, you gain temporary hit 
points equal to your Intelligence modifier + 
the spell’s level.

192


CHAOS MAGICCOLLEGE OF ENTROPY
Bards of the College of Entropy are itinerant gamblers 
and daring thrill-seekers whose actions are supremely unpredictable.


BARD COLLEGE
Rather than relying on ancient lore or skill with arms, these bards throw themselves into new challenges just to see what happens, trusting in luck to see them through. They’re sometimes called luck stealers (with a mixture of derision and respect), because no matter how bad things get for everyone around them, these bards always seem to come out unscathed.


BONUS PROFICIENCIES
When you join the College of Entropy at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in Acrobatics and Athletics and proficiency with a gaming set of your choice.


LUCK STEALER
Also at 3rd level, you learn to borrow a little bit of other people’s luck for yourself. When a creature that you can see within 60 feet is about to make an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw with advantage, you can use a reaction and expend one of your uses of Bardic Inspiration. If you do so, that creature takes a penalty to its die roll equal to the number you roll on your Bardic Inspiration die. 
After the creature’s attack roll, ability check, or saving 
throw is resolved, you gain the benefit of that Bardic Inspiration die, which is usable only on yourself and lasts only for a number of rounds equal to the roll of the Bardic Inspiration die. If you do not use the benefit before that time, it is lost.
For example, if you roll a 5 on your Bardic Inspiration 
die, the creature takes a -5 penalty to its roll. Y ou can then apply a +5 bonus to one attack roll, ability check, or saving throw that you make within the next 5 rounds.
Stealing luck, regardless of whether you use 
the Bardic Inspiration benefit, causes a chance of a chaos magic surge.


INFUSION OF FORTUNE
At 6th level, whenever you cast a chaos spell, you have a chance of causing a chaos magic surge, and you regain one use of your Bardic Inspiration. Y ou regain the use of this feature after you finish a short or long rest.


BELIEF IS A TOOL
Everything desires to be something else. Starting at 14th level, as an action, you can exchange one bard spell you know for another bard spell of the same level or a lower one. At the end of your next turn, your list of known spells returns to normal. Using this ability has a chance of causing a chaos magic surge.
193


CHAOS MAGICCHAOS MAGIC SURGE

33–34 Until you finish a long rest, every word you utter sounds normal to you but is heard by others as incomprehensible babbling. This effect doesn’ t impair your ability to cast spells.
35–36 Three creatures within 30 feet that you can see are targeted by a bolt of light that does 1d8 radiant damage. Each target can avoid the damage with a successful Constitution saving throw.
37–38 Every creature within 60 feet of you, except you, teleports 10 feet in a random direction. If the destination is a solid object or hazardous terrain, the creature doesn't move.

47–48 For 30 feet around you, the ground turns into broken, uneven, difficult terrain.
49–50 For 1 hour, you gain a bonus to weapon damage equal to your spellcasting ability modifier.


CHAOS MAGIC SURGES
The use of chaos magic sometimes causes a chaos magic 
surge. This phenomenon is similar to the wild magic surge caused by some sorcerers. When a chaos magic surge has a chance of occurring, the caster rolls a d20. On a 1, roll percentile dice and consult the Chaos Magic Surge table to determine the result.

DRAGON MAGIC
Some scholars believe that true magic springs only from 
deep inside an individual creature, such as a dragon or a demon, and those possessing bloodlines from such terrible creatures can tap their personal magical stores. Others speculate that magic comes only from other planes of existence or from the gods themselves.
The truth is that magic comes from several sources, and 
powerful beings can utilize any wellspring of magic to craft spells and fuel seemingly miraculous effects. One of the first creatures to master all types of magic were the majestic and terrible dragons. Although they were capable of controlling the elements and inducing terrible fear, they also mastered more subtle magic. They wove a tapestry of magic into their homes, giving their lairs innate defenses. They taught their servants, from humans to kobolds to elves, how to make use of the magic that permeated the atmosphere. And they also passed on to their kin—both true dragons and lesser creatures—the kind of magic that roiled in blood and bone.
Dragon magic is a distinct branch of arcane study, 
founded in the Draconic language and in an elemental understanding of arcane forces.

DRAGON MAGICSpell Descriptions
The following spells are presented in alphabetical order.


ASPECT OF THE DRAGON
7th-level transmutation (dragon)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: SelfComponents: V , S, M (a dragon scale)Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
This spell draws out the ancient nature within your blood, 
allowing you to assume the form of any dragon-type creature of challenge 10 or less.
Y ou assume the hit points and Hit Dice of the new form. 
When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. If you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren’t knocked unconscious.
Y ou retain the benefits of any features from your class, 
race, or other source and can use them, provided that your new form is physically capable of doing so. Y ou can speak only if the dragon can normally speak.
When you transform, you choose whether your 
equipment falls to the ground, merges into the new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions normally, but equipment doesn’t change shape or size to match the new form. Any equipment that the new form can’t wear must either fall to the ground or merge into the new form. The GM has final say on whether the new form can wear or use a particular piece of equipment. Equipment that merges 
has no effect in that state.


CATCH THE BREATH
3rd-level transmutation (dragon)
Casting Time: 1 reaction, which you take when you 
make a saving throw against a breath weapon attack
Range: SelfComponents: VDuration: Instantaneous
Y ou can cast this spell as a reaction when you’re targeted 
by a breath weapon. Doing so gives you advantage on your saving throw against the breath weapon. If your saving throw succeeds, you take no damage from the attack even 
if a successful save normally only halves the damage.
Whether your saving throw succeeded or failed, you 
absorb and store energy from the attack. On your next 
turn, you can make a ranged spell attack against a target within 60 feet. On a hit, the target takes 3d10 force damage. If you opt not to make this attack, the stored energy dissipates harmlessly.

This spell was first invented by dragon parents to assist
their offspring when learning to fly. Y ou gain a flying speed of 60 feet for 1 round. At the start of your next turn, you float rapidly down and land gently on a solid surface beneath you. DRAGON MAGE
Wizards practice the subtle magic of pulling power from thin air and shaping it to fit their needs. Sorcerers tame the chaotic power within themselves, releasing it in barely controlled gouts of magical eruptions. Wizards who walk the path between these two diverse means of using magic are called dragon mages, and they meld the order of wizardry with the chaos of elemental mastery to grant themselves special powers.


WIZARD SPECIALTY
Dragon mages manifest their magic in a variety of styles, as diverse as the kinds of dragons and the types of magic that populate the worlds. Kobolds serving as councilors to great wyrms are taught by their masters to harness their 

206


DRAGON MAGICinnate draconic nature through the use of more traditional
spells. A wild-eyed human, oozing sorcerous magic thanks to an ancient draconic ancestor, might find a kindly wizard to help her focus her power. Special legions of dragonborn troops train with a master dragon mage, learning to better defend their homeland from invaders.
How to Start: If you’re a wizard who wants to become 
a dragon mage, you make that decision upon reaching 2nd level, when you are also entitled to choose an arcane tradition. If you decide to follow the path of the dragon mage exclusively, you can forego the selection of an arcane tradition and gain the features of the dragon mage specialty instead.


Y ou can also pursue the dragon mage specialty in
conjunction with one of the standard arcane traditions. If you choose to do this, you gain the Savant feature of your chosen school in addition to Dragon Magic Savant (described below). Also at 2nd level, you choose whether to gain Invoke Dragon Mask (see below) or the 2nd-level feature of your chosen school. Thereafter, at 6th, 10th, and 14th level, you choose between the lowest-level features still available. For instance, an enchanter might select Hypnotic Gaze at 2nd level and Invoke Dragon Mask at 6th level, followed by either Instinctive Charm or Invoke Dragon Heart at 10th level.


DRAGON MAGIC SAVANT
Beginning when you take up this specialty at 2nd level, the gold and time you must spend to copy a dragon magic spell into your spellbook is halved.

While you wear your dragon mask, you receive the 
following benefits and drawbacks:

• Attack rolls for any ranged or melee attack spells you cast while wearing the mask are made with disadvantage, and saving throws against spells you cast while wearing the mask are made with advantage.

following benefits:

Each creature in the line must make a successful Dexterity saving throw or take 4d6 damage of the chosen type. The damage type cannot be changed while your current dragon heart is active.
• As a bonus action, you can expend an additional spell slot to augment the damage of your next dragon heart breath weapon attack. The damage increases by 2d6 for each level of the expended spell slot, and you can add 10 feet of length to the line for each level of the expended spell slot.

or until the duration expires.The dragon tail is a translucent magical force, in the form of a 15-foot-long appendage capable of striking with great impact.
While you wear your dragon tail, you 
receive the following benefits.
• Y ou are immune to the grappled condition.
• Y ou are have proficiency with Strength and Dexterity saving throws and any ability checks using Strength.       In addition, you can use your Intelligence modifier instead of the normal modifier for those saving throws and checks.• Y ou gain a tail slam attack. As an action, you make a separate melee spell attack against each target within 15 feet of you. On a hit, the target takes bludgeoning damage equal to 3d10 + your Intelligence modifier. A creature hit by this attack is pushed up to 10 feet away from you and knocked prone unless it succeeds on a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC. This attack counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming a target’s immunity or resistance to bludgeoning damage.
• As a reaction, you can make a tail slam attack against a creature that moves to within 15 feet of your tail.
• As a bonus action, you can spend an additional spell slot to augment your dragon tail. Until the start of your next turn, your dragon tail’s slam attack damage increases by 1d10 per level of the spell slot spent. In addition, you heal yourself for 3 hit points per level of the spell slot spent.

EL VEN RITUAL MAGIC
When the elves first developed their magic long ago, the 
spells they learned to use were all cast as rituals. Over time, researchers who came later discovered how to cast most spells more quickly and with greater potency—at the expense of sapping their energy and leaving them in need of recuperation.


Some of the original elven rituals are still being taught
and used today—and just as in the distant past, they can be cast only as rituals. That aspect of their nature sets them apart from all other spells, because it means that anyone who can cast one of these spells can do so repeatedly, without needing to draw on enough of their inner power to deplete their magical ability.
Ritual Focus. Another quality unique to elven ritual 
magic is the ability of the caster to call upon inner reserves and expend extra effort to improve or enhance the effect


El ven Ritual Magic
RITUAL CASTER OR NOT?


Elven ritual magic can be incorporated into the game in
one of two ways, depending mainly on whether the GM uses the rules for feats. If so, then it might be necessary for a character to have the Ritual Caster feat before any of these spells can be employed. If not, then—unless the GM decides otherwise—a character can cast any of these spells as normal, provided that they appear on his or her spell list.of an elven ritual spell. This extra effort is represented by 
the caster’s ritual focus. Each of the spell descriptions ends with a paragraph that explains the effect of expending the ritual focus on the casting of that spell.
209
EL VEN RITUAL MAGICUnlike a normal spellcasting focus, a ritual focus is not 
an object; it’s a state of mind. And once this mental energy 
has been expended, a caster’s ritual focus can’t be used again until he or she finishes a short or long rest.


EL VEN RITUAL MAGIC SPELL LISTS
Most elven ritual spells are usable by more than one class. 
All of them, not surprisingly, are wizard spells, but a relative few can also be cast by sorcerers or warlocks.

Spell Descriptions
The following spells are presented in alphabetical order.


AFFLICT LINE
9th-level necromancy (ritual only)
Casting Time: 1 hourRange: 1 mileComponents: V , S, M (a statuette carved in the 
likeness of the victim worth 1,250 gp)
Duration: Permanent; one generation


Y ou invoke the darkest curses upon your
victim and his or her descendants. This spell does not require that you have a clear path to your target, only that your target is within range. The target must make a successful Wisdom saving throw or be cursed until the magic is dispelled. While cursed, the victim has disadvantage on ability checks and saving throws made with the ability score that you used when you cast the spell. In addition, the target’s firstborn offspring is also targeted by the curse. That individual is allowed a saving throw of its own if it is currently alive, or it makes one upon its birth if it is not yet born when the spell is cast. If the target’s firstborn has already died, the curse passes to the target’s next oldest offspring.
Ritual Focus. If you expend your ritual focus, the curse 
becomes hereditary, passing from firstborn to firstborn for the entire length of the family’s lineage until one of them successfully saves against the curse and throws off your dark magic.
211


EL VEN RITUAL MAGICBLOOM
8th-level conjuration (ritual only)
Casting Time: 1 hourRange: 1 mileComponents: V , S, M (a silver acorn worth 500 gp, which 
is consumed in the casting)
Duration: 1 year


Y ou plant a silver acorn in solid ground and spend an
hour chanting a litany of praises to the natural world, after which the land within 1 mile of the acorn becomes extremely fertile, regardless of its previous state. Any seeds planted in the area grow at twice the natural rate. Food harvested regrows within a week. After one year, the land slowly reverts to its normal fertility, unable to stave off the march of nature.
Choose one of the following effects, which appears and 
grows immediately:
• A field planted with vegetables of your choice, ready for harvest.
• A thick forest of stout trees and ample undergrowth.
• A grassland with wildflowers and fodder for grazing.
• An orchard of fruit trees of your choice, growing in orderly rows and ready for harvest.
Living creatures that take a short rest within the area of a bloom spell receive the maximum hit points for Hit Dice expended. Bloom counters the effects of a desolation spell.
Ritual Focus. If you expend your ritual focus, the 
duration becomes permanent.


CELEBRATION
7th-level enchantment (ritual only)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 90 feetComponents: V , S, M (a small party favor)Duration: 1 hour
Y ou create a 30-foot-radius area around a point that you 
choose within range. An intelligent creature that enters the area or starts its turn there must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature starts to engage in celebratory revelry: drinking, singing, laughing, and dancing. Affected creatures are reluctant to leave the area until the spell ends, preferring to continue the festivities. They forsake appointments, cease caring about their woes, and generally behave in a cordial (if not hedonistic) manner. This preoccupation with merrymaking occurs regardless of an affected creature’s agenda or alignment. Assassins procrastinate, servants join in the celebration rather than working, and guards abandon their posts. The effect ends on a creature when it is attacked, takes 
damage, or is forced to leave the area. A creature that makes a successful saving throw can enter or leave the area without danger of being enchanted. A creature that fails the saving throw and is forcibly removed from the area must repeat the saving throw if it returns to the area.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using 
a spell slot of 8th level or higher, the spell lasts for an additional hour for each slot level above 7th.
Ritual Focus. If you expend your ritual focus, an 
unaffected intelligent creature must make a new saving throw every time it starts its turn in the area, even if it has previously succeeded on a save against the spell.


CLEARING THE FIELD
2nd-level transmutation (ritual only)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 40 feetComponents: V , SDuration: 1 hour
With a harsh word and a vicious chopping motion, you 
cause every tree, shrub, and stump within 40 feet of you to sink into the ground, leaving the vacated area clear of plant life that might otherwise hamper movement or obscure sight. Overgrown areas that counted as difficult terrain become clear ground and no longer hamper movement. The original plant life instantly rises from the ground again when the spell ends or is dispelled. Plant creatures are not affected by clearing the field.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using 
a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the spell lasts for an additional hour for each slot level above 2nd.
Ritual Focus. If you expend your ritual focus, plant 
creatures in the area must make a successful Constitution saving throw or be affected as though by a reduce spell.


DESOLATION
8th-level necromancy (ritual only)
Casting Time: 1 hourRange: SelfComponents: V , S, M (an obsidian acorn worth 500 gp, 
which is consumed in the casting)
Duration: 1 year


Y ou plant an obsidian acorn in solid ground and spend
an hour chanting a litany of curses to the natural world, after which the land within 1 mile of the acorn becomes infertile, regardless of its previous state. Nothing will grow there, and all plant life in the area dies over the course of a day. Plant creatures are not affected. Spells that 
212
EL VEN RITUAL MAGICsummon plants, such as entangle, require an ability check 
using the caster’s spellcasting ability against your spell save DC. On a successful check, the spell functions normally; if the check fails, the spell is countered by desolation.
After one year, the land slowly reverts to its normal 
fertility, unable to stave off the march of nature.


A living creature that finishes a short rest within the
area of a desolation spell halves the result of any Hit Dice it expends. Desolation counters the effects of a bloom spell.
Ritual Focus. If you expend your ritual focus, the 
duration becomes permanent.


ENCROACHING SHADOWS
6th-level illusion (ritual only)
Casting Time: 1 hourRange: 150 feetComponents: V , S, M (a drop of blood smeared on a 
silver rod worth 100 gp)
Duration: 12 hours
Y ou cause menacing shadows to invade an area 200 feet on 
a side and 50 feet high, centered on a point within range. Illumination in the area drops one step (from bright light to dim, or from dim light to darkness). Any spell that creates light in the area that is cast using a lower-level spell slot than was used to cast encroaching shadows is dispelled, and a spell that creates light doesn’t function in the area if that spell is cast using a spell slot of 5th level or lower. Nonmagical effects can’t increase the level of illumination in the affected area.


A spell that creates darkness or shadow takes effect in the
area as if the spell slot expended was one level higher than the spell slot actually used.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using 
a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the effect lasts for an additional 12 hours for each slot level above 6th.
Ritual Focus. If you expend your ritual focus, the spell’s 
duration increases by 12 hours, and it cannot be dispelled by a spell that creates light, even if that spell is cast using a higher-level spell slot.


EXTRACT ESSENCE
1st-level transmutation (ritual only)
Casting Time: 10 minutesRange: 30 feetComponents: V , S, M (a wooden bowl)Duration: Permanent
Y ou extract the goodness from food, pulling all the 
nutritional value out of three days’ worth of meals and concentrating it into a tablespoon of bland, flourlike powder. The flour can be mixed with liquid and drunk or baked into bread. When consumed, it still imparts all the nutritional value of the original food.
The original food appears unchanged, and though it’s 
still filling, it has no nutritional value. 
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 
spell slot of 2nd level or higher, an additional three meals’ worth of food can be extracted for each slot level above 1st.
Ritual Focus. If you expend your ritual focus, you can 
choose to have each day’s worth of meals take the form of a single slice of bread.


GUEST OF HONOR
1st-level enchantment (ritual only)
Casting Time: 10 minutesRange: T ouchComponents: V , M (a signet ring worth 25 gp)Duration: 10 minutes
Y ou whisper words of encouragement, and a creature 
that you touch gains confidence along with approval from strangers. For the spell’s duration, the target puts its best foot forward and strangers associate the creature with positive feelings. The target adds 1d4 to all Charisma (Persuasion) checks made to influence the attitudes of others.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using 
a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the effect lasts for an additional 10 minutes for each slot level above 1st.
Ritual Focus. If you expend your ritual focus, the effect 
lasts for 24 hours.


SHADOWS BROUGHT TO LIGHT
2nd-level divination (ritual only)
Casting Time: 10 minutesRange: 30 feetComponents: V , SDuration: Instantaneous


If a creature you designate within range fails a Charisma
saving throw, you cause the target’s shadow to come to life and reveal one of the creature’s most scandalous secrets: some fact that the target would not want widely known (GM’s choice). When casting the spell, you choose whether everyone present will hear the secret, in which case the shadow speaks loudly in a twisted version of the target’s voice, or if the secret is whispered only to you. The shadow speaks in the target’s native language.


If the target does not have a scandalous secret or does not
have a spoken language, the spell fails as if the creature’s saving throw had succeeded.
If the secret was spoken aloud, the target takes a −2 
penalty to Charisma checks involving anyone who was 
213
EL VEN RITUAL MAGICpresent when it was revealed. This penalty lasts until you 
finish a long rest.
Ritual Focus. If you expend your ritual focus, the target 
has disadvantage on Charisma checks instead of taking the −2 penalty.


SHADOWY RETRIBUTION
4th-level necromancy (ritual only)
Casting Time: 10 minutesRange: SelfComponents: V , S, M (a small silver cup filled with the 
caster’s blood)
Duration: 12 hours
Y ou fill a small silver cup with your own blood (taking 1d4 
piercing damage) while chanting vile curses in the dark. Once the chant is completed, you consume the blood and swear an oath of vengeance against any who harm you.
If you are reduced to 0 hit points, your oath is invoked; 
a shadow materializes within 5 feet of you. The shadow attacks the creature that reduced you to 0 hit points, ignoring all other targets, until it or the target is slain, at which point the shadow dissipates into nothing.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 
spell slot of 5th level or higher, an additional shadow is conjured for each slot level above 4th.
Ritual Focus. If you expend your ritual focus, the spell 
summons a banshee instead of a shadow. If you also use a higher-level spell slot, additional undead are still shadows.


SONG OF THE FOREST
3rd-level transmutation (ritual only)
Casting Time: 10 minutesRange: SelfComponents: V , S, M (a dried leaf, crumpled and 
released)
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
Y ou attune your senses to the natural world, so that 
you detect every sound that occurs within 60 feet: wind blowing through branches, falling leaves, grazing deer, trickling streams, and more. Y ou can clearly picture the source of each sound in your mind. The spell gives you tremorsense out to a range of 10 feet. In addition, you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing. Creatures that make no noise or that are magically silent cannot be detected by this spell’s effect.
Song of the forest functions only in natural environments; 
it fails if cast underground, in a city, or in a building that isolates the caster from nature (GM’s discretion).
Ritual Focus. If you expend your ritual focus, the spell 
also gives you blindsight out to a range of 30 feet.VINE TRESTLE
2nd-level conjuration (ritual only)
Casting Time: 10 minutesRange: 30 feetComponents: V , S, M (a 1-inch piece of green vine that is 
consumed in the casting)
Duration: 1 hour


Y ou cause a vine to sprout from the ground and crawl
across a surface or rise into the air in a direction chosen by you. The vine must sprout from a solid surface (such as the ground or a wall), and it is strong enough to support 600 pounds of weight along its entire length. The vine collapses immediately if that 600-pound limit is exceeded. A vine that collapses from weight or damage instantly disintegrates.
The vine has many small shoots, so it can be climbed with 
a successful DC 5 Strength (Athletics) check. It has AC 8, hit points equal to 5 × your spellcasting level, and a damage threshold of 5.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 
spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the vine can support an additional 30 pounds, and its damage threshold increases by 1 for each slot level above 2nd.
Ritual Focus. If you expend your ritual focus, the vine is 
permanent until destroyed or dispelled.

HIEROGL YPH MAGIC
For countless ages the heat of the deserts and shifting 
sands of these lands have held many secrets that fascinate, delight, and terrify. Ancient knowledge can be found here by those who know how and where to look, unlocking a new world of power and possibility. But beware—this knowledge is difficult to learn and dangerous to the unschooled! Few of its masters are willing to teach their secrets to anyone outside their own sect. But perhaps as an astute linguist, a talented artist, or even a clever mason, you can tap into the secret script of magic from ancient times and unlock the power of hieroglyphs.


Accessing the magic of hieroglyphs requires the Script
Carver and Script Sage feats. If the option to gain feats isn’t used in your campaign, then Script Carver and Script Sage can be gained in place of level-based ability score improvement, if your GM approves. Alternatively, characters might need to accomplish other, story -related 
tasks determined by the GM to gain the abilities bestowed by the Script Carver and Script Sage feats. Once any obstacles are cleared, all characters who meet the prerequisites can gain these feats.


SCRIPT CARVER
Prerequisite: Intelligence 12 or higher


Y ou have learned how to expertly scribe two hieroglyphs
of your choice, and you gain the benefit associated with each one. In addition, you can invoke one power of each hieroglyph you have learned, provided you meet any other requirements, such as a minimum level. 
Y ou can select this feat multiple times. Each time you 
do, you gain the benefit and powers of two additional hieroglyphs of your choice.


Hierogl yph Magic
215


HIEROGL YPH MAGICSCRIPT SAGE
Prerequisite: Script Carver
Through dedicated study, you have mastered one 
hieroglyph of your choice. Choose one hieroglyph that you have already learned through Script Carver. Y ou can invoke one of its mastery powers, provided you meet any other requirements, such as a minimum level.
Y ou can select this feat multiple times. Each time you 
do, you learn the mastery powers of a different hieroglyph from your repertoire.


INVOKING HIEROGLYPH POWERS
Invoking one of a hieroglyph’s powers requires an action and provokes opportunity attacks. Generally, you must either draw a physical representation of the glyph (in paint, in blood, in the dirt or snow, and so forth) or trace the shape of an existing carving of the glyph that was created to an exacting standard.


Each hieroglyph confers a benefit on someone who
knows how to scribe it. A hieroglyph’s benefit is always in effect for a character who knows that hieroglyph. In addition, that character can call upon one of the hieroglyph’s powers when so desired. Unless otherwise noted, all hieroglyph powers can be used once, and that expended use is regained when you finish a long rest. 
Some powers have a level requirement (given in 
parentheses); when a character attains that level, this power becomes an additional choice. Mastery powers are a separate category: only a character who has the Script Sage feat for a particular hieroglyph can use its mastery power. If a power or a mastery power has no level requirement, it becomes available to you as soon as you acquire the necessary feat.
If a hieroglyph power gives you the ability to cast a spell, 
you can do so without needing any components (aside from materials needed for the drawing of the glyph), and the spell is always cast as if using the lowest-level spell slot possible. It typically has the same duration as a normal casting of the spell, and uses your character level as the caster level.
When a hieroglyph power calls for a saving throw, the


DC
equals 8 + your ability bonus + your  proficiency bonus.


The ability that applies to the DC calculation is the same as
the ability used for the saving throw.Hierogl yph Descriptions
The hieroglyphs are presented below in alphabetical order.
AS DOES EVERY GOD, EVERY BIRD, EVERY FISH,


AND EVERY CREEPING WORM
This symbol represents the fertility and abundance of 
animal life and every being’s place in the chain of life.
Benefit: Y ou gain advantage on ability checks or skill 
checks to identify creatures. 
Power : Y ou can use an action to quickly trace this glyph 
in the air and stare down a beast or a monstrosity. The 
targeted creature must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is frightened of you for as long as you continue staring 
at it. While frightened in this way, 
the creature must move at its full speed away from you on each of its turns until you can’t see it or until it makes a successful 
saving throw. An affected creature repeats the 
saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself with a successful save. When a creature’s saving throw is successful (regardless of whether it failed previously), it has disadvantage on attack rolls against you until the end of its next turn.
Mastery Power: 
If you spend 1 minute tracing this glyph 
on the body of an animal, you can grant yourself a measure 
of the animal’s ability. Y ou gain one of the following: a climbing or swimming speed of 30 feet, or a flying or burrowing speed of 20 feet—whichever is most appropriate to the type of animal the bone came from. The effect lasts for as long as you maintain concentration, up to 1 hour.

216
HIEROGL YPH MAGICpetals of flowers, every creature within 10 feet of you must 
make a successful Charisma saving throw or be charmed by you for 1 minute. 
Power (5th Level): Y ou use an action to contemplate 
flower petals as they drift in the breeze, enabling you to cast a gust of wind spell.
Mastery Power: When you use an action to anoint 
yourself with perfume, for the next 10 minutes you have advantage on Charisma checks to influence people within 50 feet of you.
DRINK DEEP OF THE RIVER’S POWER
This hieroglyph represents the flow of magic through the land, as well as the physical flow of rivers.
Benefit: Y ou gain the ability to cast one cantrip of your 
choice from the wizard spell list. Y our spellcasting ability is Intelligence when you cast this cantrip.
Power (2nd Level): Y ou trace this hieroglyph over 
a creature’s eyes in a ritual that takes 10 minutes to perform. When the ritual is complete, it produces a detect magic effect that works on the creature and on any items the creature is holding or carrying. The effect lasts for 1 minute while you maintain concentration.
Mastery Power: Y ou trace this hieroglyph in dirt over 
the course of 1 hour. At the end of the hour, you dispel a magical effect of up to 4th level that is within 120 feet of you. If the effect is higher than 4th level, you dispel it if you make a successful Intelligence (Arcana) check against a DC equal to 10 + the level of the effect.


FLOURISH IN DEATH AS IN LIFE
This symbol represents the transition from the realm of the living to the realm of the dead. It is often engraved on the tombs of fallen heroes. 
Benefit: Y ou gain a +1 bonus on Constitution saving 
throws. 
Power: When you drop to 0 hit points, you become 
stabilized immediately and automatically.
Mastery Power: Y ou can see a distance of 60 feet into 
the Ethereal Plane for 1 hour. Y ou also can determine whether anyone within 60 feet of you is possessed by a spirit; you see such a figure as having a vague, dim outline around it. 

217
HIEROGL YPH MAGICFLY AS THE FALCON, HOWL AS THE WOLF
This symbol represents hunting, tracking, stalking, and 
bringing prey to the ground. 
Benefit: Y ou gain a +1 bonus on Wisdom (Survival) checks. 
Power (2nd Level): When you use an action to trace this symbol on the body of a willing creature, the creature gains darkvision out to a range of 20 feet, which lasts for 1 minute and works even in magical darkness.
Power (4th Level): You trace this hieroglyph on an 
item that belongs to a specific creature or clearly represents a creature you have encountered, then use an action to consume it. For the next hour, the tracks of that creature glow in your sight. Y ou can follow and track the creature automatically while moving at the speed of a forced march
. 
Mastery Power: By using an action to trace this glyph on your hand, you invoke the hunter’s gift against a specific creature. The target must be a creature you have previously used one of this hieroglyph’s powers against. The next time you hit the creature with an attack, it must make a successful Constitution saving throw or take an additional 1d10 necrotic damage from the attack.


GIFTS TAKEN FROM THE SILVER COFFER
This symbol represents gifts, knowledge, secrets, and things hidden. 
Benefit: Y ou gain a +1 bonus on Intelligence 
(Investigation) checks. 
Power: By spending 1 minute in concentration while 
holding a papyrus reed, you can cast the spell speak with inanimate object (see page 107).
Power (4th Level): By taking an action to break open 
an egg, you create an extradimensional space (a “silver coffer”) that is 5 cubic feet in volume and can hold up to 50 pounds of material. This space looks like a simple, empty 
hole in the ground, but when you reach inside it, you always 
find whatever you placed inside. The extradimensional space remains visible as a hole in the ground for 24 hours, then disappears, along with its contents. It can be reopened with another use of this hieroglyph power. The silver coffer’s location on the Material Plane depends on your location when you trigger the hieroglyph. This power always opens the same extradimensional space no matter how much time passes or how far you travel between uses, so it’s not a good way to dispose of, for example, unwanted or dangerous magic items. If the person who created the extradimensional space dies, any items in the silver coffer eventually reappear on their plane of origin at a random location, anytime from a day to several centuries after the creator’s death.Mastery Power (10th Level): By taking an action to rub a 
special brown paste over your eyes that costs 50 gp, you can 
cast true seeing on yourself.


GIVE SUCCOR TO THY PEOPLE
This symbol represents charity, healing, benevolent leadership, and sanctuary given to friends and kin as well as enemies. 
Benefit: Y ou have advantage on Wisdom (Medicine) 
checks.
Power: If you spend an hour in meditation while holding 
a mug of beer or a goblet of wine, your sincere wish to help someone transfers into the brew. When a creature drinks the brew, it gains all the benefits of finishing a short rest. This brew remains potent for 24 hours.
Mastery Power: If you spend an hour in meditation 
while holding a full waterskin, up to six creatures that drink from the waterskin recover from two levels of exhaustion and don’t need any food or water until after finishing a long rest. The water remains potent for up to 24 hours, or until six creatures have drunk it.
THE GODS’ COMPANY IS LIKE LIGHT
This symbol represents knowledge gained over an extended time through dedication and effort.
Benefit: Y ou gain the ability to speak and read one 
additional language of your choice. 
Power: After meditating on this hieroglyph for 10 
minutes, you can cast comprehend languages. 
Power (2nd Level): If you take an action to trace this 
symbol on your forehead or that of another creature, the recipient gains advantage on Intelligence checks for 1 minute. 
Mastery Power: By inhaling incense and powders over 
the course of an hour, you call upon your ancestors to reveal a bit of knowledge from the past. This knowledge enables you to gain your ancestors’ assistance with a problem immediately before you. The implementation of this benefit is up to the GM; you might receive a specific clue that helps you to solve the problem, or you might gain proficiency for 1 hour with a skill or a set of tools, or advantage on a single type of skill check for the same length of time. 
218


HIEROGL YPH MAGICGRASPING ARMS OF BALANCE
This symbol represents the judgment of the dead, 
ever watchful and weighing the actions of the living in expectation of the moment when they eventually pass on from the world.
Benefit: Y ou gain a +1 bonus on Intelligence 
(Investigation) checks.
Power: Y ou trace this hieroglyph in ash on the body of 
a willing creature, which requires an action. For the next 
hour, the creature has advantage on Wisdom ability checks. 
Power (3rd Level): If you use an action to trace this hieroglyph in the air with your fingers, you force a creature you can see to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, you can immediately give the creature one command, either verbally or in writing, that can be completed in the next minute. The creature must try to obey the command to the best of its ability, provided that doing so won’t directly harm it. If the task isn’t completed within 1 minute, the glyph’s power wears off and the creature is freed from the compulsion. 
Mastery Power (9th Level): Y ou spend 10 minutes 
decorating a piece of paper with this hieroglyph. If you then take an action to burn the paper, you can cast a geas spell on one target. As with a normal casting of the spell, you and the target must have a language in common for the effect to work.


HE HATH REPULSED THE FIENDS
This symbol represents the prevention of harm, usually through the protection of devoted soldiers or bodyguards.
Benefit: When you wear no armor, your Armor Class 
is equal to 10 + your Wisdom modifier + your Dexterity modifier. 
Power (3rd Level): If you take an action to trace 
this hieroglyph on a creature, you grant that creature resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage (your choice) for 1 minute. 
Power (5th Level):


By taking an action to burn a bit
of incense , you can conjure a squad of soldiers. These 
soldiers can appear different to different creatures; some 
might see a squad of orcs, others a group of the king's guards. The soldiers appear standing inside a 10-foot-square space within 10 feet of you, and they can’t leave that space. Within that space, they behave like a swarm; other creatures can enter the space and end their turn there. Whenever one of your enemies enters the soldiers’ space or starts its turn in the space or within 5 feet of it, the soldiers attack that creature. Their attack bonus is equal to your Wisdom modifier + your proficiency modifier, and 
a successful attack deals 2d6 force damage. The soldiers remain for 1 minute, provided you maintain concentration on them. They are immune to all forms of damage and can’t be dispelled except by breaking your concentration.
Mastery Power (8th Level): If you take an action to trace this hieroglyph on the ground and then throw a handful of sand into the air, you can cast banishment.


HOLD THE STORM IN AN URN OF THE WIND
This symbol represents the power of storms and wind and the effect these phenomena can have on the world. 
Benefit: Y ou can resist any effect or attack that would 
move you, causing you to be moved 5 feet less than the effect’s normal distance.
Power (3rd Level): By drawing this hieroglyph in the 
air for three consecutive turns (each one requiring an action), you gain the ability to cast wind wall.
Power (5th Level):
 After spending an hour in

ILLUMINATION MAGICIllumination magic concerns both the manipulation of
light and observations of the heavens . Its practitioners 
have been likened to elemental specialists who have an affinity for light instead of fire, earth, air, or water. Naturally, these individuals are anathema to creatures and spellcasters that lurk in places where darkness and shadow hold sway. ILLUMINATION MAGIC SPELL LISTS

SPREADING THE LIGHT
Sharp ‑eyed readers will note that some of the spells 
described in the standard rules are given out to classes 
that were not originally included in those classes' spell lists. Granting access to those spells to a wider range of classes is a deliberate change, meant to showcase the expanded power and utility of illumination magic. If the GM decides that this approach is too generous, some or all of these adjustments might be disallowed.

ILLUMINATION MAGICSpell Descriptions
The following spells are presented in alphabetical order.


AMPLIFY LIGHT
1st-level transmutation (illumination)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: T ouchComponents: V , S, M (a nonmagical light source)Duration: Special


Y ou touch a nonmagical light source and increase its
brightness. While the spell is in effect, the radius of the bright light around the source is doubled, and dim light extends for the same distance beyond that area. The light source’s duration is halved, however, so that a torch affected by amplify light would burn out in half an hour, or a hooded lantern would burn through its fuel in 3 hours. Adding new fuel to a light source while it is under the effect of amplify light will end the spell and return it to its normal brightness.


BURNING RADIANCE
6th-level evocation (illumination)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: Self (60-foot line)Components: V , SDuration: Instantaneous
A line of light 60 feet long and 5 feet wide emanates from 
you in a direction of your choice. Each creature in the line must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 10d8 radiant damage and catches fire; until someone takes an action to douse the fire, the creature takes 1d10 fire damage at the start of each of its turns. A successful saving throw halves the damage and prevents a creature from catching fire.


The burning radiance ignites flammable objects in the
area that aren’t being worn or carried.


GREATER PROTECTIVE NIMBUS
5th-level abjuration (illumination)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: SelfComponents: V , S, M (a transparent gemstone worth at 
least 50 gp)
Duration: 10 minutes


Y ou wrap yourself in a powerful corona that sheds bright
light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. Until the spell ends, you have resistance to necrotic damage and radiant damage. Y ou can end the spell early by using an action to dismiss it, which creates a blast of light in a 30-foot radius. The blast deals 4d8 radiant damage to each creature in the area while simultaneously healing yourself of an equal amount of damage.


GUIDING STAR
1st-level divination (ritual) (illumination)
Casting Time: 10 minutesRange: SelfComponents: V , SDuration: 8 hours
By observing the stars or the position of the sun, you are 
able to determine the cardinal directions, as well as the direction and distance to a stated destination. Y ou can’t become directionally disoriented or lose track of the destination. The spell doesn’t, however, reveal the best route to your destination or warn you about deep gorges, flooded rivers, or other impassable or treacherous terrain.


LAST RAYS OF THE DYING SUN
7th-level evocation (illumination)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 40 feetComponents: V , SDuration: Instantaneous
A burst of searing heat explodes from you, dealing 6d6 
fire damage to all enemies within range. Immediately afterward, a wave of frigid cold rolls across the same area, 
dealing 6d6 cold damage to enemies. A creature that makes a successful Dexterity saving throw takes half the damage.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th or 9th level, the damage from both waves increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 7th.


ORB OF LIGHT
2nd-level evocation (illumination)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 60 feetComponents: V , SDuration: 1 round


An orb of light the size of your hand shoots from your
fingertips toward a creature within range, which takes 3d8 radiant damage and is blinded for 1 round. A target that makes a successful Dexterity saving throw takes half the damage and is not blinded.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 
spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.
225


ILLUMINATION MAGICPHANTOM LIGHT
2nd-level illusion (illumination)
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: T ouchComponents: V , S, M (a small sketch of a candle)Duration: 1 hour
Y ou touch one object that measures less than 10 
feet in every dimension. Until the spell ends, the object sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. The light can be colored as you like. At the time of the casting, you designate up to six creatures. Only those creatures are able to see and gain benefit from the phantom light.


The object can be covered with something opaque to
block the light. Y ou can use an action to dismiss this spell.


PROTECTIVE NIMBUS
3rd-level abjuration (illumination)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: SelfComponents: V , S, M (a crystal or glass bead)Duration: 10 minutes


Y ou wrap yourself in a corona that sheds bright light
in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. Until the spell ends, you have resistance to necrotic damage. Y ou can end the spell early by using an action to dismiss it.


SEARING SUN
4th-level transmutation (illumination)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 200 feetComponents: V , S, M (a magnifying lens)Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
This spell intensifies the light and heat of the sun, so 
that it burns exposed flesh. Y ou must be able to see the sun when you cast the spell. The searing sunlight affects a cylindrical area 50 feet in radius and 200 feet high, centered on the a point within range. Each creature that starts its turn in that area takes 5d8 fire damage, or half the damage with a successful Constitution saving throw. A creature that’s shaded by a solid object —such as an awning, a building, or an overhanging boulder— has advantage on the saving throw. On your turn, you can use an action to move the center of the cylinder up to 20 feet along the ground in any direction
.SHIELD OF STARLIGHT
3rd-level abjuration (illumination)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: SelfComponents: V , S, M (a star chart)Duration: 10 minutes


Y ou wrap yourself in a protective shroud of the night sky
made from swirling shadows and punctuated by twinkling motes of light. The shroud grants you resistance against either radiant or necrotic damage (your choice when the spell is cast). Y ou also shed dim light in a 10-foot radius. Y ou can end the spell early by using an action to dismiss it. 

226


ILLUMINATION MAGICSOOTHING INCANDESCENCE
7th-level evocation (illumination)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: Self (30-foot radius)Components: V , SDuration: Concentration, up to 1 hour
A soft, white radiance spreads out from a point just above 
your head, creating bright light in a 30-foot radius around your present location. If you move from your present location, the area of light remains fixed. A creature in the area other than a fiend or an undead regains 1 hit point at the start of each of its turns while within the bright light. Each fiend or undead in the area takes 2d4 radiant damage at the start of each of its turns.


STARBURST
Evocation cantrip (illumination)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 60 feetComponents: V , SDuration: Instantaneous


Y ou cause a mote of starlight to appear and explode in a
5-foot cube you can see within range. If a creature is in the cube, it must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or take 1d8 radiant damage.
This spell’s damage increases to 2d8 when you reach 5th 
level, 3d8 when you reach 11th level, and 4d8 when you reach 17th level.


STARFALL
5th-level evocation (illumination)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 60 feetComponents: V , SDuration: Instantaneous


Y ou cause bolts of shimmering starlight to fall from the
heavens, striking up to five creatures that you can see within range. Each bolt strikes one target, dealing 6d6 radiant damage, knocking the target prone, and blinding it until the start of your next turn. A creature that makes a successful Dexterity saving throw takes half the damage, is not knocked prone, and is not blinded. If you name fewer than five targets, excess bolts strike the ground harmlessly.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using 
a spell slot of 6th level or higher, you can create one additional bolt for each slot level above 5th.STAR’S HEART
9th-level transmutation (illumination)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 50 feetComponents: V , S, M (an ioun stone)Duration: 1 minute
This spell increases gravity tenfold in a 50-foot radius 
centered on you. Each creature in the area other than you drops whatever it’s holding, falls prone, becomes incapacitated, and can’t move. If a solid object (such as the ground) is encountered when a flying or levitating creature falls, the creature takes three times the normal falling damage. Any creature except you that enters the area or starts its turn there must make a successful Strength saving throw or fall prone and become incapacitated and unable to move. A creature that starts its turn prone and incapacitated makes a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 8d6 bludgeoning damage; on a successful save, it takes 4d6 bludgeoning damage, it’s no longer incapacitated, and it can move at half speed.


All ranged weapon attacks inside the area have a normal
range of 5 feet and a maximum range of 10 feet. The same applies to spells that create missiles that have mass, such as flaming sphere. A creature under the influence of a freedom of movement spell or comparable magic has advantage on the Strength saving throws required by this spell, and its speed isn’t reduced once it recovers from being incapacitated.


SUMMON STAR
8th-level conjuration (illumination)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 90 feetComponents: V , SDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute


Y ou summon a friendly star from the heavens to do your
bidding. It appears in an unoccupied space you can see within range and takes the form of a glowing humanoid with long white hair. All creatures other than you who view the star must make a successful Wisdom saving throw or be charmed for the duration of the spell. A creature charmed in this way can repeat the Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a success, the creature is no longer charmed and is immune to the effect of this casting of the spell. In all other ways, the star is equivalent to a deva. It understands and obeys verbal commands you give it. If you do not give the star a command, it defends itself and attacks the last creature that attacked it. The star disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends. 
227


ILLUMINATION MAGICTRACKING BEACON
3rd-level divination (illumination)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 120 feetComponents: V , SDuration: Concentration, up to 8 hours


Y ou choose a creature within range to mark with a
glowing orb of light, which floats 120 feet above the creature’s head. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the spell ends. On a failed save, the light hovers above the target’s location, moving as the target moves, which enables you to track the creature
’s direction and distance by staying within 
sight of the beacon. The beacon continues to function even when you cannot see it, as long as the target remains on the same plane as you. If either you or the target travels to another plane, the spell ends.


Y ou can use a bonus action on your turn to adjust the
height of the beacon, ranging from its starting point of 120 feet to as low as 5 feet above the head of the target.


ILLUMINATOR
Wizards who pursue illumination magic, called illuminators, use the stars to predict when danger is near, and they draw on the power of light to attack their foes.


WIZARD SPECIALTY
This branch of magic is popular with those who delve underground, because its spells work best where light is dim or absent.
How to Start: If you’re a wizard who wants 
to become an illuminator, you make that decision upon reaching 2nd level, when you are also entitled to choose an arcane tradition. If you decide to follow the path of the illuminator exclusively, you can forego the selection of an arcane tradition and gain the features of the illuminator specialty instead.Y ou can also pursue the illuminator specialty in 
conjunction with one of the standard arcane traditions. If you choose to do this, you gain the Savant feature of your chosen school in addition to Illumination Magic Savant (described below). Also at 2nd level, you choose whether to gain Omen of Warning (see below) or the 2nd-level feature of your chosen school. Thereafter, at 6th, 10th, and 14th level, you choose between the lowest-level features still available. For instance, a diviner might select Portent 

228
ILLUMINATION MAGICat 2nd level and Omen of Warning at 6th level, followed 
by either Expert Divination or Master of the Radiant Heavens at 10th level.


ILLUMINATION MAGIC SAVANT
Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and time needed to copy illumination spells into your spellbook is halved.


OMEN OF WARNING
Starting at 2nd level, you can forecast danger for the next 24 hours by studying the stars for 1 hour. The stars must be visible to you for you to use this feature. Studying the stars in this way gives you advantage on up to two initiative rolls. The bonus remains for 24 hours or until the end of your next long rest. 
Instead of using this feature on yourself, you can grant 
advantage on an initiative roll to one other creature you can see when initiative rolls are made, but doing this prevents you from using the benefit on yourself in that combat. Y ou can choose whether to use this feature at the moment initiative is rolled, but you must make the decision before rolling the die.


MASTER OF THE RADIANT HEAVENS
Starting when you reach 6th level, the spell attack modifier and spell save DC for any cantrips you cast in dim light or darkness increases by 1.


ILLUSIONS OF PERMANENCE
Beginning at 10th level, illusion spells you cast that require concentration last for 1 round after you stop concentrating, as long as the spell hasn’t exceeded its duration.COMPREHENSION OF THE STARRY SKY
Starting at 14th level, during a long rest you can consult the stars and comprehend some meaning in a cosmic event. The stars must be visible to you for you to use this ability. The insight you gather is stored as a small reserve of magic inside an item that has meaning to you; a star chart or an astrolabe is commonly used, but any item that can be held in your hand will suffice. When the item is in your hand, you can consume that stored magic as a bonus action to produce one of the effects described below. The insight is expended in one use, and it is lost if it hasn’t been used within 24 hours or by the time you start your next long rest.
Comet: Comets are the harbingers of change and 
instability. Y ou can change your appearance as if you had cast an alter self spell, but the effect doesn’t require concentration and lasts until you finish a long rest.
Conjunction: Planetary conjunctions destabilize 
minds and emotions. Y ou can give one creature you can see disadvantage on a saving throw against one enchantment or illusion spell you cast.
Eclipse: Eclipses plunge the world into darkness and 
strengthen connections to the shadow plane. When you cast a spell of 5th level or lower that deals necrotic damage, you can reroll a number of damage dice equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one die). You must use the new rolls.

RING MAGIC
Dwarves are renowned as shapers of the physical world. 
Earth, stone, and metal bend to the will of dwarven hammers. It’s easy to assume that because dwarves have such great skill at shaping material, they must lack the time and energy to become masters of the arcane, too—but that assumption is wrong. T aking unformed matter and shaping it to conform to one’s will is an effective way of blending the physical and arcane arts. The dwarves’ greatest magic has come from this effort, as evidenced by the legendary weapons, armor, and implements of war that emerge from their mountain strongholds. Few dwarves pursue the study of magic aside from devotion to their deities, but one discipline bridges the gap between creation and spellcasting: ring magic.Ring magic is the dwarven art of forging metal into rings, 
often with runes inscribed on their surface, and using those rings to produce or bring about magical effects. Dedicated practitioners known as ring wardens channel their magic through specially prepared rings, increasing the devastation wreaked upon their foes, and they can even imbue spells into rings that they or someone else can unleash later.


Rings created for the purpose of invoking ring magic
are more than decorative hand jewelry. They often take the form of circlets of precious metal large enough to adorn a weapon, a staff, or a suit of armor. Wizards who devote themselves to ring magic are rare outside the dwarves’ lands, but they’re instantly recognizable by the 
ring -adorned stafffs they carry.


Ring Magic
230


RING MAGICAlthough ring magic spells often require a ring of
some form as a material component, the effects they 
produce are quite distinct and variable, from illusions to transmutations and evocations. What they have in common is that dwarves have uncovered a way to bind the effects into rings; the deeper arcane connection between the rings and the spells is sometimes elusive.

each of your turns after the spell is cast. Any creatures or objects enveloped in the enlarged area are subject to its effects immediately.

The spiked ring in your hand expands into a long, barbed 
chain to ensnare a creature you touch. Make a melee spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target is bound in metal chains for the duration. While bound, the target can move only at half speed and has disadvantage on attack rolls, saving throws, and Dexterity checks. If it moves more than 5 feet during a turn, it takes 3d6 piercing damage from the barbs.

Y ou lay a curse upon a ring you touch that
isn’t being worn or carried. When you cast this spell, select one of the possible effects of bestow curse. The next creature that willingly wears the ring suffers the chosen effect with no saving throw. The curse transfers from the ring to the wearer once the ring is put on; the ring becomes a mundane ring that can be taken off, but the curse remains on the creature that wore the ring until the curse is removed or dispelled. An identify spell cast on the cursed ring 
reveals the fact that it is cursed.

The charmed creature regards you as a friend. When 
the spell ends, it doesn’t know it was charmed by you, but it does realize that its attitude toward you has changed (possibly greatly) in a short time. How the creature reacts to you and regards you in the future is up to the GM.HOARFROST

20 feet of you. Y ou and each creature in the area that you choose to affect take on the appearance of a harmless creature or object, chosen by you. Each image is identical, and only appearance is affected. Sound, movement, or physical inspection can reveal the ruse.


A creature that uses its action to study the image visually

RING STRIKE
1st-level transmutation (ring)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: SelfComponents: V , S, M (two metal rings)Duration: 1 hour

RING MAGICRING MAGIC FEATS
The ring is a powerful shape, with no beginning or end, 
and potent ties to life. These feats allow any character to experience the distinctive power of ring magic.


CIRCLE SPELLCASTER
Prerequisite: The ability to cast at least one spell.


Y ou have learned to create a circular flow of magic between
yourself and an allied spellcaster to bolster your spells. Y ou gain the following benefits:
• Increase your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
• Y ou can spend 2 hours (which can be during a long rest) creating a mystical bond with another spellcaster. Both of you must spend this time in meditation, and you must remain within 10 feet of each other. The bond goes into effect when the meditation is over (or when you finish your long rest). Once the bond is formed, the two of you can bolster one another’s magic. When one of you must make a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on a spell, the other can use his or her reaction to help maintain the effect. Both of you make the saving throw. If either save is successful, the caster maintains concentration. If both saves are failed, both of you lose concentration on any spells you are maintaining and each of you takes 2d6 psychic damage from the strain. Y ou can maintain this bond with only one spellcaster at a time. If you create a new bond, the previous one breaks. Otherwise, the bond lasts until you finish your next long rest.


RING-BOUND
Prerequisite: The ability to cast at least one spell.


Y ou have acquired a magic-imbued ring as a token of
respect. Y ou gain the following benefits from the ring:
• Y ou have advantage on saving throws against transmutation spells.
• Y ou can physically bind your ring to a weapon with 1 hour of work that can be completed during a short rest. While the ring is attached to the weapon, you can use a bonus action to make the weapon magical until the start of your next turn. After activating this ability twice, you must finish a short or long rest before using it again.
• Ring wardens and others who respect the traditions of ring magic are favorably disposed toward you. Their starting attitude toward you automatically improves by one step, and you have advantage on Charisma checks related to social interaction with such individuals.RING WARDEN
The dwarves long ago discovered the means to infuse magic into rings, and the first ring wardens came into being soon after that discovery came to light.


WIZARD SPECIALTY
With a focus on the school of transmutation, ring wardens blend dwarven craftsmanship with arcane might. They are rarely encountered outside dwarven nations, but they are easy to recognize thanks to their signature ring-staves.
Except as noted below, ring wardens function as 
transmuters and use the wizard spell list.


TRANSMUTATION SAVANT
Beginning when you select this specialty at 2nd level, the gold and time you must spend to copy a transmutation spell into your spellbook is halved.


RING SAVANT
In addition, the gold and time you must spend to copy a ring magic spell into your spellbook is halved.


BONUS PROFICIENCY
Also at 2nd level, you gain proficiency in your choice of blacksmith’s tools or jeweler’s tools.


BONDED RING-STAFF
At 2nd level, you create a special quarterstaff with two special metal rings adorning it. When you roll damage for a spell attack while you hold your ring-staff, you can add your proficiency bonus to the result. If the spell allows for multiple damage rolls against multiple targets (such as with scorching ray), you must choose which roll gains the benefit before you roll the die. Y ou can use this ability a number of times equal to the number of rings on your staff. Y ou regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.
 
Whenever you gain a new wizard level, you can attach a 
new ring to your staff by spending 8 hours of work with blacksmith’s tools or jeweler’s tools and paying a cost of 5 gp in raw materials.


MASTER METALSMITH
Beginning at 6th level, you can add twice your normal proficiency bonus when you use the tools you chose at 2nd level.


When using your chosen tools to craft nonmagical
or magical items, you make twice the normal amount of 
progress each day.
Additionally, you learn the method for crafting a single 
kind of magic ring chosen from the following list: ring of jumping, ring of mind shielding, ring of protection, ring of the ram , ring of regeneration, or ring of resistance. At the GM’s 
discretion, you can choose a ring not listed here. Y ou must 
235


RING MAGIC
meet all the standard prerequisites for crafting the ring and 
pay the required gold as normal, along with providing any special materials or meeting any conditions set by the GM.


IMBUE RING
Starting at 10th level, you can imbue magic into the special rings that decorate your ring-staff. When you cast a spell, instead of having it take effect normally, you can choose to store the spell in one of the rings. As long as the spell is stored, you can’t regain the expended spell slot. Y ou can remove an imbued ring from the staff and give it to another creature (or hold it yourself) as an action. A creature holding an imbued ring can release the stored spell as an action. Attack rolls, saving throws, and damage are based on the caster who imbued the ring, but the creature holding the ring counts as the spell’s caster for all other purposes.


After you remove an imbued ring from the
staff, you must create a new special ring and affix it to the staff by working for 8 hours and spending 5 gp in raw materials. An imbued ring is considered a magical effect for the purpose of dispel magic. Y ou can have a number of rings imbued at one time equal to your proficiency bonus.


RING BOND
At 14th level or higher, with 1 hour of work (which can be accomplished during a short rest), you can embed a single magic ring that you possess into your ring-staff. The ring's rarity must be common, uncommon, or rare. As long as you hold the ring-staff, you gain the effect of the embedded ring as if you were attuned to it and wearing it (including any negative effects of attuning to the item, such as curses). This embedded ring doesn’t count as one of your three allowable attuned magic items.
With one hour of work, you can remove an embedded 
ring (along with its attunement) and replace it with a new one if desired.
236


RUNE MAGIC
Writing can be an expression of magic, and a way to trap 
and focus arcane energy. This precept is the foundation of rune magic, which requires carving, writing, or otherwise generating glyphs, sigils, signs, and runes of many kinds. This practice is quite common among many different people, from dwarves and druids to northlanders and even some goblin tribes. The rune magic presented here is somewhat northern-flavored, but it could easily serve for dwarven runes, druidic ogham, or goblin graffiti magic. The deeper understanding is that shapes bind power, and that magic can be made tangible. That tangible magic can be a stone rune, a silvery sigil, or even a bloody scrawl—its power functions regardless of how it was made.Rune Powers
Accessing the magic inherent within runes requires the Rune Knowledge feat. If the option to gain feats isn’t used in your campaign, then Rune Knowledge can be gained in place of level-based ability score improvement, if your GM approves. Alternatively, characters might need to accomplish other, story-related tasks determined by the GM to gain Rune Knowledge. Once those obstacles are cleared, all characters who meet the prerequisites can gain Rune Knowledge and Rune Mastery. A character who acquires the Rune Knowledge feat can begin making use of the runes described here.


Rune Magic
237


RUNE MAGIC
When one of your rune powers calls for a saving throw, the 
DC is equal to 8 + your ability modifier + your proficiency 
bonus. Y our applicable ability modifier is the same one being used for the saving throw unless a different ability is specified; for example, if a rune calls for a Charisma saving throw, your Charisma modifier is used to set the DC
.


RUNE KNOWLEDGE
Prerequisite: Wisdom 12 or higher
Y ou are wise in the lore of two runes of your choice. Y ou 
always have access to the benefit that a rune provides. In addition, you can invoke one rune power of each rune you have learned, provided you meet any other requirements such as a minimum level.
Y ou can select this feat multiple times. Each time you do, 
you gain the benefit and powers of two additional runes of your choice.


RUNE MASTERY
Prerequisite: Rune Mastery
Y ou have mastered the special powers of one rune. Choose 
one rune that you have already learned through Rune Knowledge. Y ou can invoke one of its mastery powers, provided you meet any other requirements such as a minimum level
.
Y ou can select this feat multiple times. Each time you do, 
you learn the mastery powers of a different rune from your repertoire.


Invoking  Rune Powers
Invoking one of a rune’s powers requires an action and provokes opportunity attacks. Generally, you must either create a physical representation of the rune (in paint, in blood, drawn in the dirt or snow, and so forth) or trace the shape of an existing carving of the rune that was created to an exacting standard.


Each rune confers a benefit on someone who knows how
to scribe it. A rune ’s benefit is always in effect for a character 
who knows that rune. In addition, that character can call upon one of the rune's powers when so desired. Unless 
otherwise noted, any rune power can be used once, and that 
expended use is regained when you finish a long rest . 
Some powers have a level requirement (given in 
parentheses); when a character attains that level, this power becomes an additional choice. Mastery powers are a separate category: only a character who has the Rune Mastery feat for a particular rune can use its mastery power. If a power or a mastery power has no level requirement, it becomes available to you as soon as you acquire the necessary feat
.If a rune’s power gives you the ability to cast a spell, you 
can do so without needing any components (aside from 
materials needed for the drawing of the rune), and the spell is always cast as if using the lowest-level spell slot possible. It typically has the same duration as a normal casting of the 
spell, and uses your character level as the caster level .
When a rune power calls for a saving throw, the DC 
equals 8 + your ability bonus + your proficiency bonus. Typically, the ability that applies to the DC calculation is the same as the ability used for the saving throw.


Rune descriptions
The following runes are presented in alphabetical order.


ALGIZ
Elk and reindeer, evading danger; the god


Heimdall
Benefit: Y ou gain a +1 bonus on  
initiative rolls.
Power (5th level): Living creatures that 
are within 10 feet of an algiz rune when you draw it on the ground or on a wall gain a +2 bonus on Wisdom (Perception) checks and have advantage on saving throws against sleep spells and other magical effects that cause unconsciousness. Both effects last for 8 hours. Scribing the rune takes 15 minutes.
Mastery Power (8th Level): Marking a willing 
creature with the algiz rune transforms the creature into an elk, as if by a polymorph spell. Drawing the rune on the creature takes an action, and the change lasts while you concentrate, for up to 1 hour.


ANSUZ
Gods and outsiders
Benefit: Y ou gain a +1 bonus on 
Intelligence (Arcana) checks to identify the type, powers, or weaknesses of aberrations, celestials, fey, or fiends. 
Power: 
Once per day, the ansuz rune can be sketched on 
an object to ward off giants and fey hostile to the Aesir. The 
object must be presented boldly toward such creatures, each of which must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature must stay at least 5 feet away from the rune and cannot touch or make melee attacks against the creature presenting it, as long as the symbol is boldly and aggressively presented (which requires an action each round). Sketching the rune takes an action, and the marked object remains effective for 1 minute.

238
RUNE MAGICPower (7th level): If you sketch ansuz on a floor or a 
wall, each of your allies within 10 feet of it can roll a d4 and add the result to each of its attack rolls, similar to the effect of a bless spell. Sketching the rune takes two actions, and it 
remains effective thereafter for as long as you concentrate, for up to 1 minute.
Mastery Power (11th level): When you trace ansuz on the forehead of a willing creature, the creature falls into a trance, during which it receives a message from the gods (identical in effect to a divination spell). A creature can experience only one such trance per week. T racing the rune takes 10 minutes, and the trance lasts for 1 round.


BERKANAN
Birch tree, love, new beginnings; the Bear Maiden
Benefit: Y ou gain a +1 bonus on Charisma  
(Persuasion) checks.Power: When you trace berkanan on a 
living creature, the rune grants the creature advantage on a single Charisma (Persuasion) check of its choosing. T racing the rune takes 10 minutes, and it remains effective for up to 1 hour.
When you trace this rune on a living plant, an effect 
identical to a spike growth spell erupts in a 20-foot radius around the rune. T racing the rune on a plant takes an action, and the effect lasts while you concentrate, for up to 10 minutes.
Mastery Power (8th level): Y ou can create a philter of 
love once a week.


DAGAZ
Day and laying the dead to rest
Benefit: Y ou can always tell whether a 
creature you can see within 10 feet of you is alive or dead.
Power (4th level): If you use an action 
to trace dagaz on a creature that is blinded, deafened, paralyzed, poisoned, or diseased, the creature’s affliction is cured as if by a lesser restoration spell.
Power (6th level): T racing dagaz on an object makes 
it give off bright light in a 60-foot radius and dim light for 60 feet beyond that. Magical darkness of 3rd level or lower is dispelled in an area where this light overlaps it. The light is blocked as normal by opaque objects or structures. T racing the rune for this purpose takes an action, and the light lasts while you concentrate, for up to 1 hour.Mastery Power (13th level): Once a week, you can sketch dagaz on the ground or a wall to create an instantaneous effect identical to a cleric’s T urn Undead class feature. Sketching the rune takes an action, and it affects undead within 30 feet that can see it at the moment of its completion.


EHWAZ
Horses, freedom, the Nithing Pole
Benefit: Y ou gain a +1 bonus to Wisdom 
(Animal Handling) checks made to 
control a mount, and to Dexterity checks made to wriggle free of bonds.
Power (5th level): Using an action to trace ehwaz on 
a lock or a set of shackles has the same effect as casting a knock spell, but makes no sound.
Mastery Power (8th level): When you sketch ehwaz 
on the ground, you can produce the effect of a phantom steed spell. Sketching the rune takes 5 minutes, and the illusory steed remains for 1 hour or until it takes damage.
Mastery Power (9th level): Y ou can create a nithing 
pole once per month. The process can be performed only during a new moon, takes 12 hours, and requires bloodletting that leaves a permanent scar in the shape of the ehwaz rune on the rune maker’s left hand. Each new use of this power creates a new scar; those after the first don’t need to be on the hand, but they must be on the hands or arms.


NITHING POLE
Wondrous item, rare


A nithing pole is crafted to exact retribution for an act of
cowardice or dishonor. It is a sturdy wooden staff, 6 to 10 feet long, carved with runes that name the dishonored target of the staff ’s curse. The carved shaft is draped in 
horsehide, topped with a horse’s skull, and placed where its target is expected to pass by; typically, the pole is driven into 
the ground or wedged into a rocky cleft in a remote spot, where the intended victim won’t see it until it’s too late
.


A pole is created to punish a certain person for a specific
crime. The target must be named on the pole; a description such as “the person who blinded Lars Gustafson” isn’t precise enough. The moment the target approaches within 60 feet, the pole casts bestow curse (with a range of 60 feet instead of touch) on the target. The DC for the target’s Wisdom saving throw is 15. On a successful save, the pole recasts the spell every round until the target’s saving throw is a failure, the target retreats out of range, or the nithing pole is destroyed. Anyone other than the pole’s creator who tries to destroy or knock down a nithing pole is also targeted by a bestow curse spell, but only once.

239


RUNE MAGICY ou determine the effect of the curse when the pole is
created. The pole becomes nonmagical only after it has 
laid its curse on its intended target; an untriggered and forgotten nithing pole remains dangerous for centuries. The curse, once activated, lasts for 8 hours and doesn’t require concentration.


EIWAZ
Y ew tree, Yggdrasil
Benefit: Y ou have proficiency on 
Intelligence (Arcana) checks.
Power (4th level): Spending an action 
to trace eiwaz onto a suitably sized piece of 
wood subjects it to the effect of a shillelagh spell for 1 minut
e. This power is usable at will.
Mastery Power (8th level): If you take 1 minute to write out three questions on a piece of paper or parchment and trace eiwaz on the bottom of the sheet, you can later produce an effect similar to a contact other plane spell (including the possible negative consequences).


If you
later sleep for at least 10 minutes while holding the sheet, your dreams yield answers to those questions that you can receive when you awaken if you make a successful Intelligence saving throw. 
Mastery Power (11th level): When carved on the 
bark of a living tree, eiwaz allows you to travel between that tree and another tree within 500 feet that you have previously marked with eiwaz, as if both were under the effect of a tree stride spell. Each carving takes an action, and the effect lasts while you concentrate, for up to 1 minute after the second carving is finished.


FEHU
Cattle, livestock, and wealth
Benefit: Y ou have advantage on Wisdom 
(Animal Handling) checks concerning domesticated animals that aren’t used as riding mounts.
Power: Sketching fehu on an object makes that item 
easier to lift or drag, as if it were only half its actual weight. Sketching the rune takes 1 minute, and the effect lasts while you concentrate, for up to 1 hour. This power works equally well on a single object, such as a block of stone, or on a collection of objects that are bundled together, such as a large chest stuffed with coins.
Mastery Power (8th level): By spending 1 minute 
tracing fehu on your skin, you can cast dominate beast as though from a 6th-level spell slot. The effect must be used within 10 minutes of completing the tracing, or the rune’s power dissipates.GEBU
Generosity and hospitality, gifts
Benefit: Y ou have advantage on Intelligence 
checks to estimate an item’s value.Power: When you spend 1 minute carefully 
examining an item while tracing gebu on it, you learn the item’s name and magical properties, as if you had cast an identify spell. Alternatively, if you use an action to trace gebu on a willing creature, that creature gains the effect of a sanctuary spell. (Y ou can’t use this power on yourself.) The effect lasts while you concentrate, for up to 1 minute.
Mastery Power (8th level): T o use this power, you 
take an action to scratch or sketch gebu on a wall, floor, or other surface of an enclosed space, in a place where it is clearly visible. For up to 1 minute thereafter, you can activate the rune with a command word, provided you are within 20 feet of it. When you do so, each creature within 20 feet of the rune and with a clear line of sight to it (regardless of whether the creature can actually see it) must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, a creature is affected as if by a calm emotions spell that lasts while you concentrate, for up to 1 minute.


HAGALAZ
Hail, winter weather
Benefit: Y ou have advantage on Wisdom 
(Survival) checks to predict weather conditions for the next 24 hours in your vicinity.
Power: If you take an action to trace hagalaz on a willing 
creature, it receives the benefit of a protection from energy (cold) spell while you concentrate, for up to 1 hour.

on the ground under the open sky, you produce the effect 
of a sleet storm centered on a point you choose within 150 feet. Sketching the rune takes 4 rounds, and the storm lasts while you concentrate, for up to 2 minutes.
Mastery Power (14th level): When hagalaz is 
sketched on the ground inside the area of an effect caused by sleet storm, ice storm, control weather (hail or blizzard only), or a similar spell, the rune brings about a dispel magic effect as if that spell had been cast with a 7th-level slot. If the effect being dispelled is from 8th- or 9th-level magic, you use Charisma for the ability check to determine the rune’s effectiveness. Sketching the rune takes 2 rounds.
Mastery Power (14th level): When hagalaz is 
sketched on the ground inside the area of a natural (nonmagical) storm, the rune brings about the effect of a control weather spell. Sketching the rune takes 1 hour, and the control lasts while you concentrate, for up to 8 hours.

RUNE MAGICINGWAZ
Ancestors, major deities
Benefit: Y ou have proficiency on 
Intelligence (History) checks.

The iced area can have any shape you want, as long as every square of ice has at least one side in common with another square of ice; on a grid of 5-foot squares, the ice can cover as many as 9 squares. Ice-filled squares are difficult terrain, and the DC of Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks made in the area increases by 5. The ice is nonmagical and melts normally.
Power (5th level): When isaz is traced on a weapon,

SHADOW MAGICDarkness brings a tingle to the spine, reminding us of a 
time when we felt trapped without light and the darkness itself seemed a companion to fear.
When the light goes out, the hair on the back of your 
neck stands up. Was that the wind, or is something lurking in the dark, waiting to attack you? When nature’s deadliest predators hunt in darkness, their ability to see when we can’t makes us feel weak against their power.
Shadow magic can lend a sinister feel to an NPC, or 
cast a player character as a cursed hero who uses the power of darkness for good—at the cost of his or her soul. Spellcasters who manipulate shadow draw this mysterious, unsettling energy from alien dimensions  and turn it to their own uses.

Spell Descriptions
The following spells are presented in alphabetical order.


BECOME NIGHTWING
6th-level enchantment (shadow)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: SelfComponents: V , S, M (a crow’s eye)Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
This spell imbues you with wings of shadow. For the 
duration of the spell, you gain a flying speed of 60 feet and a new attack action: Nightwing Breath.
Nightwing Breath (Recharge 4–6). Y ou exhale 
shadow -substance in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in the 
area takes 5d6 necrotic damage, or half the damage with a 
successful Dexterity saving throw. BLACK HAND
4th-level necromancy (shadow)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 30 feetComponents: V , SDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute


Y ou gather the powers of darkness into your fist and fling
dark, paralyzing flame at a target within 30 feet. If you make a successful ranged spell attack, this spell siphons vitality from the target into you. For the duration, the target has disadvantage (and you have advantage) on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws made with Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution. An affected target makes a Constitution saving throw (with disadvantage) at the end of its turn, ending the effect on a success.


BLACK RIBBONS
1st-level conjuration (shadow)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 40 feetComponents: V , S, M (a piece of ribbon)Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute


Y ou pull pieces of the plane of shadow into your own
reality, causing a 20-foot cube to fill with inky ribbons that 
247


SHADOW MAGICturn the area into difficult terrain and wrap around nearby
creatures. Any creature that ends its turn in the area becomes restrained by the ribbons until the end of its next turn, unless it makes a successful Dexterity saving throw. Once a creature succeeds on this saving throw, it can’t be restrained again by the ribbons, but it’s still affected by the difficult terrain.


BLACK WELL
6th-level necromancy (shadow)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 300 feetComponents: V , SDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Y ou summon a seething sphere of dark energy 5 feet 
in diameter at a point within range. The sphere pulls creatures toward it and devours the life force of those it envelops. Every creature other than you that starts its turn within 90 feet of the black well must make a successful Strength saving throw or be pulled 50 feet toward the well. A creature pulled into the well takes 6d8 necrotic damage and is stunned; a successful Constitution saving throw halves the damage and causes the creature to become incapacitated. A creature that starts its turn inside the well also makes a Constitution saving throw; the creature is stunned on a failed save or incapacitated on a success. An incapacitated creature that leaves the well recovers immediately and can take actions and reactions on that turn. A creature takes damage only upon entering the well—it takes no additional damage for remaining there—but if it leaves the well and is pulled back in again, it takes damage again. A total of nine Medium creatures, three Large creatures, or one Huge creature can be inside the well’s otherdimensional space at one time. When the spell’s duration ends, all creatures inside it tumble out in a heap, landing prone.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 
spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage dealt by the well increases by 1d8—and the well pulls creatures an additional 5 feet—for each slot level above 6th.


CALL SHADOW MASTIFF
3rd-level conjuration (shadow)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 60 feetComponents: V , S, M (a dog’s tooth)Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Y ou conjure a shadow mastiff from the plane of shadow. 
This creature obeys your verbal commands to aid you in battle or to seek out a specific creature. It has the body of a large dog with a smooth black coat, 2 feet high at the shoulder and weighing 200 pounds.
The mastiff is friendly to you and your companions. Roll 
initiative for the mastiff; it acts on its own turn. It obeys simple, verbal commands from you, within its ability to act. Giving a command takes no action on your part.
The mastiff disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or 
when the spell ends.

Bay. When a shadow mastiff howls, all creatures within a 300-
foot radius who are not evil monstrosities must succeed on 
a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be panicked. On each of its turns, a panicked creature must take the Dash action and move away from the mastiff by the safest and shortest route, if such a route exists. If the target moves out of range of this ability, the effect ends.
Scent. Shadow mastiffs have advantage on all Wisdom checks 
that rely on their sense of smell.
Shadow Blend. Shadow mastiffs can hide in any condition of 
illumination other than bright light.
Trip. Whenever a shadow mastiff hits an opponent with a bite 
attack for the first time on a turn, the opponent falls prone unless it succeeds on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the shadow mastiff makes an immediate second bite attack as a bonus action.


ACTIONS

SHADOW MAGICCLOAK OF SHADOW
1st-level illusion (shadow)
Casting Time: 1 bonus actionRange: SelfComponents: VDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Y ou cloak yourself in shadow, giving you advantage 
on Dexterity (Stealth) checks against creatures that rely on sight.


CONJURE SHADOW TITAN
7th-level conjuration (shadow)
Casting Time: 1 minuteRange: 90 feetComponents: V , SDuration: Concentration, up to 1 hour
Y ou summon a shadow titan, which appears 
in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. The shadow titan’s statistics are identical to a stone giant’s, with two differences: its camouflage ability works in dim light instead of rocky terrain, and the “rocks” it hurls are composed of shadow-stuff and cause cold damage.


The shadow titan is friendly to you and your
companions. Roll initiative for the shadow titan; it acts on its own turn. It obeys verbal or telepathic commands that you issue to it (giving a command takes no action on your part). If you don’t issue any commands to the shadow titan, it defends itself from hostile creatures but otherwise takes no actions.


The shadow titan disappears when it drops
to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.


CREEPING DARKNESS
8th-level conjuration (shadow)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 60 feetComponents: V , SDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Y ou create a great, writhing mass of shadows that move 
slowly in a direction you choose. The grasping, shadowy tendrils occupy up to three 10-foot cubes within range. The mass has a speed of 20 feet, and it moves each round at the end of your turn, ignoring difficult terrain. The shadows can also move vertically or across a ceiling, as long as they can travel along a surface on which to cling. 
All light in this area is reduced to dim light. The surface 
covered by the darkness is considered difficult terrain.If the darkness moves into the space occupied by a living 
creature, that creature takes 6d6 necrotic damage and is restrained. The creature must make a Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the creature takes half the damage and is not restrained. Any creature in the area of the spell at the start of its turn must make another Constitution saving throw, taking damage in each round that it remains in the area. Restrained creatures move with the darkness, dragged along by the shadowy tendrils. A creature can take an action on its turn to make a Strength check against your spell save DC to free itself from the tendrils.
Bright light can destroy portions of the spell. One 5-foot 
cube is destroyed if it takes 12 radiant damage. As long as at least one 5-foot cube occupies all or part of a creature’s space, the creature remains restrained.

249


SHADOW MAGICDARK DEMENTING
5th-level illusion (shadow)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 120 feetComponents: V , S, M (a moonstone)Duration: 10 minutes
A dark shadow creeps across the target’s mind and leaves a 
small bit of shadow essence behind, triggering a profound fear of the dark. A creature you designate within range must make a Charisma saving throw. If it fails, the target becomes frightened of you for the duration. A frightened creature can repeat the saving throw each time it takes damage, ending the effect on a success. While frightened in this way, the creature will not willingly enter or attack into a space that isn’t brightly lit. If it’s in dim light or darkness, the creature must either move toward bright light or create its own (by lighting a lantern, casting a light 
spell, or the like).


DARK PATH
2nd-level conjuration (shadow)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 30 feetComponents: V , S, M (a lodestone)Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute


Y ou conjure a shadowy road between two points within
range to create a bridge or path. This effect can bridge a chasm or create a smooth path through difficult terrain. The dark path is 10 feet wide and up to 50 feet long. It can support up to 500 pounds of weight at one time. A creature that adds more weight than the path can support sinks through the path as if it didn’t exist.


DARKBOLT
2nd-level evocation (shadow)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 60 feetComponents: V , SDuration: Instantaneous


Y ou utter a quick invocation to create a black nimbus
around your hand, then hurl three rays of darkness at one or more targets in range. The rays can be divided between targets however you like. Make a ranged spell attack for each target (not each ray); each ray that hits deals 1d10 cold damage. A target that was hit by one or more rays must make a successful Constitution saving throw or be unable to use reactions until the start of its next turn.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell 
slot of 3rd level or higher, you create one additional ray for each slot level above 2nd.DOUSE LIGHT
Transmutation cantrip (shadow)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 30 feetComponents: V , SDuration: Instantaneous
With a simple gesture, you can put out a single small 
source of light within range. This spell extinguishes a torch, a candle, a lantern, or a light or dancing lights cantrip.


DYING OF THE LIGHT
7th-level evocation (shadow)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 120 feetComponents: V , S, M (a black pearl worth 250 gp)Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
A wave of withering darkness erupts from you, filling a 
120-foot-radius sphere and extinguishing any nonmagical light sources in the area. Any light produced by spells of 6th level or lower is dispelled. Magic items (but not artifacts) that give off light have that property suppressed while in the spell’s area. Any light sources brought into the area during the spell’s duration are likewise extinguished. Light-producing spells of 7th level or higher function within the area.


Nonmagical light sources removed from the area can be
reignited. Magic items regain their ability to give off light 1 round after leaving the area. This magical darkness foils darkvision, except for creatures that can see in magical darkness, such as devils. Y ou can see within the area of the spell as if it were brightly lit.


Each creature you choose to be affected that ends its
turn in the darkness takes 4d8 necrotic damage and gains one level of exhaustion. A successful Constitution saving throw halves the damage and negates the exhaustion. 
HIDE IN ONE’S SHADOW
4th-level transmutation (shadow)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: T ouchComponents: S, M (charcoal)Duration: 3 hours


When you touch a willing creature with a piece of charcoal
while casting this spell, the target and everything it carries blends into and becomes part of the target’s shadow, which remains discernible, although its body seems to disappear. The shadow is incorporeal, has no weight, and is immune to all but psychic and radiant damage. The target remains aware of its surroundings and can move, but only as a shadow could move—flowing along surfaces as if the 
250
SHADOW MAGICcreature were moving normally. The creature can step out 
of the shadow at will, resuming its physical shape in the shadow’s space and ending the spell. 
This spell cannot be cast in an area devoid of light, where 
a shadow would not normally appear. Even a faint light source, such as moonlight or starlight, is sufficient. If that light source is removed, or if the shadow is flooded with light in such a way that the physical creature wouldn’t cast a shadow, the spell ends and the creature reappears in the shadow’s space.


LEGION
3rd-level conjuration (shadow)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 60 feetComponents: V , S, M (a toy soldier)Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Y ou call down a legion of shadowy soldiers in a 10-foot 
cube. Their features resemble a mockery of once-living creatures. Whenever a creature starts its turn inside the cube or within 5 feet of it, or enters the cube for the first time on its turn, the conjured shades make an attack using your melee spell attack modifier; on a hit, the target takes 3d8 necrotic damage. The space inside the cube is difficult terrain.


NEGATIVE IMAGE
2nd-level conjuration (shadow)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 120 feetComponents: V , S, M (a piece of reflective obsidian)Duration: Instantaneous


Y ou create a shadow-tunnel between your location and
one other creature you can see within range. Y ou and that creature instantly swap positions. If the target creature is unwilling to exchange places with you, it can resist the effect by making a Charisma saving throw. On a successful save, the spell has no effect.


SHADOW ARMOR
1st-level abjuration (shadow)
Casting Time: 1 reaction, which you take when you are 
targeted by an attack but before the roll is made
Range: SelfComponents: V , SDuration: Instantaneous


Y ou can siphon energy from the plane of shadow to
protect yourself from an immediate threat. As a reaction, you pull shadows around yourself to distort reality. The attack against you is made with disadvantage, and you have resistance to radiant damage until the start of your next turn.


SHADOW BITE
Illusion cantrip (shadow)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 60 feetComponents: V , SDuration: Instantaneous
Y ou create a momentary needle of cold, sharp pain in a 
creature within range. The target must make a successful Constitution saving throw or take 1d6 necrotic damage immediately and have its speed halved until the start of your next turn.
This spell’s damage increases to 2d6 when you reach 5th 
level, 3d6 when you reach 11th level, and 4d6 when you reach 17th level.


SHADOW BLINDNESS
Illusion cantrip (shadow)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: T ouchComponents: V , SDuration: 1 round


Y ou make a melee spell attack against a creature you
touch that has darkvision as an innate ability; on a hit, the 
target’s darkvision is negated until the spell ends. This spell has no effect against darkvision that derives from a spell or 
a magic item. The target retains all of its other senses .


SHADOW GATEWAY
5th-level conjuration (ritual) (shadow)
Casting Time: 1o minutesRange: 30 feetComponents: V , S, M (a piece of black chalk)Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
By drawing a circle of black chalk up to 15 feet in diameter 
and chanting for one minute during the casting time, you open a portal directly into the Plane of Shadow. The portal fills the chalk circle and appears as a vortex of inky blackness; nothing can be seen through it. Any object or creature that passes through the portal instantly arrives safely at the destination. The portal remains open for 1 minute or until you stop concentrating on the spell, and it can be used to travel between the Plane of Shadow and the chalk circle, in both directions, as many times as desired during the spell’s duration.

SHADOW MAGICSHADOW HANDS
1st-level evocation (shadow)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: Self (10-foot cone)Components: V , SDuration: Instantaneous


A freezing blast of shadow explodes out from you in a
10-foot cone. Any creature caught in the shadow takes 2d4 necrotic damage and is frightened; a successful Wisdom saving throw halves the damage and negates the frightened condition.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage dealt by the attack increases by 2d4 for each slot level above 1st.


SHADOW METAMORPHOSIS
6th-level transmutation (shadow)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: T ouchComponents: V , SDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Y ou touch a creature of Huge size or smaller, or a single 
object no more than 20 feet in any dimension, and transform it into malleable shadow-stuff. Objects under the effect of the spell are not immaterial, but are easy to shape or compress. One could not walk through a door that is affected by the spell, but the door could be pulled aside like a curtain and bypassed, or pulled up like the bottom edge of a tent flap and crawled under, even if the door was locked.


An unwilling creature can make a Constitution saving
throw, avoiding the effect on a success. A creature under the effect of the spell is amorphous and can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing. In dim light or darkness, the creature has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks. A creature under the effect of this spell cannot make attacks or cast spells and has vulnerability to radiant damage.


SHADOW MONSTERS
4th-level illusion (shadow)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 120 feetComponents: V , S, M (a doll)Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Y ou choose up to two creatures within range. Each 
creature must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature perceives its allies as hostile, shadowy monsters, and it must attack its nearest ally. An affected creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using 
a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 4th.


SHADOW PUPPETS
2nd-level illusion (shadow)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 60 feetComponents: V , S, M (a pinch of powdered lead)Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Y ou animate the shadow of a creature within range, 
causing it to attack that creature. As a bonus action when you cast the spell, or as an action on subsequent rounds while you maintain concentration, make a melee spell attack against the creature. If it hits, the target takes 2d8 psychic damage and must make a successful Intelligence saving throw or be incapacitated until the start of your next turn.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 
spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.


SHADOW STEP
4th-level conjuration (shadow)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 60 feetComponents: V , SDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute


Y ou can open a temporary portal between two darkened
areas, allowing you to move from one such area to another without crossing the intervening space. If you start your turn in an area of dim light or darkness, you can open a portal to another area of dim light or darkness within range and transport yourself to that spot. Doing this uses up your movement for the turn, regardless of the distance traveled. Y ou can use shadow step while prone. Moving in this manner does not draw opportunity attacks.


SHADOW TENDRILS
3rd-level necromancy (shadow)
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 30 feetComponents: V , SDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute


Writhing ribbons of quasi-real darkness extend from your

252
SHADOW MAGICthe target takes 2d8 cold damage and must succeed at a 
Dexterity saving throw or be restrained.

tendrils takes the cold damage again. It can take an action to make a Dexterity check against your spell save DC to free itself. On your turn, as a bonus action, you can drag a creature restrained by the shadow tendrils up to 15 feet closer to you.
The tendrils have AC 13 and 12 hit points. They are 
immune to bludgeoning damage and to piercing and slashing damage from nonmagical weapons. They are vulnerable to radiant damage. If the tendrils are destroyed by damage but the spell is still in effect, you can re-form them on your turn as a bonus action.


SHADOW TROVE
3rd-level transmutation (ritual) (shadow)
Casting Time: 1 minuteRange: 5 feetComponents: V , S, M (ink made from the blood of  
a raven)
Duration: 1 hour
Y ou paint a small door approximately 2 feet square on a 
hard surface to create a portal into the void of space. The portal “peels off ” the surface you painted it on and follows you when you move, always floating in the air within 5 feet of you. An icy chill flows out from the portal. Y ou can place up to 750 pounds of nonliving matter in the portal, where it stays suspended in the frigid void until you withdraw it. Items that are still inside the shadow trove when the duration ends spill out onto the ground. Y ou can designate a number of creatures up to your Intelligence modifier who have access to the shadow trove; only you and those creatures can move objects into the portal.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 
spell slot of 4th level or higher, the duration increases by 2 hours for each slot level above 3rd.


SILHOUETTE
Illusion cantrip (shadow)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: T ouchComponents: V , SDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Y ou create a shadow play against a screen or wall. The 
surface can encompass up to 100 square feet. The number of creatures that can see the shadow play equals your Intelligence score. The shadowy figures make no sound but they can dance, run, move, kiss, fight, and so forth. Most of the figures are generic types—a rabbit, a dwarf—but a number of them equal to your Intelligence modifier can be recognizable as specific individuals.


SLITHER
2nd-level transmutation (shadow)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: SelfComponents: V , M (ashes from a wooden statue of you, 
made into ink and used to draw your portrait, worth  
50 gp)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Y ou momentarily become a shadow (a humanoid-
shaped absence of light, not the undead creature of that name). Y ou can slide under a door, through a keyhole, or through any other tiny opening. All of your equipment is transformed with you, and you can move up to your full speed during the spell’s duration. While in this form, you have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made in darkness or dim light and you are immune to nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. Y ou can dismiss this spell by using an action to do so.


If you return to your normal form while in a space too
small for you (such as a mouse hole, sewer pipe, or the like), you take 4d6 force damage and are pushed to the nearest space within 50 feet big enough to hold you. If the distance is greater than 50 feet, you take an extra 1d6 force damage for every additional 10 feet traveled.
At Higher Levels.


When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target an 
additional willing creature that you touch for each slot level above 2nd.


UMBRAL STORM
9th-level necromancy (shadow)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 120 feetComponents: V , SDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute


Y ou create a channel to a region of the Plane of Shadow
that is inimical to life and order. A storm of dark, raging entropy fills a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you can see within range. Any creature that starts its turn in the storm or enters it for the first time on its turn takes 6d8 necrotic damage and gains one level of exhaustion; a successful Constitution saving throw halves the damage and prevents the exhaustion.


Y ou can use a bonus action on your turn to move the area
of the storm 30 feet in any direction.
253


SHADOW MAGICShadow Bloodline
Y our magic comes from a place drained of color, 
where light fights a losing battle against the relentless encroachment of darkness.


SORCEROUS ORIGIN
In the distant past, your ancestors were touched by shadow 
magic, and it has left its mark on your family bloodline.


TAINT OF SHADOW
Y our magic always acts a bit differently from that of other casters. Y our magical fire burns with a deep purple flame that sheds little light but casts inky shadows. The influence of shadow magic can be seen in every manifestation of your work, whether it takes the form of shadowy bonds tightening 
around the target of a hold person spell or the 
shadows that swirl like storm clouds inside your dimension door. When you choose this origin at 1st level, you gain darkvision out to 60 feet. Within that range, you can see in magical darkness as if it were dim light.


EVIL EYE
Also starting at 1st level, you can gaze at one creature within 60 feet of you and by using a bonus action, you mark that creature with darkness. The marked creature has disadvantage on its next attack roll or skill check involving sight, unless it makes a successful Charisma 
saving throw. Y ou can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1). Y ou regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.


DARK ILLUSIONS
Starting at 6th level, you have advantage on saving throws against illusion magic. Y ou can also cast blur or mirror image by spending 2 sorcery points.


PASSAGE THROUGH THE DARK
At 14th level, you gain the ability to traverse between patches of darkness. When the area you occupy is lightly or heavily 
obscured, you can use a bonus action to step 
through a shadow and emerge from another shadow up to 
200 feet away. Y ou can stay inside the shadow connection 
for a number of rounds equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1)
; while there, you are invisible, nothing can 
affect you, and you can’t affect anything else. Each use of this ability costs you 4 sorcery points.


TAINTED SHADOWS
Beginning at 18th level, by spending 4 sorcery points, you radiate an aura of shadow that causes everything within 15 feet of you to become lightly obscured because of dim lighting. Any portion of that area that’s already dimly lit becomes dark instead. An enemy that starts its turn inside this aura takes 10 necrotic damage and must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened. The effect lasts until the start of your next turn.
254


TEMPORAL MAGIC
The control and manipulation of time is an esoteric 
and mysterious branch of magic. Spellcasters who seek to alter time have the potential to perform incredible deeds. That potential is tempered by the great danger of intervening with time, which resists mortal interference. Many gods, too, look unfavorably on those who try to divert or dam the currents of time, and their disfavor should never be taken lightly.TEMPORAL MAGIC SPELL LISTS
Esoteric though it may be, the knowledge of how to 
manipulate time through magic is not the province of certain types of spellcasters. Anyone, even paladins, can amass a repertoire of these spells sufficient to attract the attention of a higher power.


Several temporal spells are also classified as clockwork
magic. For ease of reference, those entries in the lists carry a “[clockwork]” identifier.

within 30 feet of yourself. Y ou can choose to deliver either a haste  or slow effect (as the spell) to each creature in the 
area. An unwilling creature makes a Constitution saving throw, avoiding the effect on a success. Each unwilling creature must make a new saving throw if it remains in the affected area at the end of its turn. Any affected creature returns to normal if it exits the area, but if a creature reenters the area while the spell is still active, it is subject to the effect of the spell (and receives another saving throw, if unwilling).4TH LEVEL

TEMPORAL MAGICANTICIPATE ARCANA
3rd-level divination (temporal)
Casting Time: 1 reaction, which you take when an 
enemy you can see casts a spell
Range: SelfComponents: V , SDuration: Instantaneous

against a magical attack. When you cast anticipate arcana, you have advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects until the start of your next turn.


ANTICIPATE ATTACK
2nd-level divination (temporal)
Casting Time: 1 reaction, which you take when you are 
attacked but before the attack roll is made
Range: SelfComponents: V , SDuration: Instantaneous
In a flash of foreknowledge, you spot an oncoming attack 
with enough time to avoid it. Upon casting this spell, you can move up to half your speed without provoking opportunity attacks. The oncoming attack still occurs but misses automatically if you are no longer within the attack’s range, are in a space that's impossible for the attack to hit, or can’t be targeted by that attack in your new position. If none of those circumstances apply but the situation has changed—you have moved into a position where you have cover, for example—then the attack is made after taking the new situation into account.


ANTICIPATE WEAKNESS
1st-level divination (temporal)
Casting Time: 1 bonus actionRange: SelfComponents: V , SDuration: Instantaneous
With a quick glance into the future, you pinpoint where 
a gap is about to open in your foe’s defense, and then you strike. After casting anticipate weakness, you have advantage 
on attack rolls until the end of your turn.AUSPICIOUS WARNING
1st-level enchantment (temporal)
Casting Time: 1 reaction, which you take when an ally 
makes an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw
Range: 30 feetComponents: VDuration: Instantaneous
Just in time, you call out a fortunate warning to a creature 
within range. The target rolls a d4 and adds the number rolled to an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw that it has just made and uses the new result for determining success or failure.


CHRONAL LANCE
1st-level transmutation (temporal) (clockwork)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 60 feetComponents: V , SDuration: 1 minute


Y ou inflict the ravages of aging on up to three creatures
within range, temporarily discomfiting them and making them appear elderly for a time. Each target must make a successful Wisdom saving throw, or its walking speed is halved (round up to the nearest 5-foot increment) and it has disadvantage on Dexterity checks (but not saving throws). An affected creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using 
a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 1st.


DECELERATE
2nd-level transmutation (temporal)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 60 feetComponents: V , S, M (a toy top)Duration: 1 minute


Y ou slow the flow of time around a creature within range
that you can see. The creature must make a successful Wisdom saving throw, or its walking speed is halved (round up to the nearest 5-foot increment). The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. Until the spell ends, on a failed save the target’s speed is halved again at the start of each of your turns. For example, if a creature with a speed of 30 feet fails its initial saving throw, its speed drops to 15 feet. At the start of your next turn, the creature’s speed drops to 10 feet on a failed save, then to 5 feet on the 
259
TEMPORAL MAGICfollowing round on another failed save. Decelerate can’t 
reduce a creature’s speed to less than 5 feet.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 
spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can affect an additional creature for each slot level above 2nd.


FLICKERING FATE
4th-level divination (temporal)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: T ouchComponents: V , SDuration: 1 round


Y ou or a creature that you touch can see a few seconds
into the future. When the spell is cast, each other creature within 30 feet of the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. Those that fail must declare, in initiative order, what their next action will be. The target of the spell declares his or her action last, after hearing what all other creatures will do. Each creature that declared an action must follow its declaration as closely as possible when its turn comes. For the duration of the spell, the target has advantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws, and creatures that declared their actions have disadvantage on attack rolls against the target.


FORETELL DISTRACTION
1st-level divination (temporal)
Casting Time: 1 bonus actionRange: SelfComponents: SDuration: Instantaneous
Thanks to your foreknowledge, you know exactly when 
your foe will take his or her eyes off you. Casting this spell has the same effect as making a successful Dexterity (Stealth) check, provided cover or concealment is available within 10 feet of you. It doesn’t matter whether enemies can see you when you cast the spell; they glance away at just the right moment. Y ou can move up to 10 feet as part of casting the spell, provided you’re able to move (not restrained or grappled or reduced to a speed of less than 10 feet for any other reason). This move doesn’t count as part of your normal movement. After the spell is cast, you must be in a position where you can remain hidden: a lightly obscured space, for example, or a space where you have total cover. Otherwise, enemies see you again immediately and you’re not hidden.QUICKEN
Transmutation cantrip (temporal)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: T ouchComponents: V , SDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Y ou touch one willing creature. Once before the duration 
of the spell expires, the target can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to an initiative roll or Dexterity saving throw it has just made. The spell then ends.


QUICK TIME
4th-level conjuration (temporal)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 30 feetComponents: V , S, M (any seed)Duration: Instantaneous


Y ou make one living creature or plant within range move
rapidly in time compared to you. The target becomes one year older. For example, you could cast this spell on a seedling, which causes the plant to sprout from the soil, or you could cast this spell on a newly hatched duckling, causing it to become a full-grown duck. If the target is a creature with an Intelligence of 3 or higher, it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw to resist the aging. It can choose to fail the saving throw. 
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 
spell slot of 5th level or higher, you increase the target’s age by one additional year for each slot level above 4th.


RAVAGES OF TIME
7th-level transmutation (temporal)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 60 feetComponents: V , S, M (a wilted flower)Duration: 24 hours
Y ou accelerate the aging of one creature within range, 
causing it to take on the state of a decrepit version of its type. The target suffers three levels of exhaustion that cannot be removed by normal means. A greater restoration spell partially reverses the effect of this spell, removing one level of exhaustion. Constructs and undead are unaffected by this spell, and creatures who live to great age without negative effects, such as dragons, are also unaffected.

your conjurations with cosmic potency.

SCRY AMBUSH
4th-level divination (temporal)
Casting Time: 1 reaction, which you take when an 
enemy tries to make a surprise attack against you
Range: SelfComponents: V , SDuration: Instantaneous
Y ou foresee your foe’s strike a split second before it occurs. 
When you cast this spell successfully, you also designate a number of your allies that can see or hear you equal to your spellcasting ability modifier + your proficiency bonus. Those allies are also not surprised by the attack and can act normally in the first round of combat. 
If you would be surprised, you must make a check using 
your spellcasting ability at the moment your reaction would be triggered. The check DC is equal to the current initiative count. On a failed check, you are surprised and can’t use your reaction to cast this spell until after your next turn. On a successful check, you can use your reaction to cast this spell immediately.
SEER’S REACTION
1st-level divination (temporal)
Casting Time: 1 reaction, which you take at the start of 
another creature’s turn
Range: SelfComponents: V , SDuration: Instantaneous

because you knew what was going to happen. When you cast this spell, make a new initiative roll with a +5 bonus. If the result is higher than your current initiative, your place in the initiative order changes accordingly. If the result is also higher than the current place in the initiative order, you take your next turn immediately and then use the higher number starting in the next round.


TIME IN A BOTTLE
9th-level transmutation (temporal) (clockwork)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: SightComponents: VDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Y ou designate a spot within your sight. Time comes under 
your control in a 20-foot radius centered on that spot. Y ou can freeze it, reverse it, or move it forward by as much as 1 minute as long as you maintain concentration. Nothing and no one, yourself included, can enter the field or affect what happens inside it. Y ou can choose to end the effect at any moment as an action on your turn.


TIME JAUNT
7th-level transmutation (temporal)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: SelfComponents: VDuration: Special
When you cast this spell, you step outside the normal time 
stream, seeming to vanish as 1 round of time passes. Y ou can make minor alterations to the scene being played out, becoming visible for an instant each time you make an adjustment that aids an ally or hinders foes. T o everyone else, you disappear when the spell is cast, then flicker into and out of view during the next round, before reappearing for good in the space you vanished from 1 round later, whereupon the spell ends. Y ou cannot be attacked by any means while under the effect of this spell.
261
TEMPORAL MAGICAs the round progresses, you can choose to bestow a 
single effect on each creature involved in the combat, 
choosing from the list below. Y ou cannot take any other actions during the round. 
• Give a creature advantage or disadvantage on a saving throw it is about to make.
• Give a creature advantage or disadvantage on an attack roll it is about to make.
• Alter the location of a mobile object to provide or remove cover for a creature.
• Shift objects into the path of a creature; the first 10 feet of terrain it must travel becomes difficult terrain.
• After an attack roll is determined to be successful, adjust the angle of the strike or the positioning of the target, either causing the strike to deal half as much damage or providing a bonus to damage equal to half your level.
Example of Combat. An adventuring party encounters four trolls in their lair. Initiative is rolled, and the order is fighter 20, cleric 15, rogue 14, trolls 12, wizard 10. Events unfold in this way:
Fighter draws sword and attacks troll #1.
Cleric casts time jaunt and disappears.Rogue fires an arrow at troll #2. Cleric yanks the troll’s 
arm, turning it broadside for a better target and giving the 
rogue advantage on the attack roll. The attack hits.
T roll #1 swings at the fighter. Cleric gives the fighter’s 
shield a nudge to raise it just a little faster. T roll has disadvantage on the attack roll and misses.
T roll #2 throws a spear at the rogue. Cleric flips a table 
over between the rogue and the troll, giving the rogue cover against the attack. Attack roll is still high enough to hit
.
T roll #3 charges the fighter. Cleric tips over an open 
barrel of pickled herring, strewing the contents across the floor and making the first 10 feet in the troll’s path difficult terrain. As a result, troll #3 does not have enough movement to reach the fighter on its turn.
T roll #4 moves and attacks the fighter, scoring a hit. 
Cleric pulls on the troll’s weapon arm so the strike is a glancing one rather than a direct hit, and the attack deals half as much damage.
Wizard casts grease on the area where trolls #1 and #4 
are standing. Cleric gives each a swift kick to the back of the knee. T rolls have disadvantage on their Dexterity saving throws, fail their saves, and fall prone.
Fighter stabs at troll #1, scoring a hit. Cleric gives the 
troll’s arm a yank, moving it just enough that the fighter hits the monster’s chest rather than its shoulder, providing the fighter a bonus of +7 (half the cleric’s level) on the attack’s damage.Cleric pops back into view, occupying the space where 
time jaunt was cast, then takes the next turn in round 2 as normal.


TIME JUMP
8th-level transmutation (temporal) (clockwork)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: T ouchComponents: V , SDuration: Instantaneous


Y ou touch a construct and throw it forward in time if it
fails a Constitution saving throw. The construct disappears for 1d4 + 1 rounds, during which time it cannot act or be acted upon in any way. When the construct returns, it is unaware that any time has passed.


TIME LOOP
6th-level transmutation (temporal)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 30 feetComponents: V , S, M (a metal loop)Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Y ou capture a creature within range in a loop of time. 
The target is teleported to the space where it began its most recent turn. The target then makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the spell ends. On a failed save, the creature must repeat the activities it undertook on its previous turn, following the sequence of moves and actions to the best of its ability. It doesn’t need to move along the same path or attack the same target, but if it moved and then attacked on its previous turn, its only option is to move and then attack on this turn. If the space where the target began its previous turn is occupied or if it’s impossible for the target to take the same action (if it cast a spell but is now unable to do so, for example), the target becomes incapacitated.


An affected target can repeat the saving throw at the end
of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. For as long as the spell lasts, the target teleports back to its starting point at the start of each of its turns, and it must repeat the same sequence of moves and actions.
262


TEMPORAL MAGICTIME SLIPPAGE
8th-level enchantment (temporal) (clockwork)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 60 feetComponents: V , S, M (the heart of a chaotic creature of 
challenge rating 5 or higher, worth 500 gp)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Y ou ensnare a creature within range in an insidious trap, 
causing different parts of its body to function at different speeds. The creature must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, it is stunned until the end of its next turn. On a success, the creature’s speed is halved and it has disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws until the end of its next turn. The creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, with the same effects for success and failure. In addition, the creature has disadvantage on Strength or Dexterity saving throws but advantage on Constitution or Charisma saving throws for the spell’s duration (a side effect of the chronal anomaly suffusing its body). The spell ends if the creature makes three successful saves in a row.TIME STEP
2nd-level conjuration (temporal)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: SelfComponents: VDuration: Instantaneous
Y ou briefly step forward in time. Y ou disappear from your 
location and reappear at the start of your next turn in a location of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of the space you disappeared from. Y ou can’t be affected by anything that happens during the time you’re missing, and you aren’t aware of anything that happens during that time.


TIME VORTEX
4th-level evocation (temporal)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 90 feetComponents: V , SDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
This spell destabilizes the flow of time, enabling you to 
create a vortex of temporal fluctuations that are visible 

263
TEMPORAL MAGICas a spherical distortion with a 10-foot radius, centered 
on a point within range. Each creature in the area when you cast the spell must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be affected by the time vortex. While the spell lasts, a creature that enters the sphere or starts its turn inside the sphere must also succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be affected. On a succesful save, it becomes immune to this casting of the spell.
An affected creature can’t take reactions and rolls a d10 at 
the start of its turn to determine its behavior for that turn.
D10 EFFECT
1–2 The creature is affected as if by a slow spell until the start of its next turn.
3–5 The creature is stunned until the start of its next turn.
6–8 The creature’s current initiative result is reduced by 5. The creature begins using this new initiative result in the next round. Multiple occurrences of this effect for the same creature are cumulative.
9–10 The creature’s speed is halved (round up to the nearest 5-foot increment) until the start of its next turn.
Y ou can move the temporal vortex 10 feet each round as a bonus action. An affected creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell 
slot of 5th level or higher, the radius of the sphere increases by 5 feet for each slot level above 4th.


WALL OF TIME
5th-level abjuration (temporal)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 120 feetComponents: V , S, M (an hourglass)Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Y ou create a wall of shimmering, transparent blocks on 
a solid surface within range. Y ou can make a straight wall up to 60 feet long, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick, or a cylindrical wall up to 20 feet high, 1 foot thick, and 20 feet in diameter. Nonmagical ranged attacks that cross the wall vanish into the time stream with no other effect. Ranged spell attacks and ranged weapon attacks made with magic weapons that pass through the wall are made with disadvantage. A creature that intentionally enters or passes through the wall is affected as if it had just failed its initial saving throw against a slow spell.TIMEKEEPER
For those who understand its secrets, the flow of time itself is a powerful source of magical power.


WIZARD SPECIALTY
Wizards who strive to master temporal magic view seconds and minutes not merely as a way to measure life span, but as a way of manifesting great and mysterious power.
How to Start: If you’re a wizard who wants to become 
a timekeeper, you make that decision upon reaching 2nd level, when you are also entitled to choose an arcane tradition. If you decide to follow the path of the timekeeper exclusively, you can forego the selection of an arcane tradition and gain the features of the timekeeper specialty instead.


Y ou can also pursue the timekeeper specialty in
conjunction with one of the standard arcane traditions. If you choose to do this, you gain the Savant feature of your chosen school in addition to T emporal Magic Savant (described below). Also at 2nd level, you choose whether to gain the T emporal Points feature (see below) or the 2nd-level feature of your chosen school. Thereafter, at 6th, 10th, and 14th level, you choose between the lowest-level features still available. For instance, an abjurer might select Arcane Ward at 2nd level and T emporal Points at 6th level, followed by either Projected Ward or Extended Magic at 10th level.


TEMPORAL MAGIC SAVANT
Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and time you must spend to copy a temporal spell into your spellbook is halved.


TEMPORAL POINTS
Starting at 2nd level, you gain access to temporal points, which you can spend to acquire benefits. Y ou receive 2 temporal points at 2nd level, and you gain 1 additional point every time you gain a level, to a maximum of 20 points at 20th level. Y ou regain all spent temporal points when you finish a long rest. 
Y ou can spend 1 temporal point as a reaction or a bonus 
action on your turn to gain one of the following effects for 1 round:
• Y ou can use a bonus action on your next turn to take the Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object action.
• Y our Armor Class increases by 2.
• Y ou have advantage on the next Dexterity check you make.
Optionally, you can spend 2 temporal points as a bonus action on your turn to grant a creature you touch one of the listed effects for 1 round.
264


TEMPORAL MAGIC
EXTENDED MAGIC
Beginning at 6th level, when you cast a spell whose 
duration is 1 minute or longer, you can spend 1 temporal point to double the spell’s duration, to a maximum of  24 hours.


HASTENED
At 10th level, you add the haste  spell to your spellbook, if 
you don’t have it already. From now on, you never suffer the negative aftereffects of the haste  spell and can act 
normally when the spell ends.
Also, you can cast haste  on yourself without expending a 
spell slot. Once you cast haste  in this way, you can’t do so 
again until you finish a short or long rest. Y ou can still cast it normally using an available spell slot.


TIME MASTERY
Starting at 14th level, you can choose to ignore the effect of a temporal spell that would otherwise affect you. For instance, you can exempt yourself from the effect of a slow spell cast in the area you occupy. Or, if you would be affected by a quick time spell, you can choose to automatically succeed on the saving throw. 
Also, you can spend temporal points in the 
following ways.
• When you cast a spell with a casting time of 1 action, you can spend 2 temporal points to change the casting time for this casting to 1 bonus action.
• When you must make a saving throw against a temporal spell, you can spend 2 temporal points to succeed on the saving throw automatically. Y ou can make the decision to spend the points after rolling the d20 and seeing the result.• As a reaction when another creature casts time stop, you can spend 5 temporal points to gain the ability to act during the spell’s duration. Y ou and the spell’s caster alternate taking turns, with the caster acting first. Y ou have the same restrictions as the caster. If the caster ends the spell, it ends for everyone; if you take an action that ends the spell, it ends only for you, not for the caster.

WINTER MAGIC
Winter has considerable power, regardless of how it 
presents itself. In its most obvious manifestation, it is snow and ice driven by howling wind that reduces visibility to zero and covers everything in a frozen shell. Just as dangerous as this overt display of power is winter’s deceptively beautiful form, when an ineffective sun shines brightly on a serene tableau of glistening trees and smooth, powder-coated landscapes. Those who travel unprepared through this misleading peacefulness are liable to end up blinded or frozen.Winter Magic Spell Lists

Spell Descriptions
The following spells are presented in alphabetical order.


BITING ARROW
Evocation cantrip (winter)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: SelfComponents: V , M (an arrow or a thrown weapon)Duration: 1 round
As part of the action used to cast this spell, you make 
a ranged weapon attack with a bow, a crossbow, or a thrown weapon. The effect is limited to a range of 120 feet despite the weapon’s range, and the attack is made with disadvantage if the target is in the weapon’s long range.
If the weapon attack hits, it deals damage as usual. In 
addition, the target becomes coated in thin frost until the start of your next turn. If the target uses its reaction before the start of your next turn, it immediately takes 1d6 cold damage and the spell ends.The spell’s damage, for both the ranged attack and the 
cold damage, increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (+1d6 and 2d6), 11th level (+2d6 and 3d6), and 17th level (+3d6 and 4d6).


BLIZZARD
7th-level conjuration (winter)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 100 feetComponents: V , SDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute


A howling storm of thick snow and ice crystals appears
in a cylinder 40 feet high and 40 feet in diameter within range. The area is heavily obscured by the swirling snow. When the storm appears, each creature in the area takes 8d8 cold damage, or half as much damage with a successful Constitution saving throw. A creature also makes this saving throw and takes damage when it enters the area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. In addition, a creature that takes cold damage from this spell has disadvantage on Constitution saving throws to maintain concentration until the start of its next turn.
269
WINTER MAGICBOREAS’S BREATH
2nd-level transmutation (ritual) (winter)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: SelfComponents: V , SDuration: Instantaneous
You freeze standing water in a 20-foot cube or running 
water in a 10-foot cube centered on you. The water turns 
to solid ice. The surface becomes difficult terrain, and any creature that ends its turn on the ice must make a successful DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall prone.


Creatures that are partially submerged in the water when
it freezes become restrained. While restrained in this way, a creature takes 1d6 cold damage at the end of its turn. It can break free by using an action to make a successful Strength check against your spell save DC.


Creatures that are fully submerged in the water when it
freezes become incapacitated and cannot breathe. While incapacitated in this way, a creature takes 2d6 cold damage at the end of its turn. A trapped creature makes a DC 20 Strength saving throw after taking this damage at the end of its turn, breaking free from the ice on a success.
The ice has AC 10 and 15 hit points. It is vulnerable to 
fire damage, has resistance to nonmagical slashing and piercing damage, and is immune to cold, necrotic, poison, 
psychic, and thunder damage.
At Higher Levels.


When you cast this spell using a spell
slot of 3rd level or higher, the size of the cube increases by 
10 feet for each slot level abo ve 2nd.


BREATHTAKING WIND
1st-level evocation (winter)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 30 feetComponents: V , SDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Y ou target a creature with a blast of wintry air. That 
creature must make a successful Constitution saving throw or become unable to speak or cast spells with a vocal 
component for the duration of the spell.


BRITTLING
4th-level transmutation (winter)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: T ouchComponents: V , S, M (an icicle)Duration: Instantaneous


This spell uses biting cold to make a metal or stone object
you touch become brittle and more easily shattered. The object’s hit points are reduced by a number equal to your level as a spellcaster, and Strength checks to shatter or break the object are made with advantage if they occur within 1 minute of the spell’s casting. If the object isn’t shattered during this time, it reverts to the state it was in 
before the spell was cast.


CLASH OF GLACIERS
5th-level evocation (winter)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: Self (100-foot line)Components: V , S, M (a piece of cracked glass)Duration: Instantaneous


Y ou conjure up icy boulders that crush creatures in a
line 100 feet long. Each creature in the area takes 5d6 bludgeoning damage plus 5d6 cold damage, or half the damage with a successful Dexterity saving throw.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 
spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 5th. Y ou decide whether each extra die deals bludgeoning or cold damage.


CONTROL ICE
5th-level transmutation
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 300 feetComponents: V , S, M (a cube of white wax)Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Unt il the spell ends, you control any ice inside an area you 
choose within range that can be as large as a cube 100 feet 
on a side. Y ou choose one of the following three effects when you cast this spell. As an action on each of your turns thereafter, you can use the same effect or choose a different one. Any alterations made to the ice remain after the spell ends, but can be altered by other effects (temperature, seismic action, or another application of this spell, for example).
Crack . Y ou cause ice in the area to crack and splinter. 
On level terrain, this effect turns the ice into difficult terrain, possibly producing other hazards, depending on the terrain and the nature of the ice—ice over a deep chasm might open onto a pit, while ice over water can break into individual floes, for example. Using this effect on cliffs, walls, or ceilings made of ice can cause collapse, dealing 4d10 bludgeoning damage to creatures in the area below the collapse, or half the damage with a successful Dexterity saving throw. After such a collapse, the area where the fallen ice collects becomes difficult terrain.
Reshape. Y ou cause ice in a portion of the area to 
rapidly melt, move, and re-form into whatever shape 
you command. Y ou can block holes, open tunnels, form 
bridges, remove difficult terrain, or otherwise alter the 
270
WINTER MAGICform of the ice in the area. Y ou can cause ice to become 
slippery, making it difficult terrain, or dry to remove difficult terrain. Y ou can fill a hole up to a 20-foot cube, or create 20 feet (up to 20 feet wide) of a bridge across a chasm, or raise a 20-foot-tall pillar of ice (up to 20 feet square). Y ou can continue this action on consecutive rounds to increase the size of the affected area while you maintain concentration on the spell.
Thicken/Thin. Y ou cause existing ice to increase or 
decrease in thickness, up to 1 inch per round over some or all of the total area, either making the surface stronger or creating thin ice that is hazardous to walk on.


CREEPING ICE
2nd-level conjuration (winter)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 60 feetComponents: V , SDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Y ou create a sheet of ice that covers a 5-foot square within 
range and lasts for the spell’s duration. The iced area is difficult terrain.


A creature in the area where you cast the spell must make
a successful Strength saving throw or be restrained by ice that rapidly encases it. A creature restrained by the ice takes 2d6 cold damage at the start of its turn. A restrained creature can use an action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC, freeing itself on a success, but it has disadvantage on this check. The creature can also be freed (and the spell ended) by dealing at least 20 damage to the ice. The restrained creature takes half the damage from any attacks against the ice.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 
spell slot of 4th to 6th level, the area increases to a 10-foot square, the ice deals 4d6 cold damage, and 40 damage is needed to melt each 5-foot square. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the area increases to a 20-foot square, the ice deals 6d6 cold damage, and 60 damage is needed to melt each 5-foot square.


CURSE OF BOREAS
6th-level transmutation (winter)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 100 feetComponents: V , SDuration: Permanent
Y ou designate a creature within range that you can see. 
If the target fails a Charisma saving throw, it and its equipment are frozen solid, becoming an inert statue of 
ice. The creature is effectively paralyzed, but mental activity does not cease, and signs of life are detectable; the creature still breathes and its heart continues to beat, though both acts are almost imperceptible. If the ice statue is broken or damaged while frozen, the creature will have matching damage or injury when returned to its original state. Dispel magic can’t end this spell, but it can allow the target to speak (but not move or cast spells) for a number of rounds equal to the spell slot used. Greater restoration or more potent magic is needed to free a creature from the ice
.


DEEP FREEZE
4th-level evocation
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 60 feetComponents: V , S, M (a piece of ice or quartz)Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Y ou send a blast of deep cold at a creature, dealing  4d8 
cold damage to it and encasing it in ice. An encased creature is grappled and takes an extra 2d8 cold damage at the start of its turn every round it remains encased. If the target of this spell makes a successful Dexterity saving throw, it takes half the damage and none of the extra damage and is not encased in ice, but the ice that clings to its body reduces its speed by 15 feet (to a minimum speed of 5 feet) until it takes an action to remove the ice.


A grappled target can take an action to make a Strength
check against your spell save DC, breaking free of the ice on a success. Alternatively, another creature within 5 feet of the target can make a Strength check on its turn, freeing the creature on a success. The ice can also be attacked. It has AC 12, 10 hit points, and vulnerability to fire damage.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using 
a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 4th.


ENTOMB IN ICE
2nd-level evocation (winter)
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feetComponents: V , SDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Y ou trap a creature in a thick coating of ice. The target 
must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be restrained for the duration. At the beginning of the trapped creature’s turn, it takes 2d4 cold damage. On its turn, an entombed creature (or an ally) can take an action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. On a success, the entombed creature is freed. The icy tomb is also susceptible to damage and vulnerable to fire. Damage equal to your spell save DC will destroy the tomb and free the target.
271
WINTER MAGICAt Higher Levels. 
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 3rd. The creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.


EVERCOLD
4th-level necromancy (winter)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 30 feetComponents: V , S, M (an insect that froze to death)Duration: Until dispelled
Y ou target a creature within the spell’s range, and that 
creature must make a successful Wisdom saving throw or take 1d6 cold damage. In addition, the target is cursed to feel as if it’s exposed to extreme cold. For the duration of evercold, the target must make a successful DC 10 Constitution saving throw at the end of each hour or gain one level of exhaustion. The target has advantage on the hourly saving throws if wearing suitable cold-weather clothing, but it has disadvantage on saving throws against other spells and magic that deal cold damage (regardless of its clothing) for the spell’s duration.


The spell can be ended by its caster or by dispel magic or
remove curse.


FLURRY
1st-level transmutation (winter)

5th-level conjuration (winter)
Casting Time: 1 minute
Range: 60 feetComponents: V , S, M (a miniature keep carved from ice 
or glass that is consumed in the casting)
Duration: Until dispelled or destroyed


A gleaming fortress of ice springs from a square area of
ground that you can see within range. It is a 10-foot cube (including floor and roof). The fortress can’t overlap any other structures, but any creatures in its space are harmlessly lifted up as the ice rises into position. The walls are made of ice (AC 13), have 120 hit points each, and are immune to cold, necrotic, poison, and psychic damage. Reducing a wall to 0 hit points destroys it and has a 50 percent chance to cause the roof to collapse. A damaged wall can be repaired by casting a spell that deals cold damage on it, on a point-for-point basis.
Each wall has two arrow slits. One wall also includes 
an ice door with an arcane lock. Y ou designate at the time of the fort’s creation which creatures can enter the fortification. The door has AC 18 and 60 hit points, or it can be broken open with a successful DC 25 Strength (Athletics) check (DC 15 if the arcane lock is dispelled).
The fortress catches and reflects light, so that creatures 
outside the fortress who rely on sight have disadvantage on Perception checks and attack rolls made against those within the fortress if it’s in an area of bright sunlight.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using 
a spell slot of 6th level or higher, you can increase the length or width of the fortification by 5 feet for every slot level above 5th. Y ou can make a different choice (width or length) for each slot level above 5th.

Casting Time: 1 action
Range: SelfComponents: V , S, M (a miniature hammer carved from 
ice or glass)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour

ice appears in your hands. This weapon functions as a standard warhammer in all ways, and it deals an extra 1d10 cold damage on a hit. Y ou can drop the warhammer or give it to another creature.


The warhammer melts and is destroyed when it or its
user accumulates 20 or more fire damage, or when the spell ends.
At Higher Levels.  When you cast this spell using a spell 
slot of 3rd level or higher, you can create one additional 
hammer for each slot level above 2nd. Alternatively, you can create half as many hammers (round down), but each is oversized (1d10 bludgeoning damage, or 1d12 if wielded with two hands, plus 2d8 cold damage). Medium or smaller creatures have disadvantage when using oversized weapons, even if they are proficient with them.


ICICLE DAGGERS
1st-level conjuration (winter)
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: SelfComponents: V , S, M (a miniature dagger shaped like  
an icicle)
Duration: Instantaneous or special
When you cast this spell, three icicles appear in your hand. 
Each icicle has the same properties as a dagger but deals an extra 1d4 cold damage on a hit.


The icicle daggers melt a few seconds after leaving your
hand, making it impossible for other creatures to wield them. If the surrounding temperature is at or below freezing, the daggers last for 1 hour. They melt instantly if you take 10 or more fire damage.
At Higher Levels. If you cast this spell using a spell 
slot of 2nd level or higher, you can create two additional 
274
WINTER MAGICdaggers for each slot level above 1st. If you cast this spell

PROTECTIVE ICE
3rd-level abjuration (winter)
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: T ouchComponents: V , S, M (a seed encased in ice or glass)Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour
When you cast protective ice, you encase a willing target in 
icy, medium armor equivalent to a breastplate (AC 14). A creature without the appropriate armor proficiency has the usual penalties. If the target is already wearing armor, it only uses the better of the two armor classes.


A creature striking a target encased in protective ice with a
melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 1d6 cold damage.
If the armor’s wearer takes fire damage, an equal amount 
of damage is done to the armor, which has 30 hit points and is damaged only when its wearer takes fire damage. Damaged ice can be repaired by casting a spell that deals cold damage on it, on a point-for-point basis, but the armor can’t have more than 30 points repaired.At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 4th-level spell slot, it creates splint armor (AC 17 , 40 hit points). If you cast this spell using a 5th-level spell slot, it creates plate armor (AC 18, 50 hit points). The armor’s hit points increase by 10 for each spell slot above 5th, but the AC remains 18. Additionally, if you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the armor deals an extra +2 cold damage for each spell slot above 3rd.


SCULPT SNOW
2nd-level transmutation (winter)
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feetComponents: V , SDuration: Instantaneous
When you cast sculpt snow in an area filled with snow, you 
can create one Large object, two Medium objects, or four smaller objects from snow. With a casting time of 1 action, your sculptings bear only a crude resemblance to generic creatures or objects. If you increase the casting time to 1 minute, your creations take on a more realistic appearance and can even vaguely resemble specific creatures; the resemblance isn’t strong enough to fool anyone, but the 

275
WINTER MAGICcreature can be recognized. The sculptures are as durable 
as a typical snowman.


Sculptures created by this spell can be animated with
animate objects or comparable magic. Animated sculptures gain the AC, hit points, and other attributes provided by that spell. When they attack, they deal normal damage plus a similar amount of cold damage; an animated Medium sculpture, for example, deals 2d6 + 1 bludgeoning damage plus 2d6 + 1 cold damage.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using 
a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can sculpt one additional Large object for each slot level above 2nd. Two Large objects can be replaced with one Huge object.


SHEEN OF ICE
2nd-level evocation (winter)
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feetComponents: V , S, M (water within a glass globe)Duration: 1 minute


A small icy globe shoots from your finger to a point within
range and then explodes in a spray of ice. Each creature within 20 feet of that point must make a successful Dexterity saving throw or become coated in ice for 1 minute. Ice-coated creatures move at half speed. An invisible creature becomes outlined by the ice so that it loses the benefits of invisibility while the ice remains. The spell ends for a specific creature if that creature takes 5 or more fire damage
.


SHIVER
Evocation cantrip (winter)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 30 ft.Components: V , S, M (humanoid tooth)Duration: 1 round


Y ou fill a humanoid creature with such cold that its teeth
begin to chatter and its body shakes uncontrollably. Roll 5d8; the total is the maximum hit points of a creature this spell can affect. The affected creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or it cannot cast a spell or load a missile weapon until the end of your next turn. Once a creature has been affected by this spell, it is immune to further castings of this spell for 24 hours.
The maximum hit points you can affect increases by 4d8 
when you reach 5th level (9d8), 11th level (13d8), and 17th level (17d8).SNOW BOULDER
4th-level transmutation (winter)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 90 feetComponents: V , S, M (a handful of snow)Duration: Concentration, up to 4 rounds
A ball of snow forms 5 feet away from you and rolls in the 
direction you point at a speed of 30 feet, growing larger as it moves. T o roll the boulder into a creature, you must make a successful ranged spell attack. If the boulder hits, the creature must make a successful Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone and take the damage indicated below. Hitting a creature doesn’t stop the snow boulder’s movement or impede its growth, as long as you continue to maintain concentration on the effect. When the spell ends, the boulder stops moving.


ROUND  SIZE DAMAGE
1 Small 1d6 bludgeoning
2 Medium 2d6 bludgeoning

Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 120 feetComponents: V , S, M (a ring carved from chalk or  
white stone)
Duration: Instantaneous
This spell creates a simple “fort” from packed snow. The 
snow fort springs from the ground in an unoccupied space within range. It encircles a 10-foot area with sloping walls 4 feet high. The fort provides half cover (+2 AC) against ranged and melee attacks coming from outside the fort. The walls have AC 12, 30 hit points per side, are immune to cold, necrotic, poison, and psychic damage, and are vulnerable to fire damage. A damaged wall can be repaired by casting a spell that deals cold damage on it, on a point-for-point basis, up to a maximum of 30 points.


The spell also creates a dozen snowballs that can be
thrown (range 20/60) and that deal 1d4 bludgeoning damage plus 1d4 cold damage on a hit.

1st-level transmutation (winter)
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: T ouchComponents: V , SDuration: Concentration, up to 1 hour

appearance that gives it advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks to hide in snowy terrain. In addition, the target can use a bonus action to make itself invisible in snowy terrain for 1 minute. The spell ends at the end of the minute or when the creature attacks or casts a spell.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using 
a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 1st.

successful Constitution saving throw. Y ou regain hit points 
equal to the amount of cold damage taken by the target .
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the distance to the target you can affect with this spell increases by 5 feet for each slot level above 3rd.


TRIUMPH OF ICE
7th-level transmutation (winter)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 100 feetComponents: V , S, M (a stone extracted from glacial ice)Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Y ou transform one of the four elements—air, earth, fire, or 
water—into ice or snow. The affected area is a sphere with a radius of 100 feet, centered on you. The specific effect depends on the element you choose.
Air. Vapor condenses into snowfall. If the effect of a fog 
cloud spell, a stinking cloud, or similar magic is in the area, this spell negates it. A creature of elemental air within range takes 8d6 cold damage—and, if airborne, it must make a successful Constitution saving throw at the start of its turn to avoid being knocked prone (no falling damage).
Earth. Soil freezes into permafrost to a depth of 10 feet. 
A creature burrowing through the area has its speed halved until the area thaws, unless it can burrow through solid rock. A creature of elemental earth within range must make a successful Constitution saving throw or take 8d6 cold damage.
Fire. Flames or other sources of extreme heat (such as 
molten lava) on the ground within range transform into shards of ice, and the area they occupy becomes difficult terrain. Each creature in the previously burning area takes 2d6 slashing damage when the spell is cast and 1d6 slashing damage for every 5 feet it moves in the area (unless it is not hindered by icy terrain) until the spell ends; a successful Dexterity saving throw reduces the slashing damage by half. A creature of elemental fire within range must make a successful Constitution saving throw or take 8d6 cold damage and be stunned for 1d6 rounds. 
Water. 
Open water (a pond, lake, or river) freezes to 
a depth of 4 feet. A creature on the surface of the water when it freezes must make a successful Dexterity saving throw to avoid being trapped in the ice. A trapped creature can free itself by using an action to make a successful Strength (Athletics) check. A creature of elemental water within range takes no damage from the spell but is paralyzed for 1d6 rounds unless it makes a successful Constitution saving throw, and it treats the affected area as difficult terrain
.


WINTERDARK

solstice. Y ou target a 40-foot-radius, 60-foot-high cylinder centered on a point within range, which is plunged into darkness and unbearable cold. Each creature in the area when you cast the spell and at the start of its turn must make a successful Constitution saving throw or take 1d6 cold damage and gain one level of exhaustion. Creatures immune to cold damage are also immune to the exhaustion effect, as are creatures wearing cold weather gear or otherwise adapted for a cold environment.
As a bonus action, you can move the center of the effect 
20 feet.

of sunlight reflecting off fresh snow blankets the area. A creature caught in the spell’s area must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or have disadvantage on ranged attacks and Wisdom (Perception) checks for the duration of the spell. In addition, an affected creature’s vision is hampered such that foes it targets are treated as having three-quarters cover.


WINTRY GLIDE
4th-level conjuration (winter)
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: SelfComponents: V , SDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Upon casting wintry glide, you can travel via ice or snow 
without crossing the intervening space. If you are adjacent to a mass of ice or snow, you can enter it by expending 5 feet of movement. By expending another 5 feet of movement, you can immediately exit from that mass at any point—within 500 feet—that’s part of the contiguous mass of ice or snow. When you enter the ice or snow, you instantly know the extent of the material within 500 feet. Y ou must have at least 10 feet of movement available when you cast the spell, or it fails.


If the mass of ice or snow is destroyed while you are
transiting it, you must make a successful Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC to avoid taking 4d6 bludgeoning damage and falling prone at the midpoint of a line between your entrance point and your intended exit point.THE FROZEN ONE
This is typically a powerful entity of winter, such as the avatar of Boreas (T ome of Beasts, p. 42), but prominent ice maidens (T ome of Beasts, p. 254), ice devils, and other 
creatures associated with the cold can also serve as patrons.


WARLOCK OTHERWORLDLY PATRON
Y our patron seeks to immerse the world in eternal winter or bring about some similar fate. Though you might not share this goal, you have sworn fealty to this being, and you act as its agent to spread winter wherever you roam.


EXPANDED SPELL LIST

DEFLECTIVE ICE
Starting at 1st level, you can bring a small chunk of ice to your aid. As a reaction when a creature makes a weapon attack against you, the ice shields you from the attack. The creature has disadvantage on its attack roll. Regardless of the result of the attack, the ice melts away immediately afterward. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.


FROZEN PATH
Beginning at 6th level, as part of your move, you can leave a layer of ice on the ground along your path. This ice persists for 1 minute. A creature other than you that enters a space of ice must make a successful Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC or fall prone in that space. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.


ICY BODY
Beginning at 10th level, your skin takes on an icy sheen. Y ou are immune to cold damage, and you have advantage on Strength and Dexterity checks you make to escape from being grappled.

WINTER MAGIC
PACT BOON
At 3rd level, the Frozen One bestows a gift upon you for 
your loyal service. Y ou gain one of the following features of your choice.
Pact of the Blade. Y our pact weapon has a patina of 
ice, and small icicles dangle from it. When you create or summon your pact weapon, you can choose whether it deals its standard damage type or cold damage.
Pact of the Chain. When you conjure your familiar 
or change its form, you can choose the form of an ice mephit in addition to the usual options granted by the pact boon. When you use your action to command your mephit familiar to attack, it can use its breath or cast an innate spell instead.
Pact of the Tome. Y our book is formed from rune-
etched sheets of ice that are cold to the touch to everyone but you. The book is immune to cold damage.


ELDRITCH INVOCATIONS
The following invocations are available to Frozen One warlocks.


BOREAL AURA
Prerequisite: 3rd level, Frozen One patron
Ice and snow cascade around you. When you use an action, 
your melee attacks deal an extra 1d6 cold damage, and attackers within 5 feet of you who hit you in melee take 1d6 cold damage, for as long as you maintain concentration.


HORRIFIC WINTRY VISAGE
Prerequisite: 5th level, Frozen One patron
Y ou can cast sculpt snow once using a warlock spell slot. Creatures that see your sculpture for the first time must make a successful Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or become frightened of the sculpture for 1 round. Y ou must finish a long rest before using this invocation again.


BOREAL BLOODLINE
Y our innate magic comes from the power of divine or magical entities of winter, beings born to the ice and cold.


SORCEROUS ORIGIN
Y ou might trace your descent down a line of ancestry from a mighty sorcerer that bargained with the God of the North Wind for power, or that formed a pact with powerful creatures of ice and snow. Or perhaps you are the first of the bloodline, the product of a union between a parent of your own kind and some wintry being. Y ou WINTRY BLAST
Starting at 14th level, you can designate a creature you see within 60 feet of you. It must make a Constitution saving throw against your warlock spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature feels numbing cold emanating from your patron. The creature takes 10d10 cold damage and must make another Constitution saving throw. If the second saving throw is failed, the creature is also restrained for 1 minute. A creature restrained in this way repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the condition on a success. After using this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before using it again.
279


WINTER MAGIC
might even be the originator of it—the first one to traffic 
with a powerful boreal being in order to master the icy might of winter magic.


NUMBING COLD
Starting when you choose this origin at 1st level, your affinity for winter means that your enemies suffer more than normal from the cold spells you cast. A creature that takes cold damage from one of your spells takes extra damage equal to your Charisma modifier.


WINTER'S CHILD
Y our affinity with winter allows you to venture forth in the cold without harm. Y ou never suffer the effects of extreme cold, even if you are not dressed for the weather. Additionally, you can move over snow and ice without taking penalties for difficult terrain.


GELID FORM
At 6th level, you gain resistance to cold damage. Also, when you use sorcery points to apply a Metamagic option to a spell that deals cold damage or that produces an effect that involves snow or ice (sleet storm, for example), you can reduce the cost by 1 sorcery point, to a minimum of 1 point.


WINTER'S FORM
At 14th level, you can give your wintry power physical form. As a bonus action, you can spend 1 sorcery point to transform your body for 1 minute. When you use this feature, you can take one of two forms:
• Y our body transforms into a swirling mass of sleet or snow. Y our gear transforms with you or falls to the ground in the space you occupy, as you choose. While in this form, you cannot speak, manipulate objects, attack, or cast spells. Y ou gain immunity to cold damage, resistance to nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, and vulnerability to fire damage. In this form, your only method of movement is a flying speed of 60 feet, and you can hover. Y ou can pass through small holes and narrow openings at least 1 inch in width, but you treat liquids as if they were solid surfaces. Y ou cannot fall, and you remain hovering even while stunned or incapacitated. Y ou can enter the space of another creature and remain there. Any creature whose space you occupy takes cold damage equal to your Charisma modifier. 
• Y our body transforms into translucent, blue-white ice, and your hair becomes a crown of snow. Y ou gain immunity to cold damage, resistance to nonmagical bludgeoning damage, and vulnerability to fire damage, and your Armor Class is never lower than 15 + your Dexterity modifier. Any creature within 5 feet of you that hits you with a melee weapon attack or a touch attack takes cold damage equal to your Charisma modifier. While in this form, you gain a slam attack with your icy fists that deals 1d4 bludgeoning damage plus cold damage equal to your Charisma modifier.


WINTER'S SOUL
At 18th level, you gain immunity to cold damage and resistance to fire damage. (Y ou don’t have this resistance when you use Winter’s Form, but you also no longer gain vulnerability to fire damage when you use that feature.) When you cast a spell that deals cold damage, any creature that gets a failure on its saving throw against the spell is also encased in ice, becoming grappled until it or a creature allied with it within 5 feet succeeds on a Strength check against your spell save DC. If the spell does not normally allow a saving throw, the creature makes a saving throw to avoid being grappled. If the spell already causes the grappled condition, the creature has disadvantage on the saving throw.

WIZARD'S ENTOURAGEThe brooding archmage alone in his tower is a staple of
fantasy literature. The more powerful the wizard becomes, the more distant he or she seems from the common folk, and the greatest wizards are often the most misunderstood or feared. Some wizards try to alleviate this loneliness by passing on their knowledge to those around them, taking on one or more apprentices. Others create magic constructs to guard their homes—or simply to keep them company—and wizards summon familiars for much the same reason.


This section describes various companions and
accoutrements that a powerful spellcaster, particularly a wizard, might have. These creatures and features help to flesh out a wizard’s home and are often encountered in the wizard’s stead. Finally, they provide opportunities for adventure, either independent of the wizard or linked to the spellcaster.


Apprentices
Every archmage needs someone to clean dishes, tend to meals, and wash bedpans. Although some wizards use spells or servants to perform these duties, others give these jobs to their apprentices, budding wizards they have taken under their wings to learn the esteemed art of magic. Many wizards also rely on their apprentices to deal with the riffraff who wander into their towers looking for help; for many player characters, the wizard’s apprentice is their first point of contact.


Wizard's Entourage
281


WIZARD'S ENTOURAGE
Below are presented five apprentices that can be inserted 
into a new or ongoing campaign. These apprentices are 
more than just collections of numbers; each has his or her own history and motivations that can impact the lives of the characters who deal with them.


LEREILEL CLOUDWOOD
“Magic never judges you based on your appearance. It doesn’t care if you are fat or thin, if you are beautiful or ugly. Magic accepts you the way you are.” 
Lereilel Cloudwood (NG female human 2nd-level 
wizard) is a young woman in her early twenties with dark reddish-brown hair, pale green eyes, and numerous freckles. Overweight and lacking confidence, Lereilel has always been anxious about her appearance and is frequently tongue-tied, particularly when dealing with members of the opposite sex. She has a real passion for magic, however, and was taken in as an apprentice by Ravin Wyrdstone (LN male human 16th-level wizard [transmuter]), who has great faith in Lereilel’s abilities. 
Background. Lereilel was born into an affluent family 
and displayed an affinity for magic when she came of age—much to the chagrin of her socialite mother, who constantly expressed her disappointment that Lereilel had taken after her father’s looks and whims. Although she was discouraged by her mother’s disapproval and the mirthful stares of the men her mother brought to woo her, Lereilel eventually convinced her father to let her study magic under the tutelage of Ravin Wyrdstone. Since then, Lereilel has worked hard to prove herself but still thinks that her appearance holds her back. She has faith that the transmutation magic she is studying might hold the key to “correcting” her unsightly looks and finally make her mother proud of her. 
Recently, Lereilel has been seeing Thaliydor Brightcrest, 
a handsome half-elf and a local carpenter who seems to think the world of her despite her homeliness. Unfortunately for her, Lereilel does not realize she is being duped and that Thaliydor is actually an assassin (CE male half-elf 5th-level rogue) who is using her to get closer to her master. 
Personality. Loreilel is highly intelligent and well 
versed in arcane lore, but finds it difficult to speak with people and has been something of a wallflower throughout her life. As such, she can easily be taken advantage of by someone who gives her any attention, particularly if that person is both attractive and charming. If Lereilel realizes that Thaliydor’s feelings are false, the last shreds of her confidence might finally break, leading her to do something potentially self-destructive unless someone steps in to save her. 
Plot Hook. One easy way for the characters to become 
involved with Lereilel is to have them hired by her master as guards. Ravin is concerned that he might be the target of an assassination attempt by an old enemy and wants the characters to protect him and his apprentice until he can track down the villain. Strangely, the archmage is more concerned about Lereilel than he is about himself and tells the characters to watch her carefully. Alternatively, they could be hired by Lereilel’s father to check on his daughter and see how she is doing. Regardless of how the characters become involved, their arrival puts a major chink in Thaliydor’s plans and forces the assassin’s hand, as the half-elf hires a band of evil brigands to deal with the characters while he uses Lereilel as bait to make an attempt on the life of her master.

WIZARD'S ENTOURAGETERINDOR GRAYVEIL
“Ever since my sister was forced to marry that horrible noble, I’ve 
been looking for a way to free her. Y ou lot might be just the heroes I need.” 
T erindor Grayveil (CG male human 1st-level wizard) is a 
wiry lad of fifteen with unruly orange hair and deep blue eyes. An earnest and helpful soul, T erindor is also far smarter than most of the adults around him and has taken to the study of magic with natural aplomb. His master is Elgretta Mathelzor (LG female human 14th-level wizard [evoker]), a famous war wizard who is often away on military campaigns, leaving T erindor to fend for himself.
Background . T erindor was born to hard-working but 
luckless mercantile parents who gave everything they had 
to make the lives of their children better, even teaching them letters and history to help them establish themselves in the world. The family became crippled by debt, and rather than seeing her parents cast out onto the streets, T erindor’s sister, Ileena, agreed to marry a lecherous noble in order to save the family business. Shortly thereafter, T erindor sought out the war wizard and begged to become her apprentice—a move that shocked his mother and father, even more so when Elgretta agreed. Since then, T erindor has worked hard at his training, moving forward in leaps and bounds even though his master is frequently absent. 
Personality .


T erindor is a
determined lad who consistently pushes himself to become a better wizard. While maintaining this focus, he frequently pauses his studies to help out those in need, whether by fixing the roof of a spinster’s cottage or driving out giant rats from the local brewery.


Well -liked by those in his
community, he is also the only one not awestruck by his mistress, who is renowned for her success in single-handedly destroying a horde of goblins and felling a mighty white dragon with a barrage of spells. T erindor’s main reason for wanting to become stronger 
is to free Ileena from her forced marriage. Although he knows that Elgretta sympathizes with him, she has told him quite bluntly that seeking retribution against the noble is wrong and not something she can be part of. 
Plot Hook . While he is training, T erindor keeps his 
ear to the ground in the community for talk of passing 
adventurers, particularly those who don’t care about breaking the rules but are still fundamentally good at heart. If he hears of the characters’ deeds, he approaches them at his first opportunity and expresses his desire to help his sister out of her predicament. T erindor has nothing to give the characters in payment but promises to help them enchant their gear when he becomes a more powerful wizard. If the characters seem about to refuse his request, he offers them the services of Elgretta—a promise that he knows might cause him a lot of trouble in the future.


EROLIMAR
“Master T aramind took me on as his apprentice even though there were more suitable candidates. I’ll be forever grateful to him.”
Erolimar (LG male elf 1st -level wizard) is a young elf with 
sweeping silvery locks and amethyst eyes. Stout of limb, graceful and handsome, Erolimar seems almost like the perfect elf—yet despite these qualities, he has been cursed with only middling intelligence and wisdom, making him a poor choice as a wizard’s apprentice. Nevertheless, he has been taken on by T aramind the Scorched (NE elf male 15th-level wizard [conjurer]), a mysterious elf with hideously burned features who is known for his dealings with elementals and fiends.
Background . Erolimar comes from a long line of 
accomplished spellcasters. Indeed, it was expected that 
young Erolimar would enroll at an esteemed college of magic when he came of age so he could follow in his forebears’ footsteps. This would have been the case, had he passed the entrance exam. Soon, it became clear that Erolimar was not the paragon of wizardry his father and mother thought he would be. Dejected, he turned his back on magic to pursue the meaningful but far less prestigious role of hunter for his village. 
J
ust when it seemed that magic had left Erolimar 
behind, he was saved by T aramind, who approached the young elf to be his apprentice. At first fearful of the wizard’s reputation, Erolimar finally accepted the offer and has taken to his new position with gusto, unaware that his master has taken him on to prepare Erolimar’s soul for sacrifice to a fiend, whose life force he will then transfer into the young elf ’s body.

283


WIZARD'S ENTOURAGE
Personality . Erolimar 
is a kind-hearted, 
generous, and naive individual who does not see a bad bone in anyone around him. Even T aramind, with his menacing demeanor and harsh teaching methods, does not set off Erolimar’s alarm bells; he prefers to focus on his master’s strengths, rather than than worry about his flaws. Erolimar is envied by many in his village for his good looks and natural agility, but they are also aware of his failings, and there are few who can hold a bad thought in their hearts for the elf for too long. 
Plot Hook . The characters are hired by the local elf 
population to investigate a spate of bizarre animal attacks 
in the vicinity of T aramind’s mansion. The attacks have been violent and erratic, the animals in question extremely vicious and difficult to kill. During their investigation, the characters run into Erolimar, and the elf proves to be helpful on more than one occasion. Eventually (perhaps with Erolimar’s help), they realize that the animals have become possessed by lesser fiends and that some sort of conjuration magic is responsible. It is at this point when T aramind begins to prepare the young elf for sacrifice, and it is up to the characters to save him. How this plays out is up to the GM, but T aramind is no pushover—his mansion is home to magic traps, bound fiends, and terrible golems.ARN OF ROWAN
“I was a warrior before I became a wizard, a sword for hire who traveled the world looking for adventure. I made a name for myself as well. Perhaps you’ve heard of me? Arn’s the name—Arn of Rowan.” 
Arn of Rowan (CN male human 12th-level 
fighter/2nd -level wizard) is a strapping man in his 
mid -thirties with long brown hair, a thick beard, and 
piercing black eyes. T all and full of vigor, Arn seems like an odd choice for a wizard’s apprentice, and his master, Jainara Meadowwands (LN female human 9th-level wizard [illusionist]), seems more like a harried wife than a teacher. Indeed, most people find their pairing to be odd, especially given that Arn is much more famous than his master
. 
284
WIZARD'S ENTOURAGEBackground . Arn began his career as a soldier in the 
army of a self-righteous duke who waged war against his 
neighbors under the pretense of dispensing justice. It was during this bloody time that Arn solidified his reputation as a vicious fighter with axe and shield, and once the duke had his fill of warfare, Arn forged his own career as a mercenary for hire, basing himself in the small town of Rowan, which he soon put on the map with his legendary exploits.


It was after one particularly harrowing mission that Arn
drank too much ale at the local tavern and lost a bet to one of his companions, a bard who claimed that Arn could never master any trade but that of the blade. Haughtily, Arn took up the challenge and availed himself of the talents of Jainara Meadowwands, a mousy-haired woman and capable illusionist, agreeing to pay off her debts in exchange for becoming her pupil. Jainara accepted the deal, believing that Arn would quickly grow bored and leave—but much to her amazement, he not only stayed but quickly excelled as her student. 
Personality . Arn is a boisterous and carefree individual 
who has many scars and tales from his past. Naturally 
charismatic and with an unusually keen intellect, he would probably have been a lord by now if it were not for his chaotic nature. The fact that he is good at magecraft does not surprise Arn, since he is good at whatever he puts his mind to. What does surprise him, however, is that he actually enjoys the work. He has also grown quite fond of Jainara, and finds her presence strangely calming. 
Plot Hook . The characters are passing through the 
area when Rowan is attacked by a flight of wyvern-riding 
hobgoblins. Arn and Jainara are also present, and through their combined efforts they and the characters manage to turn back the attack. Jainara is injured during the fight, and it is at this stage that Arn decides to turn his back on the blade and try being a wizard full-time. Of course, being Arn of Rowan, he cannot let the culprits get away with hurting his master, so he offers the PCs his magic battleaxe if they track the hobgoblins back to their base and finish them off.


XELASORA
“Master Dramothir will be with you shortly. Just be sure to mind your manners and don’t put any dirt on the furniture.” 
Xelasora (LN female dragonborn 1st-level sorcerer/1st-
level wizard) is a graceful dragonborn in her late teens with mottled blue and green scales, four short horns that sweep back from her brow, and large amber eyes. She also has a large, reddish birthmark on her left shoulder that she normally keeps hidden under her robes. Xelasora is serious and humble and possesses a razor-sharp mind. Her master is Dramothir Galefnir (LG male dwarf 12th-level wizard [abjurer]), who in addition to being a learned mage is also a renowned artisan and jeweler.
Background . The youngest of seven siblings, Xelasora 
lived a happy childhood, until the disastrous day when a 
red dragon attacked her community and killed the rest of her family. Mentally and emotionally scarred by the experience, Xelasora withdrew into herself after she was placed in an orphanage. She was ostracized by the other children in the orphanage, who were mostly human and considered her little more than a monster. Eventually, her pent-up emotions boiled over and she unleashed some of her latent magic, setting fire to the clothing of one of her tormentors. This act led to her being expelled from the orphanage and forced to live on the streets, where she barely managed to stay alive by using her powers. Finally, when all hope seemed lost, Xelasora was taken 

285
WIZARD'S ENTOURAGEin by the mage Dramothir, a dwarf who was intrigued by 
her intelligence and wit, and who was a natural sucker for a damsel in distress. Since then, Xelasora has done her best to be a dutiful apprentice and astutely handles Dramothir’s busy schedule.
Personality .


Xelasora is the best student that any
wizard could hope for. She pursues both her magical 
studies and her mundane duties with the same rigorous attention to detail and is faultless in her execution. Her poised exterior, however, conceals a tormented soul. She constantly doubts herself and is worried that she could lose control of her sorcerous abilities if she becomes flustered or upset. The deaths of her family and the trouble she faced at the orphanage also still weigh on her heavily, and lately she has been plagued with dreams of fire and shadowy flying shapes, causing her to suddenly awaken in terror.
Plot Hook . Xelasora’s magic comes from a bit of theft: 
in her younger days, she stole a set of scrolls from an ancient red dragon. The dragon still exists in the form of a terrible undead monstrosity, and it shares a strange link with the young dragonborn that allows the two of them to share dreams and images of their lives. By the time the characters enter the picture, the dragon is close to discovering Xelasora’s location—and when it does so, it plans to slay her and recover its scrolls. Before this event comes to pass, the characters have a chance to stop it, either by destroying the dragon or somehow trapping it. Of course, defeating an undead dragon is no easy feat; depending on the characters’ level, the GM might want to lead them up to the event with battles against the dragon’s servants in the form of ghouls, trolls, vampires, and lesser evil dragons.Magic Constructs
Golems and similar constructs are common features in a wizard’s home. The most powerful mages have access to even more dangerous and complex automatons. Although golems are the most common of these constructs, they seldom have any individuality or personality, making them little more than defensive window-dressing. 
Described below are several unique magic constructs, 
each with its own history and personality. Some of them are presented along with ready-made adventure scenarios.
BZELDRUIN’S HUNDRED
Spread out across the ground before you is an impressive collection of close to a hundred wooden miniatures. Each figure resembles an adult male, an adult female, or a child. Most seem to be human, but you can see elves, dwarves, halflings, and even a few centaurs and other creatures scattered among them. As soon as you notice them, the figures begin to mimic your every movement. 
Bzeldruin’s Hundred is a group of one hundred wooden 
miniature figures created by the gnomish transmuter Bzeldruin Tiwaskar to represent his friends and family. Bzeldruin created them in celebration of his life’s many 

286
WIZARD'S ENTOURAGEachievements, but their creation was flawed and they 
became inhabited by an evil spirit that sought to slay the very people they were modeled after. Unable to bring himself to destroy them, Bzeldruin tried to seal them away in the depths of his tower—and although he succeeded, the effort cost him his life. Now his tower lies deserted, enticing explorers with the promise of powerful magic if they can overcome the horrors within.
BZELDRUIN’S HUNDRED

Immutable Form. Bzeldruin’s Hundred is immune to any 
spell or effect that would alter its form.
Magic Resistance. Bzeldruin’s Hundred has advantage on 
saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
Magic Weapons.  Weapon attacks made by Bzeldrin’s 
Hundred are magical.
Perfect Mimicry. The scores of individual figures that make 
up the swarm can perfectly mimic the actions of a single 
humanoid creature within 30 feet as an action. The swarm can mimic only one creature at a time, and the act of doing so grants the construct advantage on attack rolls and saving throws it makes involving the mimicked creature until the start of the construct’s next turn.
Swarm. The swarm can occupy another creature’s space and 
vice versa, and the swarm can move through any opening large enough for a Tiny figurine. The swarm can’t regain hit points or gain temporary hit points.
Rejuvenation. If Bzeldruin’s Hundred is reduced to 0 hit 
points, it collapses and disintegrates into dust, then re-forms 24 hours later in the same location with its full hit points. There is no way to stop this rejuvenation from happening, 
short of a carefully worded wish spell or divine intervention.


ACTIONS
Slam. Melee Weapon Attack:  +8 to hit, reach 0 ft., one target 
in the swarm’s space. Hit: 33 (8d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage. 
If the swarm is reduced to half its hit points or fewer, the bludgeoning damage from its slam attack is 19 (4d6 + 5).
Hindering Strike.  Any Medium or smaller creature damaged 
by the swarm must make a DC 15 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, several of the figures cling to its body, reducing its speed by 10 feet and giving it disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws and Dexterity checks. A creature can repeat the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
LEOTHAR’S BUST


Floating before you is an exquisitely-crafted bust of a middle -aged
man with a balding pate and a well-cropped beard. The bust 
appears to be constructed out of white marble. Its features are animated, and the entity is watching you with an expectant expression. Close behind the bust are two maids’ uniforms, suspended in the air as though being worn by unseen creatures.


The archmage Leothar Wickerfrost is a noted explorer and
adventurer, and as such is often away from home for long periods of time. During some of these absences, thieves raided his tower, and after he surprised them on his return, he ended up spending a lot of time cleaning up their corpses. T o rid himself of this chore, the wizard decided to create the perfect servant, a bust in his own magnificent image endowed with magical power. 
Leothar’s bust shares many traits with its creator. It has 
the same haughty and egomaniacal attitude and looks down on those who cannot wield magic. The construct is scrupulous in its duties and is in command of the tower’s many servants, including a pair of modified unseen servants wearing maid outfits. Leothar’s bust welcomes visitors with the same abrasive manner its creator displays, whether they are legitimate guests or intruders, but will not take hostile action against creatures until it can discern 
the details of their intentions.

one target. Hit: 14 (4d4 + 4) force damage.
Paralysis Ray. Ranged Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, range 60

Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. A creature can repeat this save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
Slam. Melee Weapon Attack:  +1 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. 
Hit: 4 (1d4 + 2) bludgeoning damage.
NISRUEL’S COACHFLY
This long, narrow contraption resembles a clockwork dragonfly 
that’s larger than a horse. It is fashioned from silver and lapis lazuli, with panes of delicate-looking multicolored stained glass for wings. The back of the construct contains a hollow that looks like it could hold one or more occupants. 
Decades ago, the noble half -elf 
wizard Nisruel created a beautiful clockwork construct fashioned after the enormous dragonflies of her marshy homeland. Though she was usually content to teleport when she wanted to go somewhere, sometimes Nisruel wanted to travel in style—so she crafted this construct to impress her friends and others in the elven court. Word of her wondrous carriage spread throughout the land shortly after she revealed it, and Nisruel enjoyed receiving recognition for her work. 
Sadly, her fame also drew the ire of her rival, the 
sorceress Ymelda, who lured Nisruel and her construct into the web of a gargantuan spider before ambushing the wizard with foul magic. Both Nisruel and Ymelda died in this struggle, but Nisruel’s construct survived intact, and it still lies caught up in the webs of the great arachnid, awaiting rescue.

Compartment. One Medium creature, two Small creatures, 
or four Tiny creatures can comfortably fit inside the 
compartment at the rear of the coachfly. A creature inside the compartment is protected from the effects of wind, rain, and snow, and can share any spell it casts on itself with the coachfly if the spell also affects constructs. A creature can enter or leave the compartment as an action but cannot 

288


WIZARD'S ENTOURAGEfall out even if the coachfly is upside
down and has advantage on grapple checks to avoid being dragged out. Creatures in the compartment also have total cover against all attacks, though if the coachfly fails a saving throw against an area attack that deals damage, those in the compartment take half as much damage. If the coachfly is destroyed, occupants are ejected into an unoccupied space within 5 feet of it. 
  An occupant of the compartment 
can direct the coachfly to move and to make attacks against a target within range. Only one occupant can direct the coachfly in each round, even if it has multiple occupants. If the coachfly is not being controlled, it moves and attacks only to defend itself. 
Immutable Form. The coachfly is 
immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form.
Magic Resistance. The coachfly has advantage on saving 
throws against spells and other magical effects.


ACTIONS
Multiattack.  The coachfly makes two Light Ray attacks.
Light Ray. Ranged Spell Attack:  +6 to hit, range 120 ft., one 
target. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) radiant damage. A creature struck by the ray must also make a successful DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be blinded until the end of its next turn.
SIVVAR’S WRITING DESK


This large ebony writing table has glossy brass fittings and a
broad, flat top, dangling from which is a thin brass chain. Carved at the end of the desk’s wooden legs are the claws of some sort of beast. As you approach, these claws animate and paw menacingly at the ground. 
Over a century ago, the wizard Sivvar was counted among 
the most learned historians of his age. So respected was he that people came from miles around to ask him for help in tracking down lost relics, forgotten tombs, and ancient ruins. The knowledge he amassed came with a price, though, and Sivvar eventually gathered many secrets that were too dangerous to be shared openly. T o protect himself and his works, Sivvar fashioned a construct out of his writing desk. Not only would this piece of simple furniture store the knowledge he had gathered, it would protect itself from harm if someone tried to take the contents by force.
Recently, after years of foiling or dodging enemy 
attacks, Sivvar suddenly vanished, leaving his desk and other worldly possessions in the care of his sister’s granddaughter, Emelia Nightmace. Emelia knows that her great-uncle’s mansion and possessions are potentially dangerous and seeks the help of adventurers to enter the place and catalogue its contents. What she doesn’t know is that Sivvar is still alive somewhere inside the mansion, and his desk holds the key to contacting him.

the caster’s spell save DC or become inanimate for 1 minute.
Immutable Form. The desk is immune to any spell or effect 
that would alter its form.
False Appearance.  While the desk remains motionless, it is 
indistinguishable from a normal writing desk.
Locked Drawers. The drawers of the desk are locked by a 
modified version of the arcane lock spell. The desk opens its drawers when someone speaks the appropriate command word. If someone tries to open the drawers without the correct password, the desk animates and attacks.


Oddities For Every OccasionACTIONS
Multiattack. The desk makes two claw attacks. 
Claw. Melee Weapon Attack:  +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. 
Hit: 14 (3d6 + 4) slashing damage.
Rake. If the desk hits the same target with both claw attacks, 
it rakes the victim for an extra 10 (3d6) slashing damage.


REACTIONS
Desperate Escape (1/day).  The desk can use dimension door 
as a bonus action. It uses this ability only when reduced to 
10 hit points or fewer.


From wands that shoot out darts of force and potions that
allow you to breathe underwater to magic airships and iron barrels that turn into crabs, wizards are behind the creation of most of the magic items found in a standard fantasy setting. Y et not every magic item is as generally useful or powerful as those mentioned above. Some of the magic items found in a wizard’s laboratory or workshop fill a niche role, are the results of failed experiments, function as normal magic items but have a different appearance, or are just plain bizarre.
While characters explore a wizard’s tower or 
stronghold, an adventurer might come across a variety of strange magic items, some of which are more helpful than others. T o determine what a character finds while searching, roll on the table below or choose one or more items at your discretion. 
D20 MAGIC ITEM
1 An animated weapon rack with long, thin wooden arms that hands out any item stored in it on command. The weapon rack doesn’t defend itself if attacked (AC 15, hp 20, damage threshold 3, vulnerability to fire damage).
2 A battered copper lantern that sings a bawdy folk tale in Goblin whenever oil is placed inside it and it is lit. The singing can be heard clearly from up to 300 feet away. 
3 A chamber pot that teleports its contents into an extradimensional space on command. There is a 25 percent chance that the chamber pot malfunctions and teleports its contents onto the head of a nearby creature. 
4 A bright purple skullcap with fancy golden embroidery that turns the wearer’s head invisible and renders the wearer mute. The wearer can see and hear normally, and can remove the skullcap without impediment. 
5 A painting of a beautiful half-elf girl staring off into a pond. The girl animates and curtsies whenever a living creature comes within 10 feet of her. If the painting is attacked, the girl cowers in terror but does not make a sound. The painting is as hard as steel (AC 19, hp 20, damage threshold 8, resistance to all damage). 
6 A wind chime made of bones that emits a clear ringing sound whenever any spell is cast within 30 feet of it. The chime does not react to normal winds and does not activate while being carried, worn, or held. 
7 A tiny animated bronze rat that causes irrational fear in any feline that sees it. A feline creature of challenge rating 1 or lower that comes within 30 feet of the rat must make a successful DC 10 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. The rat has the statistics of a normal rat, but it is immune to poison and psychic damage and to being charmed, frightened, exhausted, paralyzed, poisoned, petrified, or stunned. 
8 A white silk handkerchief that functions as a cloak of protection, but only when worn by a Tiny creature.  There is a 33 percent chance that the handkerchief is currently being worn by a homunculus.
9
A set of false black eyelashes in a metal case. The lashes can be put on or removed as an action. Whenever a creature the wearer would be physically attracted to comes within 10 feet, the wearer is forced to wink repeatedly in the direction of the other creature. The wearer can resist this compulsion with a successful DC 11 Wisdom saving throw.
290
WIZARD'S ENTOURAGE10 Twelve identical decorative silver nails that ignore the damage threshold of any nonmagical object they are nailed 
into and can hold up to 5,000 pounds of weight. The nails cannot be used as weapons, and they lose their magic if they are extracted after being used. 
11 A clear crystal prism containing a mummified elven ear. When the prism is placed against a surface where a compartment lies beyond, such as a closed door, a random illusory sound is generated that seems to be coming from the other side.
12 A leather-bound booklet that contains illustrations of various creatures and objects. The booklet functions as a robe of useful items, except that it has only the twelve patches found on each robe. When the last page is torn out, the booklet becomes useless.
13 A ceramic and gold bathtub shaped like a dragon and painted bright crimson. The bathtub fills with hot, scented water that pours from the dragon’s maw on command and fills the tub. The bathtub regains the use of this ability each day at dawn. 
14 A glass globe filled with pale yellow smoke that swirls menacingly when touched. When shattered, the globe replicates the effects of a wand of wonder and produces a smell like rotten eggs. The sphere magically re-forms in 1d6 days unless dispel magic is cast on the fragments. 
15 A tiny lump of cream-colored wax in a small wooden box. It shapes itself into a wax duplicate of any living creature that touches it for more than 1 round. The creature that was mimicked can cause its duplicate to move up to 10 feet as an action and to perform simple actions (but not attack). The wax figurine has a Strength score of 2 for lifting and carrying purposes. After 1 hour, the wax duplicate becomes inert and resumes its normal form. It cannot be reactivated until the following dawn.
16 A potted plant of unknown origin in a dark blue vase. The plant’s berries are actually gems worth 10 gp each. A total of 2d6 gems can be collected from the plant, but if every gem is picked the plant transforms into either a great mandrake (Creature Codex, p. 260) or an awakened tree and attacks the picker.
17
A featureless wooden mannequin that cloaks itself in the illusion of whatever clothing the viewer desires. The range of clothing the mannequin can generate is limited only by the viewer’s imagination. The mannequin is treated as a normal wooden object for combat purposes (AC 15, hp 30, damage threshold 4, vulnerability to fire damage). 
18 A featureless wooden mannequin holding a wooden sword and shield that stands silently in the center of a 20-foot-radius red circle. The mannequin animates when a creature brandishing a weapon enters the circle. The mannequin uses the statistics of either a wood golem (Creature Codex, p. 201) or animated armor. If it reduces a creature to 0 hit points, the creature is knocked unconscious rather than being killed. The mannequin stops attacking if the creature threatening it or attacking it leaves the circle. 
19 A small gilded birdcage covered in exotic filigree and mounted on a greenstone plinth. The cage grants the semblance of life to any dead creature of Tiny size placed inside it. The creature appears to be alive for all intents and purposes, but only while it is inside the cage. As soon as the creature leaves the cage, it returns to its dead state in the same condition it entered. The cage ceases to function if removed from its plinth. The cage currently holds a songbird (01–25), a raven (26–50), or a pixie (56–75), or is empty (76–00).
20 A Large stone font inscribed with arcane symbols. The font produces one dose of a random potion each day at dawn. Someone who drinks from the font gains the effect of the potion. If the liquid is removed from the font and placed inside another container, it loses its magical properties. The font weighs more than 200 pounds, so transporting it is difficult.

WIZARD'S ENTOURAGEFamiliar Territory
Although the list of available familiars in the standard 
rules is sufficient for most campaigns, some players and GMs might enjoy using an unusual creature that has features not found in other familiars.


T o determine what familiar an NPC spellcaster might
have, the GM can roll on one of the tables in this section or select a creature. Players can also use these tables to choose familiars for their characters, with the GM’s approval. (Of course, any creature that can be a familiar must also exist in the world on its own.)
The familiars presented here are of two basic kinds: 
standard familiars, which function the same as other beasts that serve the caster of the find familiar spell, and variant familiars, each of which is an intelligent creature that offers a special benefit to its master.


COMMON TRAITS
As stated in the find familiar spell, each of these creatures gains the celestial, fey, or fiend type (spellcaster’s choice) when it becomes a familiar. Also, as noted in the spell, a familiar can’t attack (though it can deliver a touch spell on behalf of its master). The stat blocks in this section include information on attacks, because it might come into play if any of these creatures are encountered as monsters in their own right, or perhaps as allies of the player characters.


STANDARD FAMILIARS
With the GM’s consent, any of the beasts described in this section can be chosen by a character who casts the find familiar spell. These creatures might also be encountered as the familiars of NPC spellcasters.

CARRION CROW
Feasting on the hearts of fallen evil warriors on battlefields 
has corrupted these crows. They resemble normal crows, but they are easily distinguished by their rust-colored, barbed beaks and a patch of feathers on their breasts of the same color. Sometimes, carrion crows use their mimicry to lure animals and people into danger, in hopes of having more dead meat on which to feast.


Evil spellcasters find carrion crows to be capable
familiars. The creatures are happy to serve a master if they are provided with a steady supply of dead flesh and blood.

Any creature other than a carrion crow within 10 feet of the carrion crow must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened until the start of the creature's next turn. On a successful saving throw, a creature is immune to the shriek of any carrion crow for 1 hour.


CATFISH SHARK
The catfish shark lives in deep water. Most species are 
less than 1 foot long and range from pale orange to silvery white in color. Some are also bioluminescent. The catfish shark is an ideal familiar for a spellcaster who operates underwater.

The goldbug is a strange sort of insect, a creature whose 
round, flat body resembles a gold coin. This “disguise” helps goldbugs get close to their prized food source: gold. When placed in a pouch or chest along with the gold coins it resembles, a goldbug will happily devour the coins at the rate of one per day.


Goldbugs live underground near veins of gold and are
common in areas where gold is used as coinage and in art objects.

Spiked Roll.  As a reaction, a hedgehog can roll into a spiny 
ball to protect its body from harm. The hedgehog uses this 
reaction whenever a creature makes an attack roll against it but before the roll takes place. A creature that attacks the hedgehog must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity check or take 1 piercing damage. A creature that uses a reach weapon or a ranged weapon against the hedgehog is unaffected by this ability.

WHARFLING
Tiny, doglike creatures with slippery, hairless skin and

Variant Familiars
This section expands the roster of potential familiars to 
include several intelligent creatures with supernatural abilities. The relationship between the familiar and its master, and the benefits the master receives, resembles how the imp, the quasit, and the pseudodragon are presented as variant familiars in the standard rules.


If the GM allows the use of any of these variant familiars
by player characters, it might or might not be necessary for the would-be master to start the process by casting find familiar. Either way, a variant familiar is an actual creature (not a spirit) that serves at its own discretion, obeying its master’s commands only when doing so does not immediately bring it harm, and it will not hesitate to end the link with its master as a matter of self-preservation. Unlike standard familiars, a variant familiar does not disappear if it drops to 0 hit points; it simply dies or falls unconscious (GM’s choice).

These creatures can be found in vast numbers in the lower planes, mostly providing fodder for demons and other denizens. Typically, an abyssal worm measures a foot to a foot and a half in length, its body gray in color, with mossy green and mustard yellow mottling. The worm’s mouth is a round orifice ringed with sharp, needle-like teeth. The worm’s skin exudes a slime that leaves a glistening trail in its path.


Evil spellcasters often choose the abyssal worm as a
familiar as an intimidation tactic. The creature’s disgusting appearance makes it an excellent tool for unnerving others, especially if they aren’t hardened adventurers. Abyssal worms are happy to serve as familiars, so long as they get a steady diet of flesh and the chance to torment the living.
Familiar. If an abyssal worm agrees to serve another 
creature as a familiar, it forms a telepathic bond with its master. While the two are bonded, the master can sense what the abyssal worm senses, as long as they are within 1 mile of each other. While the abyssal worm is within 10 feet of its master, the master gains the worm’s immunity to poison damage and the poisoned condition. If its master causes it physical harm, or if it simply chooses to do so, the abyssal worm will abandon its service as a familiar, breaking the telepathic bond.

the abyssal worm doesn't attack. Instead, at the start of the abyssal worm's turn, the target loses 5 (1d4+3) hit points due to blood loss and also takes 1 poison damage.
  The abyssal worm can detach itself by spending 5 feet of 
movement. It does so after draining 10 hit points of blood from its target or when the target dies. A creature, including the target, can use an action to detach the abyssal worm.


ALKONOST
The alkonost is a graceful bird that has the face of a 
beautiful man or woman. Flocks of these creatures lurk on the edges of dark clouds. Their plumage is the color of storms, ranging from light gray to dark slate with a shimmer of green or violet hue on the eldest. 
Familiar. If an alkonost agrees to serve another creature 
as a familiar, it forms a telepathic bond with its master. While the two are bonded, the master can sense what the alkonost senses, as long as they are within 1 mile of each other. While the alkonost is within 10 feet of its master, the master shares the alkonost’s One with Wind trait. If its master causes it physical harm, or if it simply chooses to do so, the alkonost will abandon its service as a familiar, ending the telepathic bond.

An evil drake that resembles a pseudodragon, the 
crimson drake is a popular familiar among evil evokers, particularly those who favor fire magic. An evil warlock who has the Pact of the Chain can acquire a crimson drake companion in place of a quasit, while an evil wizard can procure the services of one through treats and sacrifices worth at least 150 gp.

Familiar. If an infernal viper agrees to serve another

Hit: 5 (1d4+3) piercing damage; target must make a DC 13 
Constitution saving throw, taking 5 (2d4) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.


KUUNGANISHA
The kuunganisha is a type of fiend that appears to have 
been specifically created by the powers of villainy to serve as a familiar. An evil warlock who has the Pact of the Chain can summon a kuunganisha in place of a quasit or an imp, while a wizard can acquire one only by casting a planar binding spell (though the kuunganisha serves the wizard permanently in this case, rather than for just 24 hours). 
Familiar. If a kuunganisha agrees to serve another 
creature as a familiar, it forms a telepathic bond with its master. While the two are bonded, the master can sense what the kuunganisha senses, as long as they are within 1 mile of each other. While the kuunganisha is within 10 feet of its master, the master gains the kuunganisha’s Magic Resistance trait. If its master causes it physical harm, or if it simply chooses to do so, the kuunganisha will abandon its service as a familiar, breaking the telepathic bond.KUUNGANISHA

Fiend Sight.  Magical darkness doesn’t impede the fiend’s 
darkvision.
Magic Resistance. The kuunganisha has advantage on saving 
throws against spells and other magical effects.
Regeneration. The kuunganisha regains 1 hp at the start of 
its turn if it has at least 1 hp.
Will of the Master.  The master of a kuunganisha familiar can 
cast a spell through the creature, using the fiend’s senses 
to target the spell. The range limitations are treated as if the spell originated from the kuunganisha, not the master. The spell effect occurs on the kuunganisha’s turn, though the master must cast the spell during the master’s turn. Concentration spells must still be maintained by the master.


ACTIONS
Multiattack. The kuunganisha makes one claw attack and 
one bite attack.
Bite. Melee Weapon Attack:  +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. 
Hit: 5 (1d4 + 3) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or take 5 (2d4) poison damage and become poisoned for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
Claw. Melee Weapon Attack:  +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. 
Hit: 8 (2d4 + 3) slashing damage.
Invisibility. The kuunganisha magically turns invisible until it 
attacks, or until its concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell). Any equipment the fiend wears or carries becomes invisible with it.


LEONINO
Appearing as a wild cat with hawk-like wings, the leonino 
is a much sought-after familiar by elf wizards, particularly those who have an affinity for air or wind. Acquiring a leonino familiar requires the casting of the find familiar spell, with an additional offering of fine fish and at least 200 feet of dyed red yarn. Once the spell is cast, the wizard makes a Charisma check contested by the leonino’s Charisma check. If the leonino wins the contest, the 
298


WIZARD'S ENTOURAGEcreature flies off and the wizard is hated and distrusted by
all feline creatures for at least a month.
Familiar. I f a leonino agrees to serve another creature 
as a familiar, it forms a telepathic bond with its master. While the two are bonded, the master can sense what the leonino senses, as long as they are within 1 mile of each other. While the leonino is within 10 feet of its master, the master gains the leonino’s Evasion trait. If its master causes it physical harm, or if it simply chooses to do so, the leonino will abandon its service as a familiar, breaking the telepathic bond.

Flyby. The leonino doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks when 
it flies out of an enemy’s reach.
Evasion. If the leonino is subjected to an effect that allows it 
to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, 
the leonino instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails.
Silent Wings. The flight of a leonino is especially silent 
and difficult to notice in forests and urban settings. It has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made while flying in these areas.


ACTIONS
Bite. Melee Weapon Attack:  +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. 
Hit: 5 (1d4 + 3) slashing damage. If this is the first time the leonino has hit the target within the past 24 hours, the target must succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by the leonino for 1 hour.


LIBRARY AUTOMATON
These strange-looking constructs are unusually intelligent 
for creatures of their type and will sometimes serve a lawful or neutral spellcaster (though never a chaotic one) as a familiar. 
Familiar. If a library automaton agrees to serve another 
creature as a familiar, it forms a telepathic bond with its master. While the two are bonded, the master can sense what the library automaton senses, as long as they are within 1 mile of each other. While the automaton is within 10 feet of its master, the master gains the automaton’s 
immunity to poison damage and the poisoned condition. If its master causes it physical harm, or if it simply chooses to do so, the automaton will abandon its service as a familiar, breaking the telepathic bond.

Extradimensional Book Repository. A small door 
on the chest of the library automaton opens into an 
extradimensional bookcase. This bookcase functions exactly as a bag of holding,  except that it can store only written 
materials, such as books, scrolls, tomes, parchment, folders, notebooks, spellbooks, and the like.


ACTIONS
Gaze of Confusion. The library automaton chooses one 
creature it can see within 40 feet. The target must succeed on a DC 12 Intelligence saving throw or take 9 (3d4 + 2) psychic damage and have disadvantage on Intelligence-based checks, saving throws, and attack rolls until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage and suffers no other effect.
Bibliotelekinesis. This ability functions as the mage hand 
cantrip but can be used only on books, scrolls, maps, and other printed or written materials.


LIVING SHADE
One of the rarer and more bizarre options for a familiar 
is the living shade, a fey creature often confused with undead creatures such as the shadow. Illusionists, wizards who specialize in shadow, and Pact of the Archfey warlocks are the most common masters of these creatures. Obtaining a living shade by casting the find familiar spell requires an additional material component: 50 gp worth of powdered jet.
Familiar. If a living shade agrees to serve another 
creature as a familiar, it forms a telepathic bond with its master. While the two are bonded, the master can sense what the living shade senses, as long as they are within 1 mile of each other. While the living shade is within 10 feet of its master, the master gains the living shade’s Shadow

STRYX
Owl-like monstrosities with vaguely human-like heads,  
stryx sometimes serve mortal spellcasters, particularly one 
of elven blood or one who has some tie to the fey, such as a  
half-elf enchanter or a warlock whose patron is the Archfey.
Familiar. If a stryx agrees to serve another creature as a 
familiar, it forms a telepathic bond with its master. While 
the two are bonded, the master can sense what the stryx senses, as long as they are within 1 mile of each other. While the stryx is within 10 feet of its master, the master senses, the benefit of the spell whenever the stryx casts comprehend languages.

ACTIONS

WITCHLIGHT
These tiny constructs that resemble will-o-wisps are 
similar to homunculi, in that they are created (from pieces of quartz) and animated by their creators rather than brought into being by the spell. Conjurers and spellcasters who concentrate on illumination and light magic are the most common masters of these constructs. 
Familiar. If a witchlight agrees to serve another creature 
as a familiar, it forms a telepathic bond with its master. While the two are bonded, the master can sense what the witchlight senses, as long as they are within 1 mile of each other. While the witchlight is within 10 feet of its master, the master gains the witchlight’s immunity to poison damage and the poisoned condition. If its master causes it physical harm, or if it simply chooses to do so, the witchlight will abandon its service as a familiar, breaking the telepathic bond.

Dispel Magic Weakness. Casting dispel magic  on a witchlight 
paralyzes it for 1d10 rounds.
Luminance. A witchlight normally glows as brightly as a 
torch. The creature can dim itself to the luminosity of a 
candle, but it cannot extinguish its light. Because of its glow, the witchlight has disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.
Thin as Light. Although a witchlight is not incorporeal, it can 
pass through any opening that light can.


ACTIONS
Light Ray. Ranged Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, range 30 ft., one 
target. Hit: 6 (1d4 + 4) radiant damage.
Flash (Recharge 5–6). The witchlight emits a bright burst 
of light that causes any sighted creature within 30 feet to be blinded for 1d4 rounds unless it succeeds on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw.


WOLPERTINGER
Woodland-dwelling monstrosities, wolpertingers are 
popular familiars among gnomish wizards but will serve just about any spellcaster if they are treated with care and respect. Since these creatures are more powerful than a standard familiar, 25 gp worth of holly berries must also be expended as part of the casting of the find familiar spell.
Familiar. If a wolpertinger agrees to serve another 
creature as a familiar, it forms a telepathic bond with its master. While the two are bonded, the master can sense what the wolpertinger senses, as long as they are within 1 mile of each other. While the wolpertinger is within 10 feet of its master, the master gains the wolpertinger’s Standing Leap trait. If its master causes it physical harm, or if it simply chooses to do so, the wolpertinger will abandon its service as a familiar, breaking the telepathic bond.

Flyby. The wolpertinger doesn’t provoke an opportunity 
attack when it flies out of an enemy’s reach.
Standing Leap. The wolpertinger’s long jump is up to 20 feet 
and its high jump is up to 10 feet, with or without a running start.

A beast with an Intelligence of 4 or lower that is in the area must also succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened until the start of its next turn.


ZOOG
Alien-looking creatures, zoogs are intelligent and will 
serve an evil-aligned spellcaster as a familiar with the correct sort of inducement (normally the sacrifice of a cat or other feline creature).
Familiar. If a zoog agrees to serve another creature as a 
familiar, it forms a telepathic bond with its master. While the two are bonded, the master can sense what the zoog senses, as long as they are within 1 mile of each other. If its master causes it physical harm, or if it simply chooses to do so, the zoog will abandon its service as a familiar, breaking the telepathic bond.

APPENDIX
Clockwork magic is a style of magic from the Midgard 
Campaign Setting, divinely granted to humans and dwarves by the goddess Rava, patron of industry and mistress of time. 
If you play in Midgard, or if you want to add clockwork 
magic to your game, this category of magic includes several temporal magic spells and some of the spells described earlier in this book. For additional, specific spells to heal or control clockworks, see the Midgard Heroes Handbook.


CLOCKWORK FAMILIARS
A wizard who embraces clockwork magic can use the find 
familiar spell in a special way. A small clockwork device in the form of an animal (worth 10 gp) is substituted for the spell’s usual material component. The device must resemble one of the allowable animals listed in the spell. When the casting is complete, the clockwork animates. It has the statistics of the chosen animal form, but is a construct, rather than a beast. 
A clockwork familiar’s form can be changed by rebuilding 
the clockwork device into a new form of animal and casting the spell again. If the familiar is destroyed, it can be rebuilt (in the same form or a new one) with the same components, if they are recovered; otherwise, 10 gp must be spent on replacement parts.


Clockwork magic Spell Lists
All spellcasters can cast some number of clockwork spells, 
as borne out in the lists that follow. The spells in these lists that carry a “[temporal]” tag can be found in the T emporal Magic section. Other spells appear either earlier in this book or in the standard rules.

APPENDIXThe minotaurs created what they call “labyrinth magic” 
long ago, a result of their fascination with and mastery of mazes. Spells of this sort tend to involve elements of confusion, dimensional manipulation, and the strengthening of the minotaur’s natural weapons. They are rarely taught to outsiders.

APPENDIXThis appendix is intended primarily for the GM’s use in 
equipping villains and other NPCs with particularly vile or dangerous sorts of magic. Although it is possible that some of these spells will find their way into the hands of spellcasting player characters, most good-aligned characters might (understandably) have doubts about using magic fueled by bloodletting, the forces of the Void, or the Elder Gods. How far the GM allows player characters to progress along this dark path is an individual decision, but it should be clear from the nature of the material that anyone who uses these purely maleficent forms of magic must be prepared to accept the unpleasant and sometimes debilitating consequences.


APOCAL YPSE MAGIC
The tradition of apocalypse magic is one road that evil wizards and other arcane casters can follow to power. It also leads clerics and prophets into the service of ambitious, destructive deities.


Entropy is sometimes seen as synonymous with death
and the end of days. In truth, it’s a facet of nature as inescapable as the four elements and the laws of alchemy. Doomsday cults relish the approaching apocalypse, espousing love while threatening damnation for unbelievers; kings and lords threaten to tear down all of civilization just to add a new province to their realms.
Apocalypse magic isn’t widely practiced, because of its 
inherent destructiveness. At the same time, practitioners can be found in a vast variety of situations. Devotees of dark lords, emissaries of hostile interplanar beings, leaders of vicious cults, and a host of other villainous threats might be workers of apocalypse magic.


When and where this branch of magic originated is
unknown. Some scholars see it as the ultimate expression of natural law, while others consider it a divine gift or the manifestation of a chaotic deity’s will. Whatever its source, apocaplyse magic’s potential to harm, weaken, terrify, and empower makes it one of the most dangerous magical arts.APOCAL YPSE MAGIC  SPELL LISTS

Sickening energy radiates out from you in a sphere with
a 30-foot radius. While the spell lasts, the sphere remains centered on you and moves with you. Each hostile creature in the sphere has disadvantage on saving throws against becoming frightened, paralyzed, poisoned, or stunned. Creatures in the sphere can’t gain temporary hit points, and any effect that restores hit points to a creature within the sphere has those hit points reduced by an amount equal to your spellcasting ability modifier (minimum of 1) .

Each creature within 40 feet of the black hole when it appears must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 20d6 force damage and is pulled to within 5 feet of the black hole.

A creature that’s within 5 feet of the black hole at the 
start of its turn must make a successful Strength saving throw or take 8d6 force damage and have its speed reduced to 0 until the start of its next turn. A creature that’s within 40 feet of the black hole (but not within 5 feet of it) at the end of its turn takes 2d6 cold damage.

the spell persists. Each creature that starts its turn within 15 feet of the brimstone must make a successful Dexterity saving throw or take 1d8 fire damage. The brimstone can be destroyed; it has AC 8 and 12 hp. The brimstone explodes if it takes fire damage; the explosion ends the spell and deals 1d8 bludgeoning damage to all creatures within 15 feet, or half as much damage to a creature that makes a successful Dexterity saving throw.

Casting Time: 1 reaction, which you take when you see a 
creature within range casting a spell
Range: 60 feetComponents: SDuration: Instantaneous


Y ou attempt to hijack a spell being cast and redirect it to
serve your purpose. If the spell is being cast with a spell slot of 3rd level or lower, you choose the target or targets for the spell instead of its caster. If the spell is being cast with a spell slot of 4th level or higher, make an ability check using your spellcasting ability against a DC of 12 + the spell’s level. On a successful check, you choose the target or targets for the spell.


Y our targets must be valid targets for the spell based on
the caster’s ability and the range of the spell, but using your distinctions for friendly and hostile creatures.

amber, worth at least 1,500 gp)
Duration: Instantaneous
Y ou blast a creature within range with a beam of pure, 
entropic energy that ages it rapidly. The target takes 4d6 necrotic damage and must make a successful Constitution saving throw; on a failure, its Strength and Dexterity are both reduced to 1. While its Strength and Dexterity are reduced in this way, the creature can’t hold weapons weighing more than 3 pounds, its speed is halved, and it can’t take reactions. The creature’s Armor Class and attack rolls are modified to account for its reduced attributes. The creature can cast spells normally.


An affected creature can repeat the saving throw after
it finishes a long rest, ending the effect on a success. The effect can also be ended by greater restoration, wish, or comparable magic.

sense when it will expire. Y ou and the creature share a vision of the most likely way in which the creature will die. Y ou both sense approximately how far into the future the event occurs. The vision is not a prophecy or a definite fate; life can take unexpected twists and turns. It is, however, the most likely outcome at the current time unless the creature alters the course of its life. The vision can seem to last as little as a few moments or as long as 30 minutes to you and the spell’s target, but in the objective world, the knowledge is received instantaneously.


GRAVE SENSE

spot things and to interpret the sensations 
you’re receiving .

specter, ghoul, shadow, zombie, or skeleton). That creature claws its way up out of the ground and immediately tries to grapple or attack a creature within 5 feet.
The undead uses its standard stat block, but it has only 10 
hit points and is prone until it stands up. It takes its turn immediately after yours. Y ou can use a bonus action to issue a mental command to the undead when you cast the 
312
APPENDIXspell, and you can change the command by using a bonus 
action on your turn while the spell is active. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete. If you issue no command, the creature defends itself and attacks the last enemy that attacked it.

which it crumbles to dust or disappears.

314


APPENDIXAPOCALYPSE DOMAIN
Gods with the Apocalypse domain in their portfolios 
promote fear, judgment, punishment, and the end of all things.


DIVINE DOMAIN OPTION
Priesthoods of such gods consider themselves the messengers of that doom, and they work to spread word of the coming end. Their gloomy, often frightening message makes them unwelcome in many, but not all, civilized places.


APOCALYPSE DOMAIN SPELLS
CLERIC LEVEL SPELLS
1st bane, grim siphon
3rd blindness/deafness, enthrall
5th bestow curse, fear
7th blight, confusion
9th contact other plane, souleater


RANTING RUIN
When you choose this domain at 1st level, you learn the vicious mockery cantrip. Y ou also gain proficiency in either Arcana or Survival (your choice).
CHANNEL DIVINITY: DAMNATION
Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to lash out at those who defy your deity’s messenger. As an action, you present your holy symbol while pronouncing doom to unbelievers. Each hostile creature that can see you and is within 30 feet of you takes necrotic damage equal to 3d6 + your cleric level, or half as much damage with a successful Wisdom saving throw. A creature that has total cover from you is not affected.
CHANNEL DIVINITY: WEIGHT OF GUILT
At 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity to manipulate a creature’s thoughts. Y ou can then use your access to the creature’s mind as an advantage when interrogating it.
As an action, choose one creature that you can see within 
60 feet of you. That creature must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, you automatically know for the next 10 minutes whether anything the target says is true, a lie, or in between. On a successful save, the target cannot be affected by this spell until you finish a long rest. DIVINE STRIKE
At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with necrotic energy. Once on each of your turns, you can cause a weapon attack to deal an extra 1d8 necrotic damage to the target on a hit. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.


HERALD OF THE APOCALYPSE
At 17th level, you gain resistance to acid, fire, and poison damage.


OATH OF THE ANNIHILATOR
The oath of the annihilator is as ancient as the darkness between stars.


PALADIN OPTION
These paladins—sometimes called antipaladins, dark paladins, or death knights—represent the antithesis of the ideal paladin. Paladins who take this oath see themselves as divine instruments of reckoning and foretellers of armageddon. Despite their extreme viewpoint and often brutal behavior, they still conduct themselves honorably and expect to be treated with respect.


Many who swear this oath are devoted to gods of
destruction, chaos, and war.


TENETS OF THE ANNIHILATOR
The principles of the oath of the annihilator are simple. They emphasize the value of strength above all else.
• Extinguish the Weak. An enemy who lacks the strength to prevail in combat must be ushered into the embrace of death.
• Maintain the Balance. For life to flourish, there must be destruction. The strong endure, the weak succumb.
• Revel in Destruction. All things end, especially life. 
Everyone has only a limited time to experience mortal delights, the greatest of which are combat and strife.
• Embrace the End. Death should not be feared. Since it comes for everyone, best be prepared for it at any time.


CHANNEL DIVINITY
When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.
Vow of Ruin. As a bonus action, you can utter a vow 
of ruination using your Channel Divinity. For 1 minute thereafter, successful attacks you make against objects and constructs are treated as critical hits. If your weapon isn’t a magic weapon, it becomes a magic weapon with a +1 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls for the duration of this effect
.
315
APPENDIXWither Foe. As an action, you can present your holy 
symbol and speak a prayer of damnation, using your 
Channel Divinity. Choose one creature within 60 feet of you that you can see. That creature must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, it takes necrotic damage equal to your Charisma modifier + your paladin level, and it has disadvantage on saving throws for 1 minute or until it’s reduced to 0 hit points.


OATH SPELLS
Y ou gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed.


OATH OF ANNIHILATION SPELLS
PALADIN LEVEL SPELLS
3rd bane, proselytize
5th augury, shatter
9th bestow curse, phantom steed
13th blight, caustic waste
17th contagion, hallow


AURA OF INEVITABILITY
Starting at 7th level, you and allied creatures within 10 feet of you are immune to the frightened condition. When you or an allied creature within 10 feet of you takes damage, the damage is reduced by an amount equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1). At 18th level, the range of this effect increases to 30 feet.


ANNIHILATING SMITE
Starting at 15th level, your smites are powerful enough to bring your foes to their knees. When you use your Divine Smite against a creature that is Large or smaller, the creature must make a successful Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.


HARBINGER OF THE END
At 20th level, you can use an action to assume the form of a harbinger of the apocalypse. Y our appearance alters in some frightening way of your choosing. For example, your skin could take on the texture of broken stone and magma, your hair could become flames, or you could sprout demonic horns and a tail. For 1 minute thereafter, you gain the following benefits:
• When you reduce a creature to 0 hit points, you heal 20 hit points.
• Y our attacks and spells ignore a target’s resistance to damage.
• Y ou add your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1) to your saving throws.
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.DOOMSAYER
The magic you seek is as powerful as it is destructive.


ARCANE SPECIALTY
Any fool can learn to hurl a fireball, but only a master of the apocalypse can open a black hole. Some doomsayers use their terrible power to amass a conquering army; others seek to become a force of darkness and to reshape the world according to their own vision.


APOCALYPSE SAVANT
Beginning when you select this specialty at 2nd level, the gold and time you must spend to copy an apocalypse spell into your spellbook is halved.


WICKED PRESENCE
At 2nd level, you gain the ability to instill a sense of impending doom in creatures who witness your power. When you kill a creature with a spell that isn’t a cantrip, you can use a bonus action to select one or more creatures within 30 feet of the creature you just killed. Each of those creatures must make a successful Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you for 1 minute. A frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you 
finish a long rest.


TERRIBLE POWER
Starting at 6th level, whenever you score a critical hit with a spell attack, choose one of the following two effects:
• Every creature affected by the spell must make a successful Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you until the end of its next turn.
• Every creature affected by the spell must make a successful Constitution saving throw or become poisoned until the end of its next turn.


MERCILESS ONSLAUGHT
Starting at 10th level, you have advantage when making spell attack rolls against creatures that are frightened or poisoned.


POWER FROM DARKNESS
Beginning at 14th level, your spell attacks score critical hits when the attack roll is a natural 19 or 20.

APPENDIXBlood Magic
Blood is life, and blood magic is closely tied to the dark 
gods, blood sacrifices, and malevolent casters. Typically, this style of magic is found among vengeful druids, dark magical societies, cultists of forbidden gods, and lone arcane practitioners with a wanton disregard for others.


Blood Magic Spell Lists
As might be expected, sorcerers and wizards have the largest repertoires of blood spells. At the other end of the spectrum are druids and rangers, who have only a small amount of such magic.

The following spells are presented in alphabetical order.


BLOOD AND STEEL
4th-level transmutation (blood)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: T ouchComponents: V , SDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
When you cast this spell, you cut your hand and take 1d4 
slashing damage that can’t be healed until you take a long rest. Y ou then touch a construct; it must make a successful Constitution saving throw or be charmed by you for the duration. If you or your allies are fighting the construct, it has advantage on the saving throw. Even constructs that are immune to charm effects can be affected by this spell.
While the construct is charmed, you have a telepathic 
link with it as long as the two of you are on the same plane of existence. Y ou can use this telepathic link to issue commands to the creature while you are conscious (no action required), which it does its best to obey. Y ou can specify a simple and general course of action, such as, “Attack the ghouls,” “Block the bridge,” or, “Fetch that bucket.” If the construct completes the order and doesn’t receive further direction from you, it defends itself.


Y ou can use your action to take total and precise control
of the target. Until the end of your next turn, the construct takes only the actions you specify and does nothing you haven’t ordered it to do. During this time, you can also cause the construct to use a reaction, but doing this requires you to use your own reaction as well.
Each time the construct takes damage, it makes a new 
Constitution saving throw against the spell. If the saving throw succeeds, the spell ends.


If the construct is already under your control when the
spell is cast, it gains an Intelligence of 10 (unless its own Intelligence is higher, in which case it retains the higher score) for 4 hours. The construct is capable of acting independently, though it remains loyal to you for the spell’s duration. Y ou can also grant the target a bonus equal to your Intelligence modifier on one skill in which you have proficiency.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 
5th-level spell slot, the duration is concentration, up to  
10 minutes. When you use a 6th-level spell slot, the duration is concentration, up to 1 hour. When you use a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the duration is concentration, up to 8 hours
.

APPENDIXBLOOD ARMOR
3rd-level necromancy (blood)
Casting Time: 1 bonus actionRange: SelfComponents: V , S (you must have just struck a foe with a 
melee weapon)
Duration: 1 hour
When you strike a foe with a melee weapon attack, you can 
immediately cast blood armor as a bonus action. The foe you struck must contain blood; if the target doesn’t bleed, the spell ends without effect. The blood flowing from your foe magically increases in volume and forms a suit of armor around you, granting you an Armor Class of 18 + your Dexterity modifier for the spell’s duration. This armor has no Strength requirement, doesn’t hinder spellcasting, and doesn’t incur disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.
If the creature you struck was a celestial, blood armor also 
grants you advantage on Charisma saving throws for the duration of the spell.


BLOOD LURE
2nd-level enchantment (blood)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 10 feetComponents: V , S, M (a container or pool of blood)Duration: 1 minute
Y ou point at any location (a jar, a bowl, even a puddle) 
within range that contains at least a pint of blood. Each creature that feeds on blood and is within 60 feet of that location must make a Charisma saving throw. (This includes undead, such as vampires.) A creature that has Keen Smell or any similar scent-boosting ability has disadvantage on the saving throw, while undead have advantage on the saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is attracted to the blood and must move toward it unless impeded.
Once an affected creature reaches the blood, it tries to 
consume it, foregoing all other actions while the blood is present. A successful attack against an affected creature ends the effect, as does the consumption of the blood, which requires an action by an affected creature.


BLOOD PUPPET
4th-level transmutation (blood)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 100 feetComponents: V , M (a drop of blood from the target)Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
With a sample of its blood, you are able to magically 
control a creature’s actions, like a marionette on magical strings. Choose a creature you can see within range whose blood you hold. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or you gain control over its physical activity (as long as you interact with the blood material component each round). As a bonus action on your turn, you can direct the creature to perform various activities. Y ou can specify a simple and general course of action, such as, “Attack that creature,” “Run over there,” or, “Fetch that object.” If the creature completes the order and doesn’t receive further direction from you, it defends and preserves itself to the best of its ability. The target is aware of being controlled. At the end of each of its turns, the target can make another Constitution saving thro w. 
On a success, the spell ends.


BLOOD SCARAB
1st-level necromancy (blood)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 30 feetComponents: V , M (a drop of the caster’s blood, and the 
exoskeleton of a scarab beetle)
Duration: Instantaneous
Your blood is absorbed into the beetle’s exoskeleton 
to form a beautiful, rubylike scarab that flies toward a 
creature of your choice within range. The target must make a successful Constitution saving throw or take 1d6 necrotic damage. Y ou gain temporary hit points equal to the necrotic damage dealt.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 
spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the number of scarabs increases by one for each slot level above 1st. Y ou can direct the scarabs at the same target or at different targets. Each target makes a single saving throw, regardless of the number of scarabs targ eting it.


BLOOD SPOOR
4th-level divination (blood)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: SelfComponents: V , S, M (a drop of the quarry’s blood)Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
By touching a drop of your quarry’s blood (spilled or 
drawn within the past hour), you can follow the creature’s trail unerringly across any surface or under water, no matter how fast you are moving. If your quarry takes flight, you can follow its trail along the ground—or through the air, if you have the means to fly.
If your quarry moves magically (such as by way of a 
dimension door or a teleport spell), you sense its trail as a straight path leading from where the magical movement started to where it ended. Such a route might lead through 
319
APPENDIXlethal or impassable barriers. This spell even reveals the 
route of a creature using pass without trace, but it fails to locate a creature protected by nondetection or by other effects that prevent scrying spells or cause divination spells to fail. If your quarry moves to another plane, its trail ends without trace, but blood spoor picks up the trail again if the caster moves to the same plane as the quarry before the spell’s duration expires.


BLOOD TIDE
Necromancy cantrip (blood)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 25 feetComponents: VDuration: 4 rounds
When you cast this spell, a creature you designate within 
range must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or bleed from its nose, eyes, ears, and mouth. This bleeding deals no damage but imposes a –2 penalty on the creature’s Intelligence, Charisma, and Wisdom checks. Blood tide has no effect on undead or constructs.


A bleeding creature might attract the attention of
creatures such as stirges, sharks, or giant mosquitoes, depending on the circumstances.


A cure wounds spell stops the bleeding before the duration
of blood tide expires, as does a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check.
The spell’s duration increases to 2 minutes when you 
reach 5th level, to 10 minutes when you reach 11th level, and to 1 hour when you reach 17th level.


BLOODSHOT
2nd-level conjuration (blood)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 30 feetComponents: V , SDuration: Instantaneous


Y ou launch a jet of boiling blood from your eyes at a
creature within range. Y ou take 1d6 necrotic damage and make a ranged spell attack against the target. If the attack hits, the target takes 2d10 fire damage plus 2d8 psychic damage.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 
spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the fire damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 2nd.BLOODY HANDS
1st-level necromancy (blood)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 30 feetComponents: V , SDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Y ou cause the hands (or other appropriate body parts, 
such as claws or tentacles) of a creature within range to bleed profusely. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 1 necrotic damage each round and suffer disadvantage on all melee and ranged attack rolls that require the use of its hands for the spell’s duration.


Casting any spell that has somatic or material
components while under the influence of this spell requires a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the spell is not cast but it is not lost; the casting can be attempted again in the next round.


BLOODY SMITE
1st-level necromancy (blood)
Casting Time: 1 bonus actionRange: SelfComponents: VDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
The next time during the spell’s duration that you hit 
a creature with a melee weapon attack, your weapon pulses with a dull red light, and the attack deals an extra 1d6 necrotic damage to the target. Until the spell ends, the target must make a Constitution saving throw at the start of each of its turns. On a failed save, it takes 1d6 necrotic damage, it bleeds profusely from the mouth, and it can’t speak intelligibly or cast spells that have a verbal component. On a successful save, the spell ends. If the target or an ally within 5 feet of it uses an action to tend the wound and makes a successful Wisdom (Medicine) check against your spell save DC, or if the target receives magical healing, the spell ends
.


BOILING BLOOD
4th-level necromancy (blood)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 30 feetComponents: V , S, M (a vial of blood)Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Y ou cause the blood within a creature’s body to boil with 
supernatural heat. Choose one creature that you can see within range that isn’t a construct or an undead. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, it takes 2d6 fire damage and the spell ends. On a failed save, the creature takes 4d6 fire damage and is blinded. At 
320
APPENDIXthe end of each of its turns, the target can make another 
Constitution saving throw. On a success, the spell ends. On a failure, the creature takes an additional 2d6 fire damage and remains blinded. 
At Higher Levels.


When you cast this spell using a spell
slot of 5th level or higher, you can target one additional 
creature for each slot level above 4th. The creatures must be 
within 30 feet of each other when you target them.


CAUSTIC BLOOD
2nd-level transmutation (blood)
Casting Time: 1 reaction, which you take when an 
enemy’s attack deals piercing or slashing damage to you
Range: Self (30-foot radius)Components: V , SDuration: Instantaneous
Y our blood becomes caustic when exposed to the air. 
When you take piercing or slashing damage, you can use your reaction to select up to three creatures within 30 feet of you. Each target takes 1d10 acid damage unless it makes a successful Dexterity saving throw.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 
spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the number of targets increases by one for each slot level above 2nd, to a maximum of six targets.


CRUOR OF VISIONS
5th-level divination (blood)
Casting Time: 1 minuteRange: SelfComponents: V , S, M (a bone needle and a catch basin)Duration: Concentration, up to 5 minutes


Y ou prick your finger with a bone needle as you cast this
spell, taking 1 necrotic damage. This drop of blood must be caught in a container, such as a platter or a bowl, where it grows into a pool 1 foot in diameter. This pool acts as a crystal ball for the purpose of scrying.
If you place a drop (or dried flakes) of another creature’s 
blood in the container, the creature has disadvantage on any Wisdom saving throw to resist scrying. Additionally, you can treat the pool of blood as a crystal ball of telepathy.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 
spell slot of 7th level or higher, the pool of blood acts as either a crystal ball of mind reading or a crystal ball of true seeing (your choice when the spell is cast).EXSANGUINATE
5th-level necromancy (blood)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 30 feetComponents: V , S, M (a desiccated horse heart)Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute


Yo u  cause the body of a creature within range to become
engorged with blood or ichor. The target must make a 
Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, it takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage. On a failed save, it takes 4d6 bludgeoning damage each round, it is incapacitated, and it cannot speak, as it vomits up torrents of blood or ichor. In addition, its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.
At the end of each of its turns, a creature can make a 
Constitution saving throw, ending the effect on a success—except for the reduction of its hit point maximum, which lasts until the creature finishes a long rest. 
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell 
slot of 6th level or higher, you can target one additional 
creature for each slot level abo ve 5th.


EXSANGUINATING CLOUD
5th-level necromancy (blood)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 100 feetComponents: V , SDuration: Concentration, up to 5 minutes
When you cast this spell, a rose-colored mist billows up in 
a 20-foot radius, centered on a point you indicate within range, making the area heavily obscured and draining blood from living creatures in the cloud. The cloud spreads around corners. It lasts for the duration or until strong wind disperses it, ending the spell.


This cloud leaches the blood or similar fluid from
creatures in the area. It doesn’t affect undead or constructs. Any creature in the cloud when it’s created or at the start of your turn takes 6d6 necrotic damage and gains one level of exhaustion; a successful Constitution saving throw halves the damage and prevents the exhaustion
.


SANGUINE HORROR
5th-level conjuration (blood)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 5 feetComponents: V , S, M (a miniature dagger)Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour
When you cast this spell, you prick yourself with the 
material component, taking 1 piercing damage. The spell 
321
APPENDIXfails if this damage is prevented or negated in any way. 
From the drop of blood, you conjure a blood elemental (Creature Codex, p. 138). The blood elemental is friendly to you and your companions for the duration. It disappears when it’s reduced to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.
Roll initiative for the elemental, which has its own turns. 
It obeys verbal commands from you (no action required by you). If you don’t issue any commands to the blood elemental, it defends itself but otherwise takes no actions. If your concentration is broken, the blood elemental doesn’t disappear, but you lose control of it and it becomes hostile to you and your companions. An uncontrolled blood elemental cannot be dismissed by you, and it disappears 1 hour after you summoned it.


STANCH
1st-level transmutation (blood)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: T ouchComponents: V , SDuration: 1 hour
The target’s  blood coagulates rapidly, so that a dying target 
stabilizes and any ongoing bleeding or wounding effect on 
the target ends. The target can’t be the source of blood for any spell or effect that requires even a drop of blood.


VITAL MARK
3rd-level transmutation (ritual) (blood)
Casting Time: 10 minutesRange: T ouchComponents: V , SDuration: 24 hours
Y ou mark an unattended magic item (including weapons 
and armor) with a clearly visible stain of your blood. The exact appearance of the bloodstain is up to you. The item’s magical abilities don’t function for anyone else as long as the bloodstain remains on it. For example, a +1 flaming longsword with a vital mark functions as a nonmagical longsword in the hands of anyone but the caster, but it still
 
functions as a +1 flaming longsword for the caster who placed 
the bloodstain on it. A wand of magic missiles would be no more than a stick in the hands of anyone but the caster.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 
spell slot of 4th level or higher on the same item for 28 consecutive days, the effect becomes permanent until dispelled
.WEAPON OF BLOOD
1st-level transmutation (blood)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: SelfComponents: V , S, M (a pinch of iron shavings)Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour
When you cast this spell, you inflict 1d4 slashing damage 
on yourself that can’t be healed until after the blade created by this spell is destroyed or the spell ends. The trickling blood transforms into a dagger of red metal that functions 
as a +1 dagger.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell 
slot of 3rd to 5th level, the self-inflicted wound deals 3d4 slashing damage and the spell produces a +2 dagger. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th to 8th level, the self-inflicted wound deals 6d4 slashing damage and the spell produces a +2 dagger of wounding. When you cast this spell using a 9th-level spell slot, the self-inflicted wound deals 9d4 slashing damage and the spell produces a +3 
dagger of wounding.


SEROPHAGE
Some sorcerers are preoccupied with blood, both their own and that of others.


SORCEROUS ORIGIN
The serophage learns early in life that they can exercise 
some control over their own blood, and they harness that ability to awaken the magic that flows through their veins. The dark possibilities of this form of magic become apparent when a sorcerer discovers that they can control the blood flowing in the veins of other creatures, too. Thus 
is born the serophage, a sorcerer unlike all others.


STRENGTH BENEATH THE SKIN
At 1st level, someone who chooses this origin gains control 
over his or her blood flow, directing it away from a recent wound. When the serophage takes bludgeoning damage, he or she rolls a d4 and subtracts the result from the damage taken. When he or she reaches 6th level, the die 
increases to a d6 .


BLOOD FUEL
Starting at 6th level, instead of taking a move action, a serophage can deal 1d4 slashing damage to him- or herself 
and regain a number of sorcery points equal to the slashing damage. Alternatively, the serophage can choose to increase 
the save DC or the attack bonus of the next spell he or she casts by +1 instead of regaining sorcery points. When the serophage reaches 12th level, the die becomes a d8 and the increase to his or her attack bonus or save DC becomes +2.
322


APPENDIXBLOOD BARRIER
At 14th level, a serophage gains the ability to draw blood 
from a creature with Intelligence 5 or higher that has been killed within the last 30 minutes and form it into swirling rings that surround the sorcerer. The number of rings is equal to his or her Charisma modifier.
The rings absorb physical damage. When the serophage 
is struck by a melee or ranged weapon attack, one ring absorbs 1d10 damage from the attack, and then disappears in a splash.
As an action, the serophage can cause one ring to form 
into a magical spear of blood and launch itself at a target he or she selects within 60 feet. The sorcerer makes a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the target takes piercing damage equal to 1d6 + the serophage’s Charisma modifier and must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the start of the serophage’s next turn. The spear is considered a magic weapon. It evaporates after it’s expended. Each ring remains until it either absorbs damage or is expended as a weapon.


SIPHON BLOOD
At 18th level, a serophage gains the ability to siphon a steady stream of blood from a living creature at a distance. As an action, he or she designates a creature within 40 feet; that creature must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d6 necrotic damage as blood oozes through its skin and flows through the air to the serophage, who absorbs it through their own skin. For every 2 points of damage dealt to the target, the serophage chooses to regain either 1 hit point or 1 sorcery point. The siphoning continues, dealing damage and restoring hit points or sorcery points at the start of the serophage’s turn, until he or she ends the effect (no action required), or until the target makes a successful Constitution saving throw at the end of its turn.


BLOOD MAGE
Blood can be a  dark and forbidden source of magical energy for those willing to makes the necessary sacrifices.


WIZARD SPECIALTY
A blood mage powers their magic with the secrets they learn from their own blood. Eventually, they learn to manipulate the blood of others, too.


BLOOD SAVANT
Beginning at 2nd level, the gold and time a blood mage must spend to copy a blood magic spell into their spellbook is halved.BONUS PROFICIENCY
A blood mage has proficiency in Medicine.


INTERNAL FORTITUDE
At 2nd level, a blood mage gains a greater awareness of the blood flowing through their veins and of the heart that pumps it, and some measure of control over both. When the blood mage is subjected to a disease or poison effect that allows a Constitution saving throw to take only half damage, they instead take no damage on a successful save, and only half damage on a failed one.


BLOOD VISION
A blood mage of 6th level or higher can see a moment of the past through the eyes of a creature by consuming its blood. Upon ingesting a small amount of the blood of another creature, the wizard becomes stunned. While stunned, he or she experiences one of the creature’s memories through its own eyes. (The memory may or may not be about the incident that caused it to bleed.) 
Once a blood mage has consumed a creature’s blood for 
this purpose, the creature is immune to further uses of this ability.


ABSORB TOXINS
A blood mage of 10th level or higher can absorb a poison or a disease from another creature, living or dead, and turn it to his or her use. By exposing a fresh wound to a source of disease or poison, the wizard can safely absorb it and store it, dormant, in his or her bloodstream. The blood mage can then inflict the disease or poison on another creature by spitting a stream of blood at it. As an action, the wizard makes a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the target is exposed to the disease or poison and must proceed with any saving throws required.


If the wizard does not pass the disease or poison along
to another living creature within three days, it becomes active in the body, and the wizard must make the first two saving throws required by the disease or poison with disadvantage.


THICKEN OR QUICKEN BLOOD
A blood mage of 14th level or higher can turn another creature’s blood into sludge, hampering the creature, or can thin it out, giving the creature extra mobility. As an action, the wizard can cause a touched creature that fails a Constitution saving throw to become affected as if by a slow spell—or, alternatively, to gain the effect of a haste  spell. The 
duration of either effect is a number of rounds equal to the 
blood mage’s Intelligence modifier. The target of the haste  
effect can intentionally fail the saving throw. 
The blood mage can use this ability once, regaining the 
use of it upon finishing a long rest. 
323


APPENDIXFiendish Magic
Any mortal in the world can be evil by choice, or can be 
forced into performing evil acts. The same cannot be said for certain denizens of other planes, particularly demons and devils. These fiends are not only innately evil—no choice about it for them, no forcing needed—but also the very personification of evil.


Some spellcasters take up the practice of a certain
kind of magic that enables them to emulate or interact with those fiends, or to protect themselves from being annihlated by the evil creatures they revere. The largest repertoire of fiendish magic belongs to evil wizards, but 
like-minded clerics, sorcerers, and warlocks can also traffic in these spells
.

Casting Time: 1 actionRange: Self (20-foot radius)Components: V , SDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute


Y ou surround yourself with a psychic aura that drives
creatures within 20 feet of you into a violent frenzy. A creature inside the aura or that enters the aura must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be overcome with rage. A creature overcome with rage must take its next action to attack the nearest possible target —if more than one target is available, choose randomly. The creature uses a melee weapon if it has one; otherwise, it attacks with any other offensive ability it possesses. If an affected creature leaves the aura, the aura’s effect persists for 1 round afterward. A creature affected by the aura makes a new saving throw at the start of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once a creature makes a successful save, that creature cannot be affected again by the same aura.


If a creature affected by your aura hits you with an attack
that targets you, the creature takes 4d8 psychic damage.
325
APPENDIXAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 
spell slot of 7th level or higher, creatures that leave the aura remain under the effect of the spell for 1 additional round for each slot level above 6th. Also, the damage an affected creature takes from striking you increases by 2d8 for each slot level above 6th.


CHAINS OF PERDITION
3rd-level conjuration (fiendish)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 60 feetComponents: V , S, M (a few links of iron chain)Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute


Lengths of iron chain appear near a creature you choose
within range, possibly ensnaring the target and causing it physical and mental suffering. The targeted creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be restrained by the chains and take 2d8 bludgeoning damage and 2d8 psychic damage. The creature takes this damage on your turn every round that it remains restrained by the chains. On its turn, a restrained creature can make a Strength or Dexterity check (its choice) against your spell save DC. On a success, it frees itself.
The chains remain until the spell ends. If they are not 
restraining a creature, you can use a bonus action to direct the chains to target the same creature or another one, moving the chains up to 20 feet (within the range of the spell) if necessary to do so. If the chains move beyond the maximum range, the spell ends. The chains can be destroyed; treat them as an object with AC 18, 15 hit points, resistance to piercing damage, and immunity to poison damage and psychic damage.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 
spell slot of 4th level or higher, the spell deals an extra 1d8 bludgeoning damage and 1d8 psychic damage for every two slot levels above 3rd.


CHANNEL FIENDISH POWER
5th-level transmutation (fiendish)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: SelfComponents: V , S, M (an amulet inscribed with a 
demonic or diabolic symbol)
Duration: 10 minutes


Y ou infuse yourself with dark power from the Lower
Planes, which grants you magical gifts for a short time. While this spell is in effect, your body takes on minor fiendish characteristics: scales, a reddish or greenish hue to your skin, small horns protruding from your forehead, or other such features. While the spell is in effect, you gain two of the following abilities:
• Darkvision with a range of 120 feet, unimpeded by magical darkness.
• Immunity to fire damage.
• Immunity to poison damage and the poisoned condition.
• Advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
• Resistance to one of the following damage types: cold, fire, or lightning. 
• Resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from weapons that aren’t silvered. 
• Resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical weapons. 
• Claws that grant you a melee weapon attack that deals 1d8 slashing damage.
• Wings that grant you a flying speed of 60 feet.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, you can choose one additional benefit to be granted by the spell for each slot level above 5th.


CLOAK OF FIENDISH MENACE
2nd-level transmutation (fiendish)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: PersonalComponents: V , SDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Y ou wrap yourself in an aura of fiendish power, 
intimidating those that face you. When a creature is within 5 feet of you, it must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature becomes frightened. A frightened creature can make another saving throw at the start of each of its turns. On a successful saving throw, the creature is no longer frightened and cannot again be affected by this particular casting of the spell.


If you deal damage to a creature that is frightened by
this spell, it must take the Dash action and move away from you by the safest available route on its next turn, unless there is nowhere to move. The creature is unable to move toward you again while the spell is in effect, unless it makes a successful saving throw against the spell.
326


APPENDIXCONJURE FIENDS
4th-level conjuration (fiendish)
Casting Time: 1 minuteRange: 90 feetComponents: V , SDuration: Concentration, up to 1 hour


Y ou summon fiends that appear in unoccupied spaces that
you can see within range. Y ou choose one of the following options for what appears:
• One fiend of challenge rating 2 or lower
• Two fiends of challenge rating 1 or lower
• Four fiends of challenge rating 1/2 or lower
• Eight fiends of challenge rating 1/4 or lower
A fiend summoned by this spell disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.


The summoned creatures are friendly to you and your
companions. Roll initiative for the summoned creatures as a group, which has its own turns. They obey any verbal commands that you issue to them (no action required by you). If you don’t issue any commands to them, they defend themselves from hostile creatures, but otherwise take no actions.
The GM has the creatures’ statistics.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using certain higher-level spell slots, you choose one of the summoning options above, and more creatures appear: twice as many with a 6th-level spell slot and three times as many with an 8th-level spell slot.


CONJURE NIGHTMARE
5th-level conjuration (fiendish)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 60 feetComponents: V , S, M (brimstone and a torch)Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour
Y ou call forth a nightmare to serve you. The creature 
appears in an unoccupied space you choose within range. The nightmare will serve you as a mount, in combat and out. The nightmare is friendly to you and your companions for the duration, and follows any commands you issue to it. If your concentration is broken, the nightmare is no longer bound by the spell. It might leave immediately, especially if it has been wounded or threatened, but it is just as likely to attack you or an ally, or otherwise gain retribution for being summoned and bound to your service. If you provide the nightmare with a sacrifice it can devour when it is first summoned, it will be appeased enough to simply return home once the spell ends, without causing harm to you or your companions.At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the duration increases by 1 hour for each slot level above 5th.
DARK LORD’S MANTLE
5th-level enchantment (fiendish)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: Self (30-foot radius)Components: V , SDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
Y ou infuse yourself with fiendish power, which inspires 
your allies and intimidates your foes. While the spell lasts, you exude confidence. Y ou gain advantage on saving throws against all enchantment spells and effects. In addition, each ally within 30 feet of you can roll a d4 once per round and add the result to an attack roll as a bonus action, or to a saving throw as a reaction.
An enemy that starts its turn within 30 feet of you, or 
that moves within 30 feet of you on its turn, must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you. If a creature moves out of the spell’s radius, it remains frightened until the start of its next turn, and then the spell ends for that creature. While frightened in this way, the creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a success, the creature is no longer frightened, and it cannot be affected again by your casting of this spell for 24 hours.


DEMON WITHIN
3rd-level conjuration (fiendish)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 30 feetComponents: V , S, M (a vial of blood from a humanoid 
killed within the previous 24 hours)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute


One humanoid of your choice within range becomes a
gateway for a demon to enter the plane of existence you are on. Y ou choose the demon’s type from among those of challenge rating of 4 or lower. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a success, the gateway fails to 
open, and the spell has no effect. On a failed save, the target 
takes 4d6 force damage from the demon’s attempt to claw its way through the gate. For the spell’s duration, you can
 
use a bonus action to further agitate the demon, dealing an additional 2d6 force damage to the target each time
.
If the target drops to 0 hit points while affected by this 
spell, the demon tears through the body and appears in the same space as its now incapacitated or dead victim. Y ou do not control this demon; it is free to either attack or leave the area as it chooses. The demon disappears after 24 hours or when it drops to 0 hit points.
327


APPENDIXFIENDISH BRAND
5th-level necromancy (fiendish)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: T ouchComponents: V , S, M (a branding iron)Duration: 7 days
Y ou infuse a branding iron (typically one bearing the mark 
of a demon lord or a lord of Hell) with the bone-chilling cold of the Lower Planes and a promise of damnation. T o mark a creature with the brand, you make a melee spell attack. On a hit, you deal 2d8 cold damage to the target and cause it to become branded. The damage can be healed normally, but the brand remains until a remove curse spell is cast on the target, the duration expires, or you use an action to remove the brand. Y ou can remove the brand from any distance, as long as the branded creature is on the same plane of existence as you.
While the creature wears the brand, it has disadvantage 
on any saving throws it makes against spells you cast on it. If you try to locate the creature with a scrying spell, it takes the –10 penalty to its saving throw as if you possessed a lock of its hair or other body part.
MAMMON’S AVARICE
1st-level divination (fiendish)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: Self (30-foot radius)Components: V , SDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
By casting this spell, you tap into the power of greed that 
is Mammon’s sphere of influence, which manifests as a heightened olfactory sense. Y ou can pinpoint, by smell, the location of any precious metals or gemstones within 30 feet of you. If you find anything, you can use an action to determine the exact types and amounts of any such materials. If materials of this sort are completely enclosed by, or separated from you by,  more than 6 feet of earth or wood, 2 feet of stone, or 2 inches of common metal, you cannot detect them even if they are in range.


NEST OF INFERNAL VIPERS
3rd-level conjuration (fiendish)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 60 feetComponents: V , SDuration: Concentration, up to 1 hour


Y ou summon evil spirits that take the form of a swarm of
poisonous snakes and appear in an unoccupied space you can see within range. The swarm of snakes is considered a fiend as well as a beast. It has resistance to fire damage, and lasts until it drops to 0 hit points or the spell ends
.


The summoned swarm is friendly to you and your
companions. Roll initiative for the swarm, which takes its own turns. It obeys any verbal commands you issue to it (no action required by you). If you don’t issue any commands to the swarm, it moves to attack the nearest creature that is not your ally.
The GM has the creature’s statistics.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using certain higher-level spell slots, you can summon additional swarms. Y ou summon two swarms with a 5th-level spell slot, three swarms with a 7th-level spell slot, or four swarms with a 9th-level spell slot.


PLAGUEBEARER
2nd-level abjuration (fiendish)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: T ouchComponents: V , SDuration: 48 hours


The creature you touch when casting this spell becomes
immune to disease for the duration. The creature can still contract and carry diseases; it simply does not suffer any effects of a disease. When exposed to a disease, the creature must make the saving throw required. If the saving throw fails, the creature becomes a carrier of the disease, and might expose others to it per the rules for the particular affliction. The creature under the effect of the spell is aware when it becomes infected. If the creature recovers from or is cured of all diseases it suffers while this spell is in effect, it continues to benefit from the spell until the spell ends.
When the duration expires, the target becomes 
susceptible to the effect of any disease it is still carrying, as if it had just now contracted it. 
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell 
slot of 3rd level or higher, the duration increases by 24 hours for each slot level above 2nd.


TOME CURSE
4th-level necromancy (fiendish)
Casting Time: 10 minutesRange: T ouchComponents: 
V , S, M (an ounce of blood, and powdered 
onyx worth at least 50 gp, both of which the spell 
consumes)
Duration: Until dispelled or triggered


Y ou protect a book by writing a curse in it with ink made
from the material components of this spell. The writing is typically a couplet or a quatrain that warns of the 
328
APPENDIXconsequences of disturbing your property. The curse is 
triggered by an action or actions that you specify (which typically involves someone reading the book without permission, trying to damage the book, or trying to steal it). When the curse is triggered, the creature that did so must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or suffer its effect. Y ou can choose one of the effects described in the bestow curse spell, or you can affect the target in one of the following ways:
• While the target is cursed, it is blinded.
• Beasts are unusually hostile to the target while it is cursed; they gain advantage on attack rolls against the target.
• While cursed, the target is an attractive mark to pickpockets and other thieves, and such individuals will try to steal the target’s valuables when the opportunity presents itself. (Even if in the target’s possession, the cursed book does not count as one of the target’s valuables.)
• A cursed target that either receives magical healing or rolls Hit Dice to recover hit points after a long rest must roll twice and use the lower result.
A remove curse spell ends this effect. Y ou can also stipulate other actions taken by the target that would nullify the curse (returning the book after it is stolen, for example).


WAVE OF CORRUPTION
3rd-level necromancy (fiendish)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 30 feetComponents: V , S, M (a scrap of rotten meat or plant 
matter)
Duration: Instantaneous
When you cast this spell, necromantic energy spreads 
out in a 30-foot radius around you, corrupting what it comes into contact with. Each unattended, nonmagical object within range takes 3d8 necrotic damage. All food and drink in the area, other than what is being carried, is fouled and made unpalatable. Magic consumables, such as potions, have a 50 percent chance of being ruined, but any such item in the possession of a creature gets a Constitution saving throw using the owner’s save bonus to avoid this outcome.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using 
a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the necrotic damage increases by 1d8 for every two slot levels above 3rd.MASTER OF FIENDS
Some individuals are willing to do anything in exchange for power. They delve into forbidden knowledge to expand their command of magic—trafficking with fiends and endangering their immortal soul in exchange for arcane might
.


WIZARD SPECIALTY
Beings of the Lower Planes dangle promises of power as bait, hoping to lure careless folk into their clutches. Some of those who take the bait have a keen intellect, enabling them to use careful planning that circumvents this damnation—or at least delays it. In this way, power-hungry mages strike bargains and increase their magical might with the knowledge the fiends offer. A master of fiends, as these individuals are called, is either a diabolist (one who deals with devils) or a demonologist (one who traffics with demons). Most common folk care little about the distinction, seeing both simply as servants of evil, but the differences between the two are significant. Diabolists are masters of language and context, knowing that the contracts proffered by devils are complex and meant to mislead, and must be read carefully and fully understood so as to avoid any trickery. Demons have little use for subtlety; they understand and respect only one thing—power. A demonologist must have the magical power to compel such fiends to do their bidding, or they will surely be rent asunder and have their soul carried screaming back to the Abyss by the demon. Either path takes a person willing to risk their immortal soul in the pursuit of power, and few dare to do so.


DARK ARTS
Beginning at 2nd level, you gain a bonus spell you can copy to your spellbook at half the cost. Y ou gain a new spell at each level indicated on the following list if you have not already learned the spell. Y ou acquire knowledge of these spells through your trafficking with fiends. 
When you attain the appropriate wizard level, add the 
indicated spell to your spellbook:  2nd level, hellish rebuke; 4th level, enthrall; 6th level, nest of infernal vipers; 8th level, conjure fiends; 10th level, channel fiendish power; 12th level, aura of wrath; 14th level, plane shift; 16th level, dominate monster; and 18th level, imprisonment.


FIENDISH PRESENCE
At 2nd level, you develop a dark aura of either allure or menace. Y ou gain proficiency in Deception, Intimidation, or Persuasion. Y ou can bring this talent to the fore to gain advantage on a single check using the chosen skill. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
329


APPENDIXHELLBOUND
Due to your dealings with fiends, your soul is damned, and 
after your death it is collected by the fiends with whom you bargained. Such creatures do not give up their prizes willingly. Starting when you reach 2nd level, a caster using a spell to return you to life must make a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw. The DC of this save increases by 1 for every five levels you gain hereafter, to a maximum of DC 15 at 17th level. On a successful save, your soul is retrieved and the spell works normally. On a failed save, the spell ends and you remain dead. (The GM can opt to allow either you or the caster trying to revive you to strike a bargain that allows you to be raised. The details of this deal are left up to the GM, but typically such bargaining involves extremely valuable items, magic, and—especially—souls


COMMUNION AT THE CROSSROADS
T radition states that the devil awaits at the crossroads, looking to bargain with those who seek to sell their souls for glory. When you reach 6th level, you can achieve contact with the lower realms  in less dramatic circumstances. For you, any significant liminal space—the threshold between one space and another, such as the edge of a forest, the entrance to a cave, or the doorway leading from a church to its graveyard —will do. In such a place, you can perform a ritual that summons a dark spirit from beyond, a shadowy form that will offer you power for power
. 
When you do so, you can expend a number of spell slots 
(equal to your wizard level or lower) in exchange for a pool of an equal number of dice that you can use in one of two ways. Y ou can spend one or more dice as an action on your turn to heal yourself, regaining 1d8 hit points for every die you spend. Or you can spend one or more dice to boost the damage of a spell you cast. Each die you spend adds an additional die of damage to a spell you cast, of the same size used in the spell (d6s for fireball, for example). 
Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until 
you finish a long rest. Any unused dice in the pool are lost when you rest, and you regain your normal number of spell slots after the rest.


PLANAR DEFENSE
When you reach 10th level, you have learned to enhance your magic to provide you with greater benefit against extraplanar threats. Y ou are protected not only against attack or betrayal by fiends, but by celestials that would see you judged for your connection with darkness. You have advantage on any saving throws against spells and abilities of celestials or fiends that would cause you to become charmed, frightened, paralyzed, restrained, stunned, or possessed by such a creature. Additionally, if you have the dispel evil and good spell 
prepared and a celestial or a fiend attacks you, you can cast that spell as a reaction. Once you do so, you can’t use this additional benefit again until you finish a long rest.


MASTER OF DARK CONJURATION
Starting at 14th level, when you cast a magic circle spell that affects fiends, such creatures have disadvantage on any Charisma saving throws made in an attempt to enter or leave the cylinder by teleportation or interplanar travel. In addition, any fiend you summon with a conjuration spell gains 13 temporary hit points.


Void Magic
Void magic comprises a dangerous offshoot of wizardry that exists in the shadows of the more well-known practices. This form of magic is anathema to existence itself, making it difficult to master and dangerous even to study. Dabblers rarely produce effects more profound than minor injury, property damage, and psychological scars to themselves and those around them. More serious investigations into Void magic can spell disaster. Only alien creatures whose psychology and physiology defy human understanding seem capable of commanding Void magic with relative ease; even beings as anomalous as aboleths respect and fear the power of Void magic.
A Void spell can never be added to a wizard’s spellbook as 
one of the two free spells obtained for gaining a level. T o learn a Void magic spell, a wizard must find an NPC who is willing to impart the knowledge, or else discover the spell written on a scroll, in a captured spellbook, or carved on a temple wall, or find it in some other form of recorded lore. Alternatively, if the GM allows it, a character who sees and hears a Void magic spell being cast can add it to his or her spellbook, using the same rules as for transcribing a spell from a scroll.
Despite the unique origin of Void magic, it still functions 
similarly to other arcane magic on a fundamental level. Void magic follows all the normal rules for spellcasting and is susceptible to dispelling, counterspelling, and antimagic as normal. 
Void Speech. Every Void spell has a verbal 
component—an utterance in the dark syllables of Void Speech—and can’t, under any circumstances, be cast by someone who cannot speak it. The written form of Void Speech is used to create Void glyphs, which are involved in the casting of some Void spells.
330


APPENDIXVOID MAGIC SPELL LIST
Void magic as a practice and form is entirely the province 
of wizards. Warlocks, bards, and other casters seem unable to master the complex language and arcana associated with it, which demands intense focus and study.

CONJURE MINOR VOIDBORN
5th-level conjuration (Void)
Casting Time: 1 minuteRange: 90 feetComponents: V , SDuration: Concentration, up to 1 hour


Y ou summon fiends or aberrations that appear in
unoccupied spaces you can see within range. Y ou choose one of the following options:
• One creature of challenge rating 2 or lower
•  Two creatures of challenge rating 1 or lower
•  Four creatures of challenge rating 1/2 or lower
•  Eight creatures of challenge rating 1/4 or lower
Summoned creatures disappear when they drop to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.


The summoned creatures do not directly attack you
or your companions. Roll initiative for the summoned creatures as a group; they take their own turns on their initiative result. They attack your enemies and try to stay within 90 feet of you, but they control their own actions. The summoned creatures despise being bound, so they might harm or impede you and your companions with secondary effects (but not direct attacks) if the opportunity arises. At the beginning of the creatures’ turn, you can use your reaction to verbally command them. They obey your commands on that turn, and you take 1d6 psychic damage at the end of the turn.
If your concentration is broken, the spell ends but the 
creatures don’t disappear. Instead, you can no longer command them, and they become hostile to you and your companions. They will attack you and your allies if they believe they have a chance to win the fight or to inflict meaningful harm, but they won’t fight if they fear it would mean their own death. Y ou can’t dismiss the creatures, but they disappear 1 hour after being summoned.


At Higher Levels
. When you cast this spell using a 7th - 
or 9th-level spell slot, you choose one of the summoning 
options above, and more creatures appear  —twice as many 
with a 7th-level spell slot and three times as many with a 
9th-level spell slot.

331


APPENDIXCONJURE VOIDBORN
7th-level conjuration (Void)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 90 feetComponents: V , SDuration: Concentration, up to 1 hour
Y ou summon a fiend or aberration of challenge rating 6 or 
lower, which appears in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. The creature disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.
Roll initiative for the creature, which takes its own turns. 
It attacks the nearest creature on its turn. At the start of the fiend’s turn, you can use your reaction to command the creature by speaking in Void Speech. It obeys your verbal command, and you take 2d6 psychic damage at the end of the creature’s turn.
If your concentration is broken, the spell ends but the 
creature doesn’t disappear. Instead, you can no longer issue commands to the fiend, and it becomes hostile to you and your companions. It will attack you and your allies if it believes it has a chance to win the fight or to inflict meaningful harm, but it won’t fight if it fears doing so would mean its own death. Y ou can’t dismiss the creature, but it disappears 1 hour after you summoned it.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using 
a spell slot of 8th level or higher, the challenge rating increases by 1 for each slot level above 7th.


CRUSHING CURSE
Enchantment cantrip (Void)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 60 feetComponents: V , SDuration: Instantaneous
Y ou speak a word of Void Speech. Choose a creature you 
can see within range. If the target can hear you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take 1d6 psychic damage and be deafened for 1 minute, except that it can still hear Void Speech. A creature deafened in this way can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.
This spell’s damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th 
level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).DESTRUCTIVE RESONANCE
2nd-level enchantment (Void)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: Self (15-foot cone)Components: V , SDuration: Instantaneous


Y ou shout a scathing string of Void Speech that assaults
the minds of those before you. Each creature in a 15-foot cone that can hear you takes 4d6 psychic damage, or half that damage with a successful Wisdom saving throw. A creature damaged by this spell can’t take reactions until the start of its next turn.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 
spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 2nd.


GLIMPSE OF THE VOID
8th-level enchantment (Void)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 120 feetComponents: V , S, M (a scrap of parchment with Void 
glyph scrawlings)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Muttering Void Speech, you force images of terror and 
nonexistence upon your foes. Each creature in a 30-foot cube centered on a point within range must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the creature goes insane for the duration. While insane, a creature takes no actions other than to shriek, wail, gibber, and babble unintelligibly. The GM controls the creature’s movement, which is erratic.


ICY GRASP OF THE VOID
7th-level evocation (Void)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 120 feetComponents: V , SDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Y ou summon the cold, inky darkness of the Void into 
being around a creature that you can see. The target takes 10d10 cold damage and is restrained for the duration; a successful Constitution saving throw halves the damage and negates the restrained condition. A restrained creature gains one level of exhaustion at the start of each of its turns. Creatures immune to cold and that do not breathe do not gain exhaustion. A creature restrained in this way can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the spell on a success. 
332


APPENDIXLIFE DRAIN
6th-level evocation (Void)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 90 feetComponents: V , SDuration: Instantaneous
With a snarled word of Void Speech, you create a swirling 
vortex of purple energy. Choose a point you can see within range. Creatures within 15 feet of the point take 10d6 necrotic damage, or half that damage with a successful Constitution saving throw. For each creature damaged by the spell, you can choose one other creature within range, including yourself, that is not a construct or undead. The secondary targets regain hit points equal to half the necrotic damage you dealt.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using 
a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the vortex’s damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 6th.


LIVING SHADOWS
5th-level enchantment (Void)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 120 feetComponents: V , SDuration: 1 minute


Y ou whisper sibilant words of Void Speech that cause
shadows to writhe with unholy life. Choose a point you can see within range. Writhing shadows spread out in a 15-foot-radius sphere centered on that point, grasping at creatures in the area. A creature that starts its turn in the area or that enters the area for the first time on its turn must make a successful Strength saving throw or be restrained by the shadows. A creature that starts its turn restrained by the shadows must make a successful Constitution saving throw or gain one level of exhaustion.


A restrained creature can use its action to make a
Strength or Dexterity check (its choice) against your spell save DC. On a success, it frees itself.


MADDENING WHISPERS
2nd-level enchantment (Void)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 30 feetComponents: V , SDuration: 1 minute


Y ou whisper a string of Void Speech toward a target
within range that can hear you. The target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be incapacitated. While incapacitated by this spell, the target’s speed is 0, and it can’t benefit from increases to its speed. T o maintain the effect for the duration, you must use your action on subsequent turns to continue whispering; otherwise, the spell ends. The spell also ends if the target takes damage.


NETHER WEAPON
4th-level enchantment (Void)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: T ouchComponents: V , S, M (ink, chalk, or some other  
writing medium)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour
Y ou whisper in Void Speech and touch a weapon. Until the 
spell ends, the weapon turns black, becomes magical if it wasn’t before, and deals 2d6 necrotic damage (in addition to its normal damage) on a successful hit. A creature that takes necrotic damage from the enchanted weapon can’t regain hit points until the start of your next turn.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 
spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 4th.


PROTECTION FROM THE VOID
1st-level abjuration (Void)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: T ouchComponents: V , S, M (a small bar of silver worth 15 sp, 
which the spell consumes)
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
Until the spell ends, one willing creature you touch 
has resistance to necrotic and psychic damage, and has advantage on saving throws against Void spells.


VOID RIFT
9th-level evocation (Void)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 300 feetComponents: V , S, M (a black opal worth 500 gp, carved 
with a Void glyph)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute


Y ou speak a hideous string of Void Speech that leaves your
mouth bloodied, causing a rift into nothingness to tear open. The rift takes the form of a 10-foot-radius sphere, and it forms around a point you can see within range. The area within 40 feet of the sphere’s outer edge becomes difficult terrain as the Void tries to draw everything into itself. A creature that starts its turn within 40 feet of the sphere or that enters that area for the first time on its turn must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pulled 15 feet toward the rift. A creature that starts its turn in the 
333


APPENDIXrift or that comes into contact with it for the first time on
its turn takes 8d10 necrotic damage. Creatures inside the rift are blinded and deafened. Unattended objects within 40 feet of the rift are drawn 15 feet toward it at the start of your turn, and they take damage as creatures if they come into contact with it.
While concentrating on the spell, you take 2d6 necrotic 
damage at the end of each of your turns.


VOID STRIKE
3rd-level evocation (Void)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 90 feetComponents: V , SDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
With a short phrase of Void Speech, you gather writhing 
darkness around your hand. When you cast the spell, and as an action on subsequent turns while you maintain concentration, you can unleash a bolt of darkness at a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack. If the target is in dim light or darkness, you have advantage on the roll. On a hit, the target takes 5d8 necrotic damage and is frightened of you until the start of your next turn.
At Higher Levels. When you cast the spell using a spell 
slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd.


WORD OF MISFORTUNE
Enchantment cantrip (Void)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 60 feetComponents: V , SDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Y ou hiss a word of Void Speech. Choose one creature you 
can see within range. The next time the target makes a saving throw during the spell’s duration, it must roll a d4 and subtract the result from the total of the saving throw. The spell then ends.


TOUCH OF THE VOID
The Void exists outside the realm of sanity and form. Creatures spawned by unknown powers and processes exist there, constantly seeking entry into the living, physical world. More than that, the Void itself seems almost alive, or at least under some constant pressure to spread and expand—to consume. Creatures who taste its power expose themselves to its touch, and that touch is corruptive. It bears a taint that seeps into physical, spiritual, and mental being.Void magic is powerful and often destructive, its spells 
reinforced with the blasphemous intonations of Void Speech, and it is the most common way for mortals, particularly adventurers, to have their first brush with the Void’s taint. Lore and knowledge gathered from tainted sources or the mindbending unreality of the Void itself seep into a creature’s mind and soul. Even some places become spiritually polluted if the barrier to the existing world wears thin or breaks.


VOID TAINT
Void taint is a measure of how much the Void’s influence has seeped into and corrupted a creature’s essence. Accumulating too much Void taint causes madness and physical debilitation.
Whenever a creature is exposed to Void taint, it risks 
losing a small piece of itself to that influence. The Void attacks the very reality of the exposed creature, overwriting a fragment of its personal reality with a twisted version. An exposed creature must make a Charisma saving throw against a DC based on the severity of the exposure, as described on the Void Exposure table. 
On a successful save, the creature might be shaken or 
upset by the experience, but suffers no ill effects. Once a creature has succeeded on a saving throw against a particular kind of Void exposure, it is unaffected by further exposures of the same type until it finishes a long rest.

On a failed save, the creature gains 1 point of Void 
taint. A creature can accumulate an amount of Void taint equal to its proficiency bonus + its Charisma modifier (minimum of 2 points) without harm. When a creature’s Void taint exceeds that number, it is afflicted with a form of indefinite madness and its Void taint total resets to 0. T o determine which type of madness emerges, refer to the Indefinite Madness table on the following page.
334
APPENDIXInstead of bearing this scar on its psyche, a creature 
can choose to channel the Void’s influence into a physical 
change, known as a flesh warp. The Void can produce an infinite variety of these effects, ranging from subtle to terrifying; the Flesh Warps table (see page 336) offers a number of possibilities. A creature that has any flesh warp has disadvantage on Charisma checks involving a creature not of the Void for any purpose other than intimidation.


On either the Indefinite Madness table or the Flesh
Warps table, a die roll dictates the outcome unless the GM decides otherwise. Under no circumstances should a player be allowed to choose a desired result.


CURING FLESH WARPS AND VOID TAINT
A greater restoration spell removes 1 point of Void taint from the target, in addition to curing the target’s indefinite madness, if the creature succeeds on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw.


Flesh warps are permanent manifestations of the Void
within the body of a tainted creature and are incredibly difficult to remove. A regenerate spell or more powerful magic is required to rid a creature of a flesh warp.


VOID DOMAIN
Few ever catch a glimpse of the cold immensity of the stars and the Void, and fewer still are aware of the unfathomable powers that call such places home. Those who see beyond the veil of the mundane often go mad as a result of the irreconcilable clash between their conception of the world and the reality of universal insignificance. T o learn what the Void has to teach, one must embrace its utter indifference toward life.
C
lerics who direct their reverence toward the Void 
and what it represents, rather than toward a deity or some other entity of the typical sort, can commit wholeheartedly to this discipline by following the path laid out in the Void domain.

MESSENGER OF THE VOID
A cleric who adopts the Void domain gains proficiency in Arcana and Intimidation.


BONUS PROFICIENCY
A cleric of the Void domain also gains proficiency with navigator’s tools.
CHANNEL DIVINITY: HIDDEN KNOWLEDGE
A cleric of the Void domain of 2nd level or higher can use his or her Channel Divinity to gain advantage on 
Intelligence checks. In addition, the cleric can choose to use his or her Wisdom modifier instead of Intelligence modifier 
when making these checks. Both effects last for 1 hour.
CHANNEL DIVINITY: DARK SECRETS
A cleric of the Void domain of 6th level or higher can use Channel Divinity to inflict madness on nearby creatures. When the cleric presents his or her holy symbol and speaks of the Void, up to three creatures of the cleric’s choice that can see and hear the cleric must make successful Wisdom saving throws or be afflicted with a form of short-term madness. An affected creature can repeat the saving throw
 
at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.INDEFINITE MADNESS

APPENDIXDIVINE STRIKE
A cleric of the Void domain of 8th level or higher has the 
ability to infuse their weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of the cleric’s turns, they can cause a weapon attack to deal an extra 1d8 cold damage to the target on a hit
. For a cleric of 14th level or higher, the extra cold 
damage is 2d8.


BLACK STAR
A cleric of the Void domain of 17th level or higher can use an action to create crushing gravity in a 60-foot-radius area 
around the cleric. The crushing gravity lasts for 3 rounds. All the effects cease immediately if the cleric moves
. 
The area becomes difficult terrain for the duration. A 
creature that starts its turn in the area or that enters it for the first time on a turn must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 7d6 bludgeoning damage and is affected as if by a slow spell until the start of its next turn.


The cleric and up to three designated creatures are
immune to the effect. After using this ability, the cleric must finish a long rest before using it again.


VOID CASTER
Given the nature of Void magic, it comes as no surprise that a specialty of arcane spellcasting sprang up from the study of Void Speech.


WIZARD SPECIALTY
Void casters are a standoffish and secretive lot, prone to delving into monster-prowled ruins and the dark corners of moldering libraries with equal caution; carelessly reading a text that might be sprinkled with Void glyphs can be just as deadly as stumbling into a den of trolls. As Void casters continue to study Void Speech, they learn to properly invoke the words and glyphs to empower a special type of magic that taps the vast potential of the Void.


Some Void casters risk the darkness for the sake of
gaining knowledge or strengthening one’s defenses against 
that which lies beyond. Others succumb to the madness and corruption that Void magic causes and become living conduits for the horrors seeking entry into the world.


VOID AFFINITY
A Void caster can accumulate twice the normal amount of Void taint before being affected by exposure to the Void—and has advantage on saving throws made to resist gaining Void taint.


WHISPERS OF THE VOID
Starting at 2nd level, as a bonus action immediately before casting a spell of 1st level or higher, a Void caster can utter a few words of Void Speech and weave its dark magic into the spell. The tainted spell disorients one creature the caster can see that the spell affects when it is cast. The creature has disadvantage on the next attack roll or ability check it makes before the start of the Void caster’s next turn. The caster must be able to speak in order to use this feature.


REBUKE FROM BEYOND
Beginning at 6th level, when damaged by a creature within 60 feet, a Void caster can use a reaction to bark a destructive word of Void Speech. If the creature can hear the caster, it takes necrotic damage equal to half the caster’s wizard level + his or her Intelligence modifier. A caster can use this ability a number of times equal to his or her Intelligence modifier (minimum of one), and regains all expended uses after finishing a long rest. The caster can’t use this feature if he or she is unable to speak.


POWERFUL ECHO
Starting at 10th level, when casting a Void magic spell that targets only one creature, a Void caster can also target a second creature. Additionally, he or she has advantage on Constitution saving throws made to maintain concentration on Void spells.


MANIFESTATION
At 14th level, a Void caster can choose a point he or she can see within 60 feet and use an action to utter a complicated phrase in Void Speech. The area within 20 feet of the point is shrouded in dim light for 1 minute. Any creature in the area that is hostile to the caster gains vulnerability to necrotic damage and has disadvantage on Wisdom checks. An affected creature that starts its turn in the area or that enters the area for the first time on its turn takes 3d6 necrotic damage, or half that damage with a successful Constitution saving throw (using the Void caster’s spell save DC). Once a caster uses this ability, it can’t be used again until after finishing a short or long rest. The caster can’t use this feature if he or she is unable to speak.


Mythos Magic
The work of author H. P . Lovecraft—the so-called “Cthulhu mythos”—has been a cornerstone of RPG storytelling since E. Gary Gygax immortalized its influence in his “Inspirational and Educational Reading” list. T aking its name from Lovecraft’s famous story, “The Call of Cthulhu,” the mythos has become the backdrop for a subgenre of fiction sometimes called cosmic horror. At the foundation of cosmic horror are two ideas: that the human mind is too tiny and weak to comprehend more than the barest glimmer of the vastness of the universe and the alien mysteries it contains; and that among those 
336


APPENDIXFLESH WARPS
D10 EFFECT (LASTS UNTIL CURED)
1 Barbed Hide. Spiny barbs protrude from the creature’s skin. Any creature grappling the affected creature takes 
2d4 piercing damage at the start of its turn. The affected creature experiences constant pain while wearing armor or heavy clothing, giving it disadvantage on Dexterity checks made under those conditions. The creature has disadvantage on Deception and Persuasion checks unless the barbs are hidden from sight (which might require covering the creature’s face, at the GM’s discretion).
2 Eyeless. The creature’s eyes rot away, vanish (leaving behind smooth flesh), or otherwise become useless. The creature permanently gains the blinded condition. This condition can’t be removed without curing this flesh warp. The creature’s other senses are enhanced by the Void, granting it blindsight out to a range of 10 feet as long as the creature can hear.
3 Gleaming Skin. The creature’s skin takes on a waxy, unnatural sheen. It might be pale, translucent, or even crystalline in appearance. The gleam grants other creatures advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks made to locate the creature by sight. If the creature is in bright light when it is the target of a melee attack, it can use its reaction to add 1 to its Armor Class if the attacker can see its skin.
4 Pliant Bones. The creature’s skeleton becomes cartilaginous and pliable. The creature can move through a space as narrow as 6 inches wide without squeezing (provided the creature isn’t wearing rigid armor), and the creature’s Strength is reduced by 2.
5 Prehensile Tail. The creature grows a 3-foot-long prehensile tail. The creature can use the tail to make one melee weapon attack with a simple weapon weighing 2 pounds or less, or to make one unarmed strike that deals bludgeoning damage equal to 1d4 + the creature’s Strength modifier. The creature has disadvantage on Acrobatics checks.
6 Proboscis. The creature’s mouth mutates into a long, tubular organ like the maw of a mosquito, moth, or worm. The creature loses the ability to speak and has disadvantage on Deception and Persuasion checks unless the proboscis is hidden from sight. The creature can use the proboscis to make a blood-draining melee weapon attack. The attack roll can be made using Strength or Dexterity; a hit deals piercing damage equal to 1d4 + the creature’s Strength modifier, and the creature becomes attached to the target. While attached, the creature can’t attack but deals the attack’s damage automatically to the creature it is attached to. The creature can detach by spending 5 feet of movement. The creature being attacked or one of its allies within 5 feet of it can free the creature from the proboscis automatically by using an action to do so. 
7 Sentient Tumors. Large cystic tumors sprout from the creature’s shoulder, arm, or back. These growths are sentient and emit a weak psychic field. The character’s mind cannot be read telepathically or affected by divination spells. If the character takes psychic damage, however, he or she must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or suffer the effects of a confusion spell for 1 minute. The character also has disadvantage on Deception and Persuasion checks unless the tumors are hidden from sight.
8 Stench. The creature exudes the stink of rotting flesh, acrid chemicals, sickly sweet perfume, or some other odious aroma. Any other creature that starts its turn within 5 feet of the affected creature must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the start of the creature’s next turn. This stink clings to any objects that remain in the creature’s possession for at least 24 hours. Attempting to sell any such object might be impossible, or yields only half the normal price at best. Food in the creature’s possession spoils after 24 hours.
9 Tentacles. One of the creature’s hands twists into a nest of writhing tentacles. Any check or saving throw the creature makes to maintain a grip or a grapple is made with advantage. Any check or saving throw it makes involving fine motor control or Dexterity is made with disadvantage.
10 Tusks. The creature’s incisors grow into enormous, curved and discolored tusks like those of a boar or a warthog. The creature has difficulty speaking and must make a successful DC 12 Dexterity check to cast a spell that has a verbal component.

APPENDIXmysteries are entities so ancient, powerful, and malevolent 
that they could extinguish Earth’s insignificant civilization without caring or even noticing.
With that in mind, this section explores those “hidden 
and fathomless worlds of strange life which may pulsate in the gulfs beyond the stars” that Lovecraft and his contemporaries pioneered in their strange fiction. Herein you will find a host of forbidden secrets and eldritch lore; a clandestine sort of magic that is full of both cosmic potential and horrific consequences, and knowledge of which erodes the sanity of all who pursue it.


ESSENCE OF THE VOID
The spells in this category resemble Void magic in that they harness the power of the Void, but they are not beholden to it. Mythos magic uses the Great Old Ones as a conduit for its power, while Void magic originates from the Void itself (a place of negation and emptiness that devours the cosmos, not an entity).


Mythos spells can be learned by anyone with magical
aptitude—any character who has the ability to cast spells can add mythos spells to their spell list. All other characters can acquire a mythos spell only if they learn it from one of the forbidden and furtive tomes of the Cthulhu mythos or see the spell being cast.
But this power comes at great risk. Casters of mythos 
magic literally exchange their sanity for magical ability. Unless a character is protected by great Wisdom or a bulwark of arcane wards, using these spells will certainly lead to madness.

Spell Descriptions
The spells in this section are presented in alphabetical 
order. When a mythos spell has a verbal component, the caster must utter it in Void Speech.
BLACK GOAT’S BLESSING
Enchantment cantrip (mythos)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 30 feetComponents: V , SDuration: 1 round


Y ou raise your hand with fingers splayed and utter an
incantation of the Black Goat with a Thousand Y oung. Y our magic is blessed with the eldritch virility of the 
All-Mother. The target has disadvantage on saving throws 
against spells you cast until the end of your next turn.


CURSE OF YIG
5th-level transmutation (ritual) (mythos)
Casting Time: 1 minuteRange: 60 feetComponents: V , S, M (a drop of snake venom)Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
This spell transforms a Small, Medium, or Large creature 
that you can see within range into a servant of Yig (Creature 
338
APPENDIXCodex, p. 325). An unwilling creature can attempt a Wisdom 
saving throw, negating the effect with a success. A willing creature is automatically affected and remains so for as long as you maintain concentration on the spell.


The transformation lasts for the duration or until the
target drops to 0 hit points or dies. The target’s statistics, including mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of a servant of Yig. The transformed creature’s alignment becomes neutral evil, and it is both friendly to you and reverent toward the Father of Serpents. Its equipment is unchanged. If the transformed creature was unwilling, it makes a Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, the spell ends, the
 
creature’s alignment and personality return to normal, and it regains its former attitude toward you and toward Yig.
When it reverts to its normal form, the creature has the 
number of hit points it had before it transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess 
damage carries over to its normal form.


ECTOPLASM
2nd-level necromancy (mythos)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 60 feetComponents: V , S, M (a pinch of bone dust)Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute


Y ou call forth an ectoplasmic manifestation of Medium
size that appears in an unoccupied space of your choice within range that you can see. The manifestation lasts for the spell’s duration. Any creature that ends its turn within 5 feet of the manifestation takes 2d6 psychic damage, or half the damage with a successful Wisdom saving throw.
As a bonus action, you can move the manifestation up 
to 30 feet. It can move through a creature’s space but can’t remain in the same space as that creature. If it enters a creature’s space, that creature takes 2d6 psychic damage, or half the damage with a successful Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature also has disadvantage on Dexterity checks until the end of its next turn.
When you move the manifestation, it can flow through 
a gap as small as 1 square inch, over barriers up to 5 feet tall, and across pits up to 10 feet wide. The manifestation sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius. It also leaves a thin film of ectoplasmic residue on everything it touches or moves through. This residue doesn’t illuminate the surroundings but does glow dimly enough to show the manifestation’s 
path. The residue dissipates 1 round after it is deposited.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 
spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 2nd.ELDRITCH COMMUNION
5th-level divination (ritual) (mythos)
Casting Time: 1 minuteRange: SelfComponents: V , S, M (corvid entrails, a dried opium 
poppy, and a glass dagger)
Duration: 1 minute


You contact a Great Old One and ask one question that
can be answered with a one-sentence reply no more than 
twenty words long. Y ou must ask your question before the spell ends. There is a 25 percent chance that the answer contains a falsehood or is misleading in some way. (The GM determines this secretly.)
Great Old Ones have vast knowledge, but they aren’t 
omniscient, so if your question pertains to information beyond the Old One’s knowledge, the answer might be vacuous, gibberish, or an angry, “I don’t know.”
This also reveals the presence of all aberrations within 300 
feet of you. There is a 1-in-6 chance that each aberration you become aware of also becomes aware of you.


If you cast eldritch communion two or more times before
taking a long rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the first that you receive no answer and become afflicted with short-term madness.


EMANATION OF YOTH
4th-level necromancy (ritual) (mythos)
Casting Time: 1 minuteRange: 90 feetComponents: V , S, M (a fistful of grave earth and a vial of 
child’s blood)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour
Y ou call forth a ghost that takes the form of a spectral, 
serpentlike assassin. It appears in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. The ghost disappears when it’s reduced to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.


The ghost is friendly to you and your companions for the
duration of the spell. Roll initiative for the ghost, which takes its own turns. It obeys verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required by you). If you don’t issue a command to it, the ghost defends itself from hostile creatures but doesn’t move or take other actions.
Y ou are immune to the ghost’s Horrifying Visage 
action but can willingly become the target of the ghost’s Possession ability. Y ou can end this effect on yourself as a bonus action.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a  
spell slot of 6th or 7th level, you call forth two ghosts. If you cast it using a spell slot of 8th or 9th level, you call forth three ghosts.
339


APPENDIXGREEN DECAY
4th-level necromancy (ritual) (mythos)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: T ouchComponents: V , SDuration: Concentration, up to 1 hour
Y our touc h inflicts a nauseating, alien rot. Make a melee 
spell attack against a creature within your reach. On a hit, 
you afflict the creature with the supernatural disease green decay (see below), and creatures within 15 feet of the target who can see it must make a successful Constitution saving throw or become poisoned until the end of their next turn.
Y ou lose concentration on this spell if you can’t see the 
target at the end of your turn.
Green Decay. The flesh of a creature that has this disease 
is slowly consumed by a virulent extraterrestrial fungus. While the disease persists, the creature has disadvantage on Charisma and Wisdom checks and on Wisdom saving throws, and it has vulnerability to acid, fire, and necrotic damage. An affected creature must make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a failed save, the creature takes 1d6 necrotic damage, and its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken. If the creature gets three successes on these saving throws before it gets three failures, the disease ends immediately (but the damage and the hit point maximum reduction remain in effect). If the creature gets three failures on these saving throws before it gets three successes, the disease lasts for the duration of 
the spell, and no further saving throws are allowed.


HUNGER OF LENG
4th-level enchantment (mythos)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 90 feetComponents: V , S, M (a pinch of salt and a drop of the 
caster’s blood)
Duration: 1 minute


Y ou curse a creature that you can see in range with an
insatiable, ghoulish appetite. If it has a digestive system, the creature must make a successful Wisdom saving throw or be compelled to consume the flesh of living creatures for the duration.


The target gains a bite attack and moves to and attacks
the closest creature that isn’t an undead or a construct. The 
target is proficient with the bite, and it adds its Strength modifier to the attack and damage rolls. The damage is piercing and the damage die is a d4. If the target is larger than Medium, its damage die increases by 1d4 for each size category it is above Medium. In addition, the target has advantage on melee attack rolls against any creature that doesn’t have all of its hit points.
If there isn’t a viable creature within range for the target 
to attack, it deals piercing damage to itself equal to 2d4 + its Strength modifier. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. If the target has two consecutive failures, hunger of Leng lasts 
its full duration with no further saving throws allowed.


MIND EXCHANGE
3rd-level transmutation (ritual) (mythos)
Casting Time: 1 minuteRange: 60 feetComponents: V , S, M (a prism and silver coin)Duration: Concentration, up to 8 hours


One humanoid of your choice that you can see within
range must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, you project your mind into the body of the target. Y ou use the target’s statistics but don’t gain access to its knowledge, class features, or proficiencies, retaining your own instead. Meanwhile, the target’s mind is shunted into your body, where it uses your statistics but likewise retains its own knowledge, class features, and proficiencies.


The exchange lasts until either of the the two bodies
drops to 0 hit points, until you end it as a bonus action, or until you are forced out of the target body by an effect such as a dispel magic or dispel evil and good spell (the latter spell defeats mind exchange even though possession by a humanoid isn’t usually affected by that spell). When the effect of this spell ends, both switched minds return to their original bodies. The target of the spell is immune to mind exchange for 24 hours after succeeding on the saving throw or after the exchange ends.


The effects of the exchange can be made permanent with
a wish spell or comparable magic.


SEED OF DESTRUCTION
8th-level enchantment (ritual) (mythos)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 60 feetComponents: V , S, M (five teeth from a still-living 
humanoid and a vial of the caster’s blood)
Duration: 1 hour


This spell impregnates a living creature with a rapidly
gestating hydra that consumes the target from within before emerging to wreak havoc on the world. Make a ranged spell attack against a living creature within range 
that you can see. On a hit, you implant a five -headed 
embryonic growth into the creature. Roll 1d3 + 1 to 
determine how many rounds it takes the embryo to mature.
340


APPENDIX
During the rounds when the embryo is gestating, the 
affected creature takes 5d4 slashing damage at the start of 
its turn, or half the damage with a successful Constitution saving throw.
When the gestation period has elapsed, a tiny hydra 
erupts from the target’s abdomen at the start of your turn. The hydra appears in an unoccupied space adjacent to the target and immediately grows into a full-size Huge aberration. Nearby creatures are pushed away to clear a sufficient space as the hydra grows. This creature is a
 
standard hydra, but with the ability to cast bane as an action 
(spell save DC 11) requiring no spell components. Roll  
initiative for the hydra, which takes its own turns. It obeys verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required by you). If you don’t give it a command or it can’t follow your command, the hydra attacks the nearest living creature
.
At the end of each of the hydra’s turns, you must make 
a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. On a successful save, the hydra remains under your control and friendly to you and your companions. On a failed save, your control ends, the hydra becomes hostile to all creatures, and it attacks the nearest creature to the best of its ability.
The hydra disappears at the end of the spell’s duration, 
or its existence can be cut short with a wish spell or comparable magic, but nothing less. The embryo can be destroyed before it reaches maturity by using a dispel magic spell under the normal rules for dispelling high-level magic.


SEMBLANCE OF DREAD
Illusion cantrip (mythos)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: Self (10-foot radius)Components: V , SDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Y ou adopt the visage of the faceless god Nyarlathotep. For 
the duration, any creature within 10 feet of you and able to see you can’t willingly move closer to you unless it makes a successful Wisdom saving throw at the start of its turn. Constructs and undead are immune to this effect.
For the duration of the spell, you also gain vulnerability 
to radiant damage and have advantage on saving throws against effects that cause the frightened condition.


SIGN OF KOTH
7th-level abjuration (mythos)
Casting Time: 1 turnRange: Self (60-foot radius)Components: V , S, M (a platinum dagger and a powdered 
black pearl worth 500 gp, which the spell consumes)
Duration: Until dispelled


Y ou invoke the twilight citadels of Koth to create a field
of magical energy in the shape of a 60-foot-radius, 
60-foot -tall cylinder centered on you. The only visible 
evidence of this field is a black rune that appears on every doorway, window, or other portal inside the area.
Choose one of the following creature types: aberration, 
beast, celestial, dragon, elemental, fey, fiend, giant, humanoid, monstrosity, ooze, plant, or undead. The sign affects creatures of the chosen type (including you, if applicable) in the following ways:
• The creatures can’t willingly enter the cylinder’s area by nonmagical means; the cylinder acts as an invisible, impenetrable wall of force. If an affected creature tries to enter the cylinder’s area by using teleportation, a dimensional shortcut, or other magical means, it must make a successful Charisma saving throw or the attempt fails.
• They cannot hear any sounds that originate inside the cylinder.
• They have disadvantage on attack rolls against targets inside the cylinder.
• They can’t charm, frighten, or possess creatures inside the cylinder.GREAT OLD ONES
“When the stars were right, they could plunge from world to 
world through the sky . . .”
                     (From “The Call of Cthulhu” by H.P . Lovecraft)


Mythos magic seethes with the unnameable secrets of the
Great Old Ones—alien beings from beyond space and time whose warped, eldritch minds are immeasurably superior to our own and whose sinister, loathsome agendas challenge not only our sanity but our very existence.


Many of the spells in this section refer to and take
inspiration from specific Great Old Ones and Elder Gods of the Cthulhu mythos. These names can serve as narrative waypoints as you chart the cosmic apocalypse of a mythos‑laden campaign. In the same spirit of collaboration that fueled Lovecraft’s circle of writers, you should feel free to develop your own Mythic entities.


Some of the Great Old Ones and Elder Gods central
to mythos magic include: Cthulhu, Yog ‑Sothoth (the 
Beyond‑One), Shub‑Niggurath (the Black Goat of the Woods), Bokrug, Tsathoggua, Koth, Bran Mak Morn, Nodens, Nyarlathotep (the Crawling Chaos), Hastur, Hriggala (the Jaws of Vardesain), the Magnum Innominandum (the Not‑to‑Be‑Named One), Yig (the Father of Serpents), and the White Goddess.

APPENDIXCreatures that aren’t affected by the field and that take a 
short rest inside it regain twice the usual number of hit points for each Hit Die spent at the end of the rest.
When you cast this spell, you can choose to reverse its 
magic; doing this will prevent affected creatures from leaving the area instead of from entering it, make them unable to hear sounds that originate outside the cylinder, and so forth. In this case, the field provides no benefit for taking a short rest.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell 
slot of 8th level or higher, the radius increases by 30 feet for each slot level above 7th.


SLEEP OF THE DEEP
3rd-level illusion (ritual) (mythos)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 60-foot radiusComponents: V , S, M (a pinch of black sand, a tallow 
candle, and a drop of cephalopod ink)
Duration: 8 hours
Y our magic haunts the dreams of others. Choose a 
sleeping creature that you are aware of within range. Creatures that don’t sleep, such as elves, can’t be targeted. The creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or it garners no benefit from the rest, and when it awakens, it gains one level of exhaustion and is afflicted with 
short -term madness.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can affect one additional creature for each slot level above 3rd.


SUMMON ELDRITCH SERVITOR
5th-level conjuration (ritual) (mythos)
Casting Time: 1 minuteRange: 60 feetComponents: V , S, M (a vial of the caster’s blood and a 
silver dagger)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour


Y ou summon eldritch aberrations that appear in
unoccupied spaces you can see within range. Choose one of the following options for what appears:
• Two ghasts of Leng (Creature Codex, p. 168)
• One shantak (Creature Codex, p. 328)
When the summoned creatures appear, you must make a Charisma saving throw. On a success, the creatures are friendly to you and your allies. On a failure, the creatures are friendly to no one and attack the nearest creatures, pursuing and fighting for as long as possible.
Roll initiative for the summoned creatures, which take 
their own turns as a group. If friendly to you, they obey your verbal commands (no action required by you to issue a command), or they attack the nearest living creature if they are not commanded otherwise.


Each round when you maintain concentration on the
spell, you must make a successful DC 15 Wisdom saving throw at the end of your turn or take 1d4 psychic damage. If the total of this damage exceeds your Wisdom score, you gain 1 point of Void taint and you are afflicted with a form of short-term madness. The same penalty applies when the damage exceeds twice your Wisdom score, three times your Wisdom score, and so forth, if you maintain concentration for that long.
A summoned creature disappears when it drops to 0 hit 
points or when the spell ends. If you stop concentrating on the spell before 1 hour has elapsed, the creatures become uncontrolled and hostile until they disappear 1d6 rounds later or until they are killed.
At Higher Levels.


When you cast this spell using a
7th- or 8th-level spell slot, you can summon four ghasts of 
Leng or a hound of Tindalos (Creature Codex, p. 221). When you cast it with a 9th-level spell slot, you can summon five ghasts of Leng or a nightgaunt (Creature Codex, p. 277).


SUMMON AVATAR
9th-level conjuration (ritual) (mythos)
Casting Time: 1 minuteRange: 60 feetComponents: V , S, M (a vial of the caster’s blood, a dried 
opium poppy, and a silver dagger)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour
Y ou summon a worldly incarnation of a Great Old One, 
which appears in an unoccupied space you can see within range. This avatar manifests as an emanation of elder darkness, augmented by boons from the Void. Choose one of the following options for the type of avatar that appears. (Other options might be available if the GM allows.)  An asterisk indicates a spell described in this section.
• Avatar of Cthulhu. The incarnation is a deep one (T ome of Beasts, p. 73) that can innately cast command and sleep of the deep* at will.
• Avatar of Nyarlathotep. The incarnation is a dark voice (Creature Codex, p. 73) that can innately cast bane and semblance of dread* at will.
• Avatar of Shub-Niggurath. The incarnation is a goat-man (T ome of Beasts, p. 231) that can innately cast Black Goat’s blessing* and unseen strangler* at will.
• Avatar of Y og-Sothoth. The incarnation is a human with 1d4 + 1 flesh warps that can innately cast gift of resilience* (see page 71) and thunderwave at will.
When the avatar appears, you must make a Charisma saving throw. On a success, the avatar is friendly to you 
342
APPENDIXand your allies. On a failed save, the avatar is friendly to no 
one and attacks the nearest creature, pursuing and fighting for as long as possible.
Roll initiative for the avatar, which takes its own turns. 
If it is friendly to you, it obeys verbal commands you issue to it (no action required by you). If the avatar has no command, it attacks the nearest creature.


Each round when you maintain concentration on the
spell, you must make a successful DC 15 Wisdom saving throw at the end of your turn or take 1d6 psychic damage. If the total of this damage exceeds your Wisdom score, you gain 1 point of Void taint and you are afflicted with a form of short-term madness. The same penalty recurs when the damage exceeds twice your Wisdom score, three times your Wisdom score, and so forth, if you maintain concentration for that long.
The avatar disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or 
when the spell ends. If you stop concentrating before 1 hour has elapsed, the avatar becomes uncontrolled and hostile until it disappears 1d6 rounds later or until it is killed.


UNSEEN STRANGLER
3rd-level conjuration (ritual) (mythos)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 30 feetComponents: V , S, M (a pinch of sulfur and a live rodent)Duration: 8 hours
Y ou conjure an immaterial, tentacled aberration in an 
unoccupied space you can see within range, and you specify a password that the phantom recognizes. The entity remains where you conjured it until the spell ends, until you dismiss it as an action, or until you move more than 80 feet from it.
The strangler is invisible to all creatures except you, 
and it can’t be harmed. When a Small or larger creature approaches within 30 feet of it without speaking the password that you specified, the strangler starts whispering your name. This whispering is always audible to you, regardless of other sounds in the area, as long as you’re conscious. The strangler sees invisible creatures and can see into the Ethereal Plane. It ignores illusions.
If any creatures hostile to you are within 5 feet of the 
strangler at the start of your turn, the strangler attacks one of them with a tentacle. It makes a melee weapon attack with a bonus equal to your spellcasting ability modifier + your proficiency bonus. On a hit, it deals 3d6 bludgeoning damage, and a Large or smaller creature is grappled (escape DC = your spellcasting ability modifier + your proficiency bonus). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the strangler can’t attack another target. If the strangler scores a critical hit, the target begins to suffocate and can’t speak until the grapple ends.


VOORISH SIGN
1st-level divination (mythos)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: Self (20-foot radius)Components: SDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
For the duration, invisible creatures and objects within 20 
feet of you become visible to you, and you have advantage on saving throws against effects that cause the frightened condition. The effect moves with you, remaining centered on you until the duration expires.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 
spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the radius increases by 5 feet for every two slot levels above 1st.


WARP MIND AND MATTER
6th-level transmutation (ritual) (mythos)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 30 feetComponents: V , S, M (root of deadly nightshade and a 
drop of the caster’s blood)
Duration: Until cured or dispelled


A creature you can see within range undergoes a baleful
transmogrification. The target must make a successful Wisdom saving throw or suffer a flesh warp and be afflicted with a form of indefinite madness.


YELLOW SIGN
4th-level enchantment (mythos)
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 30 feetComponents: V , SDuration: 1d10 hours


Y ou attempt to afflict a humanoid you can see within range
with memories of distant, alien realms and their peculiar inhabitants. The target must make a successful Wisdom saving throw or be afflicted with a form of long-term madness and be charmed by you for the duration of the spell or until you or one of your allies harms it in any way. While charmed in this way, the creature regards you as a sacred monarch. If you or an ally of yours is fighting the creature, it has advantage on its saving throw.
A successful remove curse spell ends both effects.

APPENDIXGRIMOIRES OF THE CTHULHU MYTHOS
If antiquity looks upon the stories of T olkien and 
dreams of fated rings, or reflects upon the multiverse of Moorcock’s White Wolf and thinks of cursed swords, then surely the Cthulhu mythos will be remembered for its magical tomes. Described here are three of the most infamous installments in the mythos atheneum: the accursed Necronomicon, Robert E. Howard’s Nameless Cults, and the ubiquitous Book of Eibon. Mythos spells can be learned only from a mythos grimoire like these or through direct contact with a mythos spellcaster—and those grimoires and casters take many abhorrent forms.
With a multiverse-wide perspective in mind, these 
books are considered to be translations of the “real world” originals—which is to say, they come from the alternate-history Earth of Lovecraft’s Cthulhu mythos setting, including elements of Howard’s Hyborian Age. How they made their way through time and space to wind up on alien worlds or your own setting is the stuff of splendidly macabre speculation (and ultimately is up to you, the GM). One thing’s for sure: these tomes are beyond precious to all who hunger for the eldritch knowledge of the Great Old Ones, and such longings aren’t restricted to humanity and near-humanity. There also exist multitudes of odious aberrations, monstrosities, fiends, and worse entities who will stop at nothing to possess these tomes.


BOOK OF EIBON
Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)


This fragmentary black book is reputed to descend from
the forgotten realms of Hyperborea. It contains puzzling 
guidelines for frightful necromantic rituals and maddening 
interdimensional travel .
The book holds the following spells (an asterisk indicates 
a spell found in this book): semblance of dread*, ectoplasm*, animate dead, speak with dead, emanation of Y oth*, green decay*, yellow sign*, eldritch communion*, create undead, arcane gate, harm, astral projection, Void rift*, and any additional spells of the GM’s choosing.
If attuned to it, the book’s owner can use it as a spellbook 
and as an arcane focus. In addition, while holding the book, an attuned owner can use a bonus action to cast a necromancy spell that is written in this tome without expending a spell slot or using any verbal or somatic components. Once used, this property of the book can’t be used again until the next dawn.NAMELESS CULTS
Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)
This dubious old book, bound in heavy leather with 
iron hasps, details the forbidden secrets and monstrous blasphemy of a multitude of nightmare cults that worship nameless and ghastly entities. It reads like the monologue of a maniac, illustrated with unsettling glyphs and filled with fluctuating moments of vagueness and clarity.


The tome contains all the mythos magic spells in this
section, plus any additional spells of the GM’s choosing.
The book’s bearer can reference Nameless Cults whenever 
he or she makes an Intelligence check to recall information about any aspect of evil or the occult, such as lore about Great Old Ones, mythos creatures, or the cults that worship them. When doing so, the proficiency bonus for that check is doubled.


NECRONOMICON
Wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement)


This monstrous-looking tome bound in humanoid skin
has an almost palpable aura of dread. A grotesque and ghoulish face is stretched across its loathsome cover.


The Necronomicon is replete with fantastic legends of
elder magic and abhorrent secrets from beyond. Its author, the mad poet-philosopher Alhazred, is said to have been seized by an invisible monster in broad daylight and devoured in front of a large number of horror-stricken witnesses. Throughout unknown centuries, the Necronomicon was rigidly suppressed by civil authorities and by all branches of organised ecclesiasticism. Reading this dreaded tome always leads to terrible consequences.
Among its hideous contents, the Necronomicon details 
abstract formulae on the properties of space and the linkage of dimensions both known and unknown. It describes the presence of forbidden cults among human beings who serve elder, primordial races and who worship 
unseen entities with alien -tongued names such as 
Y og -Sothoth and Cthulhu.
Despite centuries of repression, a handful of copies 
of this horrible artifact still exist. Each one is a closely guarded secret of its owner, and not all the owners are human or even humanoid.
T o reap the “benefits” of the Necronomicon, a creature 
must become attuned to it and then spend another 19 hours reading and studying its blasphemous text. The creature can then add to and copy the book’s contents, provided any additions advance the cause of chaos or evil and expand upon the lore already inside. (Because of this, no two copies of the Necronomicon are identical, and no one knows what has been added to or excised from Alhazred’s original text.)
344


APPENDIXWhen a non-evil creature becomes attuned to the
Necronomicon, it must make a successful DC 18 Charisma 
saving throw, or its alignment changes to neutral evil.
Unseen forces of evil will pursue any owner of the book, 
hoping to steal it for themselves or for a more powerful master. Once every three days while a creature is attuned to the book, it has a 19 percent chance to encounter or be attacked by a mythos entity or occult adversary of the GM’s choosing. If a creature dies while attuned to the book, a Great Old One claims its soul, and it can’t be restored to life by any means.
Random Properties. The Necronomicon has the following 
random properties:
• 2 minor beneficial properties
• 1 major beneficial property
• 1 minor detrimental property
• 2 major detrimental properties
Adjusted Ability Scores. After a creature spends the 
requisite amount of time reading and studying the book, its Intelligence score increases by 2, to a maximum of 24, and its Wisdom score decreases by 2, to a minimum of 3. The book can’t adjust the same creature’s ability scores more than once.
Abstract Formulae. The Necronomicon contains a 
multitude of mind-shattering evil magic, including all mythos spells and Void spells in this section, all standard necromancy spells, and any additional spells of the GM’s design or choosing.
Eldritch Magic. Once a creature has read and studied 
the book, any spell slot it expends to cast an arcane spell counts as a spell slot one level higher when determining the spell’s effect.
Eldritch Lore. The book’s bearer can reference the 
Necronomicon whenever it makes an Intelligence check to recall information about any aspect of evil or secrets of the multidimensional universe, such as lore about Great Old Ones or the properties of disquieting technology. When doing so, the proficiency bonus for that check is doubled.
Eldritch Guise. While a creature carries the Necronomicon 
and is attuned to it, the creature can speak, read, and write Void Speech, and it can cast semblance of dread (described above) as a bonus action.
Voidmarked. After a creature spends the requisite 
amount of time reading and studying the book, it acquires mental and physical disfigurements as hideous signs of its devotion to the Great Old Ones. The creature gains one flesh warp and one form of indefinite madness. The voidmark grants you advantage on Persuasion checks made to interact with aberrations and on Intimidation checks made to interact with non-aberrations.Thought Control. A creature that is attuned to the book 
and holding it can use an action to cast dominate monster on a creature within range (save DC 18). This property can’t be used again for 19 hours.


DESTROYING THE BOOK
Pages can be torn from the Necronomicon, but any eldritch lore contained on those pages finds its way back into the book eventually, usually when a new author or translator 
adds pages to the tome. It is rumored that the Necronomicon 
can’t be destroyed as long as a spawn of the Great Old One 
Azathoth exists in the multiverse. A short -term solution 
exists, however: casting the book into the fire of a dying  
star scorches all the writing and imagery from its pages and 
renders the book useless for 6d6 + 6 years .


Unsa vory Characters
Every world has an abundance of villainous types that 
stand in the way of what the heroes want to accomplish. Two more examples of that sort are presented below: the cleric who seduces followers instead of saving them, and the grisly wizard known as the necrophage.


LUST DOMAIN
The Lust domain concerns itself with desire, sex, and awakening passion in others. Clerics of lust often seek to seduce others with their wiles, either for their own pleasure, to lure them into a cult, or to otherwise manipulate them into doing the cleric’s bidding.


LUST DOMAIN SPELLS
CLERIC LEVEL SPELLS
1st charm person, command
3rd alter self, suggestion
5th hypnotic pattern, throes of ecstasy*
7th compulsion, lovesick*
9th dominate person, kiss of the succubus*
* Described in this book


GIFTS OF LUST
A cleric who adopts the Lust domain learns the friends cantrip. They also gain proficiency in one of the following skills: Deception, Performance, or Persuasion.
CHANNEL DIVINITY: LUSTFUL DISTRACTION
A cleric of the Lust domain of 2nd level or higher can use Channel Divinity to instill fascination and lust in others. As an action, the cleric speaks seductively and 
345


APPENDIXgazes lasciviously at creatures of his or her choice within
30 feet who can see and hear the cleric. Each target must make a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a target is compelled to devote its attention to the cleric for 1 minute. While the cleric commands their attention, the targets have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks to perceive any creature other than the cleric, and the cleric has advantage on Charisma (Deception) or (Persuasion) checks to further influence their behavior.


LINGERING SEDUCTION
A cleric of the Lust domain of 6th level of higher can keep the targets of a Lustful Distraction spellbound for up to 10 minutes as long as the cleric continues to speak to them.


DIVINE STRIKE
A cleric of the Lust domain of 8th level or higher has the ability to infuse his or her weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of the cleric’s turns, when hitting a creature with a weapon attack, the cleric can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 psychic damage to the target. For a cleric of 14th level or higher, the extra psychic damage is 2d8.


MASTER OF SEDUCTION
A cleric of the Lust domain of 17th level or higher can command creatures he or she has seduced. While creatures are enraptured by Lustful Distraction, the cleric can take a bonus action on his or her turn to verbally command what each of those creatures will do on its next turn.


NECROPHAGE
The practice of necrophagy is similar to that of necromancy, but with a more horrific flavor. Necrophages, sometimes called death eaters, consume the flesh of the recently deceased to steal those creatures’ knowledge and power.


WIZARD SPECIALTY
Adherents of this specialty claim that it is the origin of all necromancy magic and necrotic energy. They view the Negative Plane as a cosmic necrophage all its own, devouring all matter, energy, and life and replacing it with necrotic energy and undead. 
Except as noted, necrophages function as necromancers 
and use the wizard spell list. Instead of gaining the corresponding features of the School of Necromancy, a necrophage has the features described below.


UNDEAD FAMILIAR
When adopting this specialty at 2nd level, a necrophage adds the find familiar spell to his or her spellbook if it’s not already there. When a necrophage conjures a familiar, the creature is undead instead of a celestial, fey, or fiend. The familiar gains the following trait.
Undead Fortitude. If damage reduces the familiar to 0 
hit points, it makes a Constitution saving throw with a DC equal to 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage is radiant or from a critical hit. On a success, the familiar drops to 1 hit point instead.


MEMORY OF FLESH
A necrophage of 6th level or higher can use an action to consume a bit of flesh from an undead or a recently slain (within 1 hour) creature with an Intelligence of 6 or higher. An unwilling target is allowed a DC 14 Constitution saving throw to resist the effect. 
If the target is affected, the necrophage gains temporary 
hit points equal to his or her wizard level, and if the target was proficient in any Intelligence skills, the necrophage can pick one of them. He or she gains proficiency in that skill or, if already proficient, doubles his or her normal proficiency bonus when using that skill. The temporary hit points and absorbed skill proficiency last until the necrophage finishes a long rest. 
A necrophage can’t target the same creature with this 
feature twice within 24 hours. If he or she uses the feature on a different creature, the original effect ends.


FRUIT OF THE MIND
A necrophage of 10th level or higher can use Memory of Flesh to gain information from the creature as if the necrophage had cast speak with dead instead of gaining temporary hit points and a skill proficiency. An unwilling target has disadvantage on its saving throw. 
As with Memory of Flesh, a necrophage can’t target the 
same creature with this feature twice within 24 hours. If he or she uses the feature on a different creature, the original effect ends.


A particular creature can be affected by Fruit of the Mind
a number of times equal to its Constitution modifier. Beyond that maximum, fuerther attemts to target it yield no results.


FEED ON LIFE
A necrophage of 14th level or higher gains several benefits after using Memory of Flesh or Fruit of the Mind: he or she no longer requires air, food, drink, or sleep; gains immunity to disease, to being poisoned, and to poison and necrotic damage; and can’t suffer a reduction in hit point maximum. These benefits last until the necrophage finishes a long rest.

APPENDIXARCANE TRAPS
(1d6) cold damage at the end of its turn, and can repeat the 
saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.


OTHERWORLDLY PIPES
Magic trap (enchantment)


This auditory trap uses otherworldly piping to transform
its listeners into addlepated imbeciles. 
The trap’s insidious nature allows it to be hidden inside 
a chest, behind a tapestry, or even within a bell or among rafters. The only outward sign of the trap is a series of skewed star-like symbols engraved into the trapped room, chest, or object. The functional components (a series of small silver pipes, like a pan pipe, and a small set of magically animated bellows) can be found with a successful DC 12 Intelligence (Investigation) check. Once they are found, a successful DC 17 Intelligence (Arcana) check identifies the trap and the correct method of disarming it: a dispel magic spell (DC 17), which deactivates it for 1 hour. Attempts to physically disarm the trap by tampering with the pipes or bellows trigger its music and effects immediately.
T ouching a trapped chest or object, or the door of a 
trapped room, triggers the trap. When this occurs, each creature within 10 feet takes 7 (2d6) psychic damage and must make a DC 12 Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the creature’s Intelligence and Charisma are decreased by 1d6 each. A creature takes the same psychic damage each round it listens to the piping; plugging one’s ears reduces the damage by half. The effect lasts until the creature finishes a long rest or is targeted by greater restoration or similar magic.


INFERNAL CONVOCATION
Magic trap (conjuration)


An infernal convocation is a way to use a conjuration in a
trap. A powerful caster binds a fiend, which is summoned to a specific site when a trigger occurs. The fiend collects a second sacrifice—whoever triggered the trap—and is freed of its debt to the caster.


The trap is triggered as soon as a creature enters a magic
circle, which can be inscribed on the wall or ceiling, or even woven into a carpet or limned on a cavern floor. There’s no limit on the circle’s size; horrific tales of lairs being encircled are told over campfires.


The purpose of the circle is deduced with a successful DC
18 Intelligence (Arcana) check. It can be disarmed with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check or a dispel APPENDIX D
Wizards and other practitioners of magic create traps that use spells as much as they use physical objects; some of these hindrances have features in common with pits and spear traps, while others rely on a series of finely wrought glyphs or enchanted components that require arcane knowledge to identify, much less disarm. A small collection of these traps is provided here.
CTHUGHA’S CARESS
Magic trap (evocation)
The caress of Cthugha is patient, volatile, and the basis 
of a trap that evokers find appealing. When this trap is triggered by stepping on a pressure plate, opaque smoke fills a 10-foot square for 2 rounds atop the plate, leaving a thin film of soot on everything within the square when it dissipates. On the following round, a flame fills the same 10-foot square and lasts for 2 rounds, dealing 14 (4d6) fire damage, or half as much damage on a successful DC 14 Dexterity saving throw. Creatures covered in the soot have disadvantage on the saving throw. 
A successful DC 14 Intelligence (Arcana) check identifies 
the soot as fire elemental residue. On a check that beats the DC by 4 or more, the character recalls that the substance is highly combustible. Removing the soot requires an action.
The pressure plate is detected with a successful DC 16 
Wisdom (Perception) check, and it can be disarmed with a successful DC 14 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools. Failing this check by 4 or more activates the trap.
FURIES’ MOAT
Magic trap (enchantment)


Wizards of the Northern tribes fight alongside their
berserker brethren, intimately aware of the awful power, and strategic limitations, of a warrior in the thrall of mindless wrath. This trap is placed in a water-filled moat or ditch that is laced with enchantments to drive enemies into an incandescent, all-consuming rage. 
The enchantment can be detected by a successful DC 14 
Intelligence (Arcana) check. Swimming across the water to the other side of the moat without incident requires a successful DC 14 Strength (Athletics) check. On a failed check, the creature is swept under, taking 3 (1d6) cold damage, and it must make a successful DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or be filled with murderous anger that can be slaked only by attacking any creature within reach. While affected, a creature must use its action to attack the nearest other creature. An affected creature takes an additional 3 
347
APPENDIXmagic spell (which renders it briefly inactive). If a creature 
that is not proficient in Arcana gets a failure on either check, the trap is triggered and the fiend is summoned.  An uncommon variant of the trap exists in which a wall of force spell traps both the prey and the summoned creature in the same area.
SEVEN FLAVORS (OF DOOM)
Magic trap (evocation)


The number seven holds mystical importance in many
civilizations, but only kobolds apply that veneration to their beloved art of trapmaking. The creation known as seven flavors is a deceptively simple trap in which eldritch needles spring from seven hidden tubes to strike a single target and release their charge.
The trap is detected with a successful DC 15 Wisdom 
(Perception) check. It can be disarmed only with dispel magic, though it can be avoided or rendered ineffective by blocking all seven holes. Each needle makes a ranged attack with a +8 bonus. On a hit, a needle deals 7 (1d8+3) damage of a different type from this list: lightning, fire, cold, acid, psychic, thunder, or necrotic.


STEP SOFTLY
Magic trap (evocation/illusion)


The dwarven inventor of the trap known as step softly
believed that adventurers are their own worst enemy, and couldn’t resist using their eagerness against them. A room is built with a false floor too flimsy to support any weight above a pit trap and temporarily braced with magic to give it additional strength.
When everyone in the party has entered the room, 
glyphs blaze into view, covering every inch of the floor, appearing to trap the occupants in their spots. A successful DC 10 Intelligence (Arcana) check reveals that the glyphs are used with evocation magic. A dispel magic spell dismisses the glyphs and the magic that supports the floor, causing everything on the false floor to fall into the pit beneath the room. A detect magic spell, coupled with a successful DC 18 Wisdom (Perception) check, reveals the glyphs glowing with illusion magic and a layer of evocation magic under them.


DREAMLESS SLUMBER
Magic trap (enchantment)


Sometimes capturing thieves is more important than
permanently stopping them, and that was the impetus for creating the dreamless slumber trap, which layers an enchantment over a traditional needle trap on a chest or door. The trap is triggered by touching the chest or door. When that occurs, the creature takes 1 piercing damage and must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or fall into a dreamless, ageless, magical stasis. The stasis remains until it is successfully removed by dispel magic (DC 17) or until three months have passed.
The trap can be detected with a successful DC 15 
Intelligence (Investigation) check, and disarmed with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools.


Spell V ariationsAPPENDIX E
This section contains riffs and twists for three classic spells: charm person, fireball, and raise dead. These experimental variations are meant to entertain players and GMs who are more experienced with—or even jaded by—the standard versions. Changes affect both flavor and implementation, so the spells look different when cast, have different power levels, and even have radically different effects.
Each section covers one of the three standard spells, with 
variations on its theme. Some are similar in effect to the original but with altered story elements, and others have more pronounced tweaks to their effects on the game.Variant Spell LISTS
All these variant spells are available in your campaign only with the GM’s approval.

APPENDIXCharm Person Variants
Charm person is the classic enchantment, dating to the 
origins of the game in 1974. Its appeal is obvious: an enemy grants a bit of friendly head start to retreating foes, a recalcitrant informant suddenly becomes talkative, or a town guard agrees to ignore a crime because that’s what friends do for each other. The five variant spells presented here all work on this theme but with differing levels of power and specificity.


LESSER CHARM
Enchantment cantrip
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 30 feetComponents: V , SDuration: 1 minute


Y ou attempt to charm a humanoid you can see within
range. The targeted creature makes a Wisdom saving throw, with advantage if you or your companions are fighting it or threatening it. If the saving throw fails, the humanoid is charmed by you until the spell’s duration expires, until you or any of your companions do anything 
harmful to it, or until it performs a minor favor for you. The 
charmed creature regards you as a friendly acquaintance or distant kin. It is willing to reveal a secret, open a door, lift an object, share food or water, or perform another favor on a similar level. It won’t fight on your behalf, defend you in combat, put its life or property at risk, or threaten or harm 
someone else it considers a friend. When the spell ends, the 
creature knows it was charmed by you .


CHARM OF LONG STANDING
1st-level enchantment
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 30 feetComponents: V , SDuration: 1 day per caster’s spellcasting level
As charm person but with a longer duration. The target of 
the spell remains charmed for one day per level you’ve attained in your spellcasting class. In addition, so long as the target remains charmed by you, you are also charmed by the target. While you’re charmed this way, you won’t tolerate any harm, abuse, or mistreatment being directed toward the spell’s target.BEDAZZLING CHARM
2nd-level enchantment
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 30 feetComponents: V , SDuration: 1 minute


Y ou attempt to charm a humanoid you can see within
range. It makes a Wisdom saving throw, with advantage if you or your companions are fighting it or threatening it. If the saving throw fails, the humanoid is charmed by a third humanoid you designate that both of you can see. The spell ends after 1 minute, when you or any of your companions do anything harmful to either of the spell’s targets, or when the third humanoid disappears from the charmed creature’s sight. The charmed creature regards the third creature as a friendly acquaintance and will follow it to keep it within sight. When the spell ends, the creature knows it was bedazzled by you to regard the third creature favorably.


CHARM OF GREAT FONDNESS
2nd-level enchantment
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 30 feetComponents: V , SDuration: 1 hour


Y ou attempt to charm a humanoid you can see within
range. It makes a Wisdom saving throw, with advantage if you or your companions are fighting it or if you are not the same species as the target. If the saving throw fails, the targeted humanoid becomes quite fond of you until the duration expires or until you or any of your companions do anything harmful to it. The charmed creature regards you as a potential romantic partner and seeks to attract you in whatever manner is most appropriate to it. It might tell you jokes or clown around, give you a (modest) gift, flirt gently, flex its muscles and demonstrate its athletic prowess, or compose a love poem to you. When the spell ends, the creature knows it was charmed by you.
At Higher Levels . When you cast this spell using a spell 
slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional 
creature for each slot level above 2nd. The creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them. If two or more creatures fail their saving throws, they fall to bickering between themselves over who is more worthy of your affection.
350


APPENDIXMOONLIGHT CHARM
5th-level enchantment
Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 30 feetComponents: V , SDuration: Up to 1 month


Y ou attempt to charm a humanoid you can see within
range. It makes a Wisdom saving throw, with advantage if you or your companions are fighting it or threatening it. If the saving throw fails, the humanoid remains charmed until the spell’s duration expires, until you or any of your companions do anything harmful to it, or until a full moon rises in the sky. The charmed creature regards you as a friendly acquaintance. When the spell ends, the creature knows it was charmed by you.


Raise Dead Variants
Raise dead is another spell with roots in the earliest days of RPGs. The variants here are twisted, limited, or expanded in several ways. They all return a creature to life but in unexpected ways: as ghosts, for a short period, without memories or skills, or under a particular compulsion.


CHARACTER AND EFFECT CHANGES
Two aspects of raise dead are easy to change: the raised creature’s appearance and the traumatic effect of returning to life. The Raise Dead Random Effects table offers a dozen options for reskinning raise dead in random ways. When the spell is cast, roll a d12 or choose the option that best suits the situation or the caster. This change need not be a one-time thing; it can be emblematic of that caster, as recognizably personal as a signature, a catchphrase, or a coat of arms.


RAISE GHOST
3rd-level necromancy
Casting Time: 1 hourRange: T ouchComponents: V , S, M (a diamond worth at least 500 gp, 
which the spell consumes)
Duration: Instantaneous


Y ou return a dead creature you touch to a ghostly and
incorporeal form, provided it has been dead no longer than 10 days. The creature can see and hear, and it can speak in a hollow, sepulchral tone if it chooses to. Whether it’s willing to speak to you depends on its whim and its prior relationship with you, if any.
The affected creature is not undead; it is alive but 
incorporeal, with 1 hit point. It can’t interact with the physical world, attack or cause damage, or cast spells. It is immune to nonmagical damage. It can move through creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain, but it takes 1d10 force damage if it ends its turn inside an object. It regains hit points normally through resting or spending hit dice but never recovers hit points via magic spells, items, or potions.


This spell also neutralizes any poison and cures
nonmagical diseases that affected the creature at the time it died. This spell doesn’t remove magical diseases, curses, or similar effects; if these aren’t removed prior to casting the spell, they take effect when the creature returns to life. The spell also closes mortal wounds, but it doesn’t restore missing body parts. If the creature is lacking body parts or organs integral for its survival—its head, for instance—the spell automatically fails.
Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The target has a 
−4 penalty to saving throws and ability checks. Every time the target finishes a long rest, the penalty is reduced by 1 until it disappears.
A creature affected by raise ghost is restored to normal, 
physical life by raise dead or comparable magic.  Raise ghost has no effect if cast on an undead creature.


RAISE HERO
4th-level necromancy
Casting Time: 1 hourRange: T ouchComponents: V , S, M (a diamond worth at least 500 gp, 
which the spell consumes)
Duration: 24 hours


This spell is identical to raise dead in every way except
duration; the creature is restored to life for only 24 hours. The spell can be recast on the same creature, but on the second and subsequent castings, the caster must roll a d20. If the roll equals or is less than the number of prior castings on the same creature, the spell fails and cannot affect that creature again. Each new casting resets the clock to 24 hours; it doesn’t stack another 24 hours onto a previous casting.

351


APPENDIXRAISE SHADE
4th-level necromancy
Casting Time: 1 hourRange: T ouchComponents: V , S, M (a diamond worth at least 500 gp, 
which the spell consumes)
Duration: Instantaneous
This spell is identical to raise ghost in every way, except 
the ghostly figure can manipulate, hold, or carry objects weighing up to 5 pounds. Note that while 5 pounds of force is enough to pick up many melee weapons, it’s not sufficient to wield one in combat, or to draw a bow.RAISE NEMESIS
5th-level necromancy
Casting Time: 1 hourRange: T ouchComponents: V , S, M (a diamond worth at least 500 gp, 
which the spell consumes)
Duration: Instantaneous
This spell is identical to raise dead, except it simultaneously 
raises two creatures with opposite alignments. For example, if you raise a Lawful Good paladin, then somewhere nearby, a Chaotic Evil warrior of similar power also returns to life. The second corpse must be within 100 miles. The two raised creatures have a vague sense of the direction and distance to their nemesis. They aren’t compelled to battle one another or even to seek each 
 RAISE DEAD RANDOM EFFECTS
D12 EFFECT
1 Nimbus. The target is surrounded by a glow or halo equivalent to faerie fire.
2 Thundercrack. When raise dead is cast, the target’s return to life is heralded by a crack of thunder and a stroke of 
lightning. These can be heard and seen for at least a mile and may be accompanied by a sudden, brief storm.
3 Neophyte. The raised creature forgets one language, one spell or feat, one friend, and one class ability. These memories return in a random sequence at a rate of one per week until all are recovered.
4 Exhaustion. Restoring a soul is as debilitating on the caster as on the dead. The caster suffers the same penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks as the raised creature.
5 Voice of the Afterlife. The raised creature gained subconscious knowledge of a distant plane during its sojourn in the realm of the dead. It now speaks either Abyssal, Celestial, Infernal, Satarre, or Umbral (player’s choice).
6 Breath of Life. The caster absorbs one magical disease, curse, or similar effect from the target creature into him- or herself. The affliction ends on the newly-raised creature but takes full effect on the caster, who must get it cured or removed by standard means.
7 Gravetouched. The raised creature has an uncanny voice or appearance that frightens nonhostile animals (including mounts), children, and even adults unaccustomed to such things. Charisma (Intimidation) checks are made with advantage.
8 Raging Spirit. The raised creature returns to life in the grip of intense and uncontrollable rage. It immediately attacks the caster and anyone else nearby, including friends, acolytes, etc. This anger ends when the creature becomes unconscious or when it’s affected by calm emotions or comparable magic.
9 Mild Spirit. The raised creature returns to life possessed of a gentle kindness. It refuses to fight, argue, or even defend itself for a period of 1d6 + 1 days. This unnatural calm can be removed by a calm emotions spell. It also ends if the 
creature is rendered unconscious by an attack.
10 Altered Spirit. The raised creature returns to life with a random alignment different from its previous one. This lasts for 1d6 + 1 days. The creature’s alignment returns to normal if the creature is affected by a remove curse spell or if it’s 
rendered unconscious by an attack.
11 Armor of the Planes. The raised creature gains resistance to necrotic, fire, cold, or lightning damage for seven days (caster’s choice).
12 Servitor. The raised creature is charmed by the caster. While charmed in this way, the creature serves the caster loyally as repayment for restoring him or her to life. The length of this service is determined by the caster’s spellcasting level: up to level 11 = one week; level 12 to 14 = two weeks; level 15 or higher = one year. The effect is broken if the caster or the caster’s companions cause direct harm to the charmed creature or its loved ones.
352
APPENDIXother out. Their lives are, however, inextricably bound 
together in such a way that if either of them dies, the other also drops dead instantly.


Evil NPCs brought back with raise nemesis typically see it
as an opportunity to create every sort of trouble imaginable.
If the spell is cast on a creature of true Neutral alignment, 
only that creature is restored to life.


RAISE ELDER
6th-level necromancy
Casting Time: 1 hourRange: T ouchComponents: V , S, M (a diamond worth at least 1,000 
gp, which the spell consumes)
Duration: Instantaneous
This spell is identical to raise dead, but it works only on a 
creature that died of old age. The spell grants the raised elder one additional year of life. The raised creature has entirely white hair, its eyes are weak, and it loses 2 points each from Strength and Constitution; no magic less potent than a wish can restore these lost points. In all other respects, the creature can live out its life normally until the added year elapses.
Raise elder has no effect if it’s cast on the same creature a 
second time.


RAISE QUESTING DEAD
6th-level necromancy
Casting Time: 1 hourRange: T ouchComponents: V , S, M (a diamond worth at least 500 gp, 
which the spell consumes)
Duration: Instantaneous
This spell is identical to raise dead, except it empowers you 
to impose a geas on the creature you raise. The targeted soul can opt to decline the geas, in which case it isn’t restored to life. If the creature accepts your geas, it must complete the task within 30 days. If it accepts but fails to meet the conditions of the geas, it dies on the dawn of the 31st day and its spirit again departs the mortal world. If it accomplishes the task, it’s free to live out the remainder of its restored life as it chooses.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell 
slot of 7th or 8th level, the creature has a year to fulfill its geas, allowing for much more complex demands. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 9th level, the geas lasts until it’s fulfilled, no matter how long that takes, or until it’s ended by remove curse, greater restoration, or wish.Fireball Variants
Fireball is perhaps the most iconic damage-dealing spell in fantasy RPGs, so why mess with it? Partly to add an interesting twist to something familiar, partly to give it a story or character spin, and partly just for fun. Here are three options to consider for variant fireballs used by your PC or NPC casters.


APPEARANCE AND TYPE CHANGES
Fireball can be easily spiced up by changing its appearance and damage type. The following table offers twenty options for reskinning fireball; roll a d20 or choose the options that best suit the character who’s casting the spell. The new appearance can become emblematic of that caster, as personal as a signature, a catchphrase, or a distinctive facial feature.


All items created by a variant appearance vanish as soon
as their damage is done; no items or materials can be recovered.

APPENDIXPOWER CHANGES
Fireball is an instantaneous spell, but it might just as easily 
resemble heat metal, with a round of warning, a round of damage, and a round of additional damage. Spreading out the damage this way could be called a slow-burn fireball. Though this is a bit more bookkeeping, such a spell would be appropriate for limited use by a pyromaniacal spellcasting NPC.
While fireball is an area of effect spell, a smaller version 
could attack a single target. This might be called solitary fireball, and could easily find a place in an elementalist’s spellbook or in the hands of a fire imp or an efreet.
Finally, the third variant here is a bouncing fireball, which 
(as the name implies) strikes one location, then bounces according to the caster’s direction to a second location and explodes again. This is similar to how chain lightning works, but bouncing fireball attacks multiple targets in both locations. The tradeoff is lower damage against each creature when compared to chain lightning.


SOLITARY FIREBALL
2nd-level evocation
Range: 150 feetCasting Time: 1 actionDuration: InstantaneousComponents: V , S, M (a candle and a pinch of sulfur)


A bright streak flashes from your pointing finger to a
point you choose within range, where it blossoms with a low roar to engulf a single creature in searing flame. That creature takes 6d6 fire damage, or half damage with a successful Dexterity saving throw. Solitary fireball does not ignite other flammable objects.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 
spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 2nd.


SLOW-BURN FIREBALL
3rd-level evocation
Range: 150 feetCasting Time: 1 actionDuration: 3 roundsComponents: V , S, M (small chunks of coal and sulfur)


A bright streak flashes from your pointing finger to a
point you choose within range, where it slowly ignites the air itself with phlogiston. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere around the target point takes 4d6 fire damage, or half damage with a successful Dexterity saving throw. Every target that takes damage takes the same amount of damage again at the start of your next two turns unless it uses an action to put out the flames on its clothing, hair, and other accoutrements. Flammable objects in the area that aren’t being worn or carried are also ignited.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 
spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.


BOUNCING FIREBALL
6th-level evocation
Range: 150 feetCasting Time: 1 actionDuration: InstantaneousComponents: V , S, M (a tiny ball of bat guano and sulfur, 
and three iron pins)


A bolt of flame streaks from your finger toward a point
you choose within range, then explodes into an inferno of flame. Each creature within 20 feet of the explosion takes 7d6 fire damage, or half damage with a successful Dexterity saving throw.
Immediately afterward, a second bolt of flame streaks 
from that explosion to a second target point you can see exactly 40 feet from the first explosion. It explodes again at the second target point, causing another 7d6 fire damage (halved by a successful Dexterity saving throw). Then the flame jumps instantly again to a third target point, also within your line of sight and exactly 40 feet from the second explosion, where it detonates for the final time with identical results.
Note that for the second and third bursts, the flame 
jumps exactly 40 feet—never more, never less—and if any part of a burst area overlaps the area of a previous burst, the burst fails to happen and the spell ends immediately.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this 
spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 6th.

MIDGARD WORLDBOOK
It is an age of war. Civilization slowly gives way to 
encroaching wilderness, and once-mighty empires  
now lie beneath the waves. Only magic and the warmth  of hope keeps lights aglow when dread things prowl,  and priestly wardings are bent by demonic rage.
The omens are dire. The roads to the shadow realm  
are open again, and the fey have returned to claim their ancient tribute. In the north the giants prepare for Ragnarok, while the goblins in the west grow restless.  In the Crossroads, the shadow of the vampire princes falls across the land. The World Serpent is stirring—and not even all-knowing Baba Y aga can say what will happen next.
Now more than ever, Midgard needs heroes to stand against 
the dark, driving it back with spell, steel, and cunning!
