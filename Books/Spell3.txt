DEEP MAGIC VOLUME 2Using this Book
Written for players and game masters (GMs) alike, this 
book offers an abundance of options to expand magic in your world and spellcasting characters. For players, this book contains a new spellcasting base class, new subclasses for spellcasting classes, and new backgrounds for adding a magical flare to your favorite spellcasting character or creating your new favorite spellcaster. For game masters, this book includes new downtime options, guidance on making your worlds feel more magical, locales and adventure hooks for magical encounters, and spells for rewarding the spellcasters in your party. If you are a player reading this book, be sure to check with your game master before selecting any of the options in this book to confirm they fit within the campaign.


A WIDE VARIETY OF SPELLS
This book presents a wide variety of new choices, but it is important to remember everything is optional. Players, with the guidance of their game masters, are welcome to choose the options, from subclasses to spells, that best fit their campaigns and the styles of characters they want to play. For game masters hesitant to open the doors wide, some of the options in this book can be given to players and their characters as unique rewards over the course of a campaign. For example, the characters could find a spellbook that contains some of the spells listed in Chapter 5, the rogue dabbling in magic could meet a witch and want to learn some tricks of that trade, or the wizard could try out one of the magical styles to get a taste of a few of the new spells contained within this book.


However you decide to use the options presented in
this book, you will need the core rules of the 5th edition of the world’s first roleplaying game, as much of the material in this book relies on those rules. The rules can be found online in the System Reference Document 5.1 or in your local game store or bookstore. Spell and magic item names which appear in italics without a page or book reference can be found in those rulebooks or in the System Reference Document 5.1. 

WHAT’S IN THE BOOK?
Chapter 1 offers the witch base class, over a dozen new 
subclasses, and several new backgrounds. 
Chapter 2 presents 14 new styles, which includes unique 
ways of using spells and new magical grimoires themed 
after each style.
Chapter 3 gives guidance on using magic in your world, 
customizing your spells, and new downtime options. 
Chapter 4 details the spell lists for each spellcasting class. 
Chapter 5 contains over 400 new spells for use in your 
game as a player or as a game master rewarding players 
with magical scrolls and spellbooks in their adventures. 
Appendices include new spellcasting NPCs, arcane 
adventure sites, tables for inspiring magical adventures, and guidance for converting the spells in this book to be compatible with the Core Fantasy Roleplaying rules. MAKE MAGIC YOURS
Magic is the heart of the fantasy genre, and if you, dear reader, are anything like me, that same magic also holds a special place in your own heart. The first tabletop character I ever played was a wizard, and from the moment I slung my first magic missile, I knew I had unlocked a world of imagination that would define the rest of my life. Little has changed on that front over the past decades, except now I have the ultimate joy of working alongside a team of like-minded dreamers who make even more magic to share with readers like you.


The Deep Magic series has a long and storied history that
we are thrilled to continue here. Whether amongst the new 
spells, subclasses, stat blocks, or styles, we hope you find many a-wondrous thing to set your imagination aflame. So, go forth! Let your will be done as you use this tome to craft tales both thrilling and chilling. Seek the secrets of magic and press on to uncover ever more mysteries, for there are many wonders to find along the way.

CHAPTER 1 CHARACTER OPTIONS


Magic calls to people of all types and drives many of them
to seek the life of an adventurer. Here, you’ll find guidance 
on making magical characters, the new witch base class, subclasses for existing spellcasting base classes, and backgrounds suitable for all kinds of characters.
New Spells. Some of the class options presented in this 
chapter list spells marked with an asterisk (*), indicating they can be found in this book. See the Spell Descriptions chapter for more details on these spells.


Making Magic Matter
T oo often, the narrative wonders of magic become 
overtaken by game mechanics. Remembering why the arcane is exciting while grappling with spell slot accounting, calculating ranges, and reading through long spell descriptions can be difficult. While these complexities inevitably come with running a spellcaster, there are plenty of ways to focus on the unique elements of magic that sit at the heart of the fantasy genre.


MAKING MAGICAL CHARACTERS
GMs have plenty of ways to weave magic stories into their games (see the Magic in Y our Campaign chapter), but players often face difficulty making their characters feel like part of a magical world. T o enhance your experience as a spellcasting character, start by considering some of the questions below. Defining details about your character’s relationship with their own power often leads to exciting narrative discoveries!


Here are some questions to ask yourself when creating
or portraying a spellcasting character:
• What is your history with magic? Were you born with magical abilities, or did power come to you later in life?
• Can you live without magic? Would you give it up if you could?Character Options

10
DEEP MAGIC VOLUME 2• How do you feel about people who don’t have 
 magical abilities?
• What do you believe is the source of your magic?
• How did you learn to harness your magical power?
• Do you control your magic? Or does it control you?
• How much about your magic do you understand? Are you content with your level of understanding?
• What physical, mental, or emotional sensations do you experience when you use magic? Is it always the same or do certain kinds of interactions feel different?
• How do you feel about your magical abilities? 
• How do you feel about the magical abilities of others?


Witch
Witches seek knowledge, power, and connection in their communion with nature.  They cultivate their bond to these elemental and primal forces, becoming guardians at the gate, attendants of deep knowledge, and liaisons to a realm of immeasurable possibilities.


SPIRITS OF NATURE
Witches have a deep connection to nature, often stemming from years of studying the natural world and regular communion with nature spirits. Theirs can be a practice of utility, veneration, or exploitation. Some commune through a deity of magic or nature, but most prefer to commune directly, with wind on their face, dirt underfoot, and blood on their tongue.
Nature spirits are everywhere and in myriad forms, 
from the fundamental forces of the elements to the primal spirits of living things. A witch communicates with all spirits, whether small and fleeting, emerging spontaneously only to quickly condense back into the ebb and flow of the natural world, or massive ancients, dozing in lost corners while the world moves around them. With patient and skilled determination, witches appeal to these diverse beings—by befriending, cajoling, or coercing them—calling them into focus and coaxing them into service to perform both mundane and otherworldly feats.


CREATING A WITCH
When making a witch, consider why your character has a close bond with nature.  Perhaps your character sensed their connection to nature from a young age, growing up and playing within the nearby woods, or they became lost or orphaned as a child only to be found and raised by 
a kindly witch. Perhaps the spirits of nature won’t leave you alone, constantly asking for help, though no one else can see them, and you take on this role reluctantly to curb constant disturbance. Perhaps you actively shunned the mortal world because of the actions of others, favoring the embrace of the wild.


QUICK BUILD
Y ou can make a witch quickly by following these suggestions. First, Charisma should be your highest ability score, followed by Constitution. Second, choose the cometborn background (see the Backgrounds section later in this chapter). Third, choose the druidcraft, guidance, produce flame and shillelagh cantrips, along with the 1st-level spells charm person and thunderwave.

Hit Points at 1st Level: 8 + your Constitution modifierHit Points at Higher Levels: 1d8 (or 5) + your 
Constitution modifier per witch level after 1stProficiencies

Y ou start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:
• (a) a shortbow and 20 arrows or (b) any simple weapon
• (a) two daggers or (b) any simple melee weapon
• Leather armor, an explorer’s pack, and a druidic focus
12
DEEP MAGIC VOLUME 2COVEN
At 1st level, you dedicate yourself to the traditions of a 
particular coven of your choice, such as the Coven of the 
Hidden Moon, the Coven of the Roiling Hearth, or the 
Coven of the Verdant Wood, each of which is detailed at 
the end of the class description. Y our choice grants you features at 1st level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.


SPELLCASTING
Drawing on your communion with spirits and connection to the natural world, you can cast spells, coaxing the 
power out of the myriad spirits of nature.


Cantrips
Y ou know four cantrips of your choice from the witch spell list (see the Spell Lists chapter for the full list of witch 
spells). Y ou learn additional witch cantrips of your choice 
at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Witch table.


Spell Slots
The Witch table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your witch spells of 1st level and higher. T o cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. Y ou regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.
For example, if you know the 1st-level spell thunderwave, 
and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast thunderwave using either slot.
Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher
At 1st level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the witch spell list. The Spells Known column of the Witch table shows when you learn more witch spells of your choice. A spell you choose must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the table. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.
In addition, when you gain a level in this class, you can 
choose one of the witch spells you know and replace it with another spell from the witch spell list, which also 
must be of a level for which you have spell slots.


Spellcasting Ability
Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your witch 
spells. Y our magic comes from negotiating and working 
with spirits to manifest your intentions. Y ou use your


Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting
ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a witch spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.
Spell save DC = 8 + proficiency bonus + Charisma 
modifier
Spell attack modifier = proficiency bonus + Charisma 
modifierRitual Casting
Y ou can cast any witch spell you know as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag.


Spellcasting Focus
Y ou can use a druidic focus as a spellcasting focus for your witch spells. Some witch implements can also function as a spellcasting focus, as described in the Spirit Binding feature.


SPIRIT BINDING
At 2nd level, practice with your coven unlocks the secrets of binding a spirit’s power into an object called a witch’s implement.  When you gain this feature, choose one witch’s implement from the options below. Y ou know how to make this witch’s implement, and you can do so by performing a 1-hour spirit-binding ritual with the appropriate object at hand. This ritual can be performed during a short or long rest.
If you lose an implement or it is destroyed, you 
can repeat this ritual to bind a new spirit to a suitable replacement vessel. If a previous implement of the same type still exists when you perform this ritual, the binding ends on that previous object. Due to the nature of the binding, implements you create are only usable by you and any bound spirits are released from your implements when you die. 
As you gain levels in the witch class, you learn how to 
create additional types of witch’s implement. Choose an additional type of witch’s implement from the options below at 5th level and again at 15th level. Y ou can have witch’s implements of different types active at the same time—provided you have performed the necessary spirit-binding rituals for each.
Brewer’s Cauldron
Y ou bind a spirit into a nonmagical cauldron, kettle, or other portable cooking container. When you first learn how to create this implement, your Hit Dice becomes 1d10 per witch level instead of 1d8—including for the level gained that unlocked this feature. Y our hit point maximum also increases by 1 for each previous level you have in the witch class when you learn how to create this implement. For example, if you learn how to create this witch’s implement at 5th level, your Hit Dice becomes 1d10 for 5th level and every level in the witch class thereafter, and your hit point maximum increases by 4.
Brewed Concordance. As part of a long rest, you can use 
your cauldron to prepare a brew that fortifies the soul. This brew can be consumed by a number of creatures equal to your proficiency bonus. Each creature that partakes of the brew gains 1d8 temporary hit points which last until the next time the creature finishes a long rest.
13
CHAPTER 1 CHARACTER OPTIONSSpellcasting Focus. Y ou can use your brewer’s cauldron 
as a spellcasting focus. Whenever you cast a spell of 1st 
level or higher that restores hit points to a creature using this item as your spellcasting focus, the creature regains additional hit points equal to your proficiency bonus.


Greater Binding
Once you gain access to greater binding, your brewer’s cauldron gains the following additional features.
Brewed Concordance. Each creature that partakes of 
your brew now gains 1d12 temporary hit points, instead of 1d8. 
Efficient Implement. Y our brewer’s cauldron can take 
the place of one material component worth 500 gp or less in a spell you cast. Using the cauldron in place of a material component does not damage or destroy the cauldron—even if the required component would typically be consumed by casting. Alternatively, the cost of all material components required for spells you cast using the cauldron as your spellcasting focus are reduced by half.


Nightflyer
Y ou bind a spirit into a nonmagical broom, staff, or a similarly sized branch. When you learn how to create this implement, you are infused with the irrepressible energy of the night. Y ou have advantage on all ability checks or saving throws against being grappled or restrained. In addition, once per short or long rest, you can take an additional action on your turn which you must use to Dash, Disengage, or Dodge.
Night’s Journey. 
While nightflyer is within 30 feet of you, 
you can use a bonus action to activate the spirit within the broom, staff, or branch. While the spirit is active, nightflyer 
is a magic object with a flying speed of 30 feet and the ability to hover. Nightflyer can carry up to 1,000 pounds of weight. On your turn, you can mentally command the spirit to move nightflyer up to its movement speed (no action required by you). It can’t take other actions.
As part of your movement, you can mount or dismount 
nightflyer while it is within 5 feet of you. Doing so costs an amount of movement equal to half your speed.
While nightflyer is active, you can use a bonus action 
to deactivate it. Y ou can keep nightflyer activated for up to 1 minute. Deduct the time it was active in increments of 6 seconds (1 round) from nightflyer’s total active time. If nightflyer is flying when you deactivate it or when the duration expires, it—and anything attached to it—descend at a rate of 30 feet per round until it lands.


Nightflyer regains all expended flying capability when
you finish a long rest.


Greater Binding
Once you gain access to greater binding, your nightflyer gains the following additional feature.
Night’s Journey. Nightflyer can now be active for up to 
4 hours. Deduct the time it was active in increments of 1 minute from nightflyer’s total active time. In addition, nightflyer’s flying speed increases to 40 feet.


Soul Candle
Y ou bind a spirit into a candle, which can be mounted on a candlestick, in a lantern, as part of a candelabra, or similar. Only you can light or extinguish the soul candle, which you can do mentally as a bonus action. Though the light appears to be a flame, it doesn’t burn the candle, and it produces no heat. The lit soul candle extinguishes if you are more than 60 feet away from it. While the candle is lit, you can choose for it to shed dim light in a 5-foot radius, or you can choose for it to shed bright light in a 5- to 60-foot radius and dim light for an additional number of feet equal to the chosen radius. The candle can shed light of whatever color you choose, and changing the radius, brightness, or color of light shed by the soul candle requires no action.   
Soul Fire. 
As an action while the soul candle is lit, 
you can force the candle to burn with a supernatural substance called soul fire, causing the candle to emit one of the following effects of your choice instead of bright or dim light. Y ou can change the effect’s radius as if it were light shed by the candle, as detailed above. While soul fire is active, you can use a bonus action to change which effect the soul candle emits. Soul fire can be activated for up to 1 minute, ending early if you extinguish the soul

DEEP MAGIC VOLUME 2candle. Deduct the time it was active in increments of 6 
seconds (1 round) from the soul fire’s total active time. The soul candle regains all expended soul fire time when you finish a long rest.
• Dark Sight. Y ou can see normally in darkness, both magical and nonmagical, in the candle’s radius. 
• Heart Sight. Y ou can see invisible creatures and objects within the candle’s radius as if they were visible. In addition, you are aware of any creatures within the candle’s radius. This effect reveals a creature’s presence but doesn’t allow you to automatically see the creature, such as making you aware of a creature on the other side of a door. 
• Magic Sight. Y ou can sense the presence of magic within the candle’s radius, and you see a faint aura around any visible creature or object in the area that bears magic, learning its school, if any. This effect otherwise works like the detect magic spell.
• Deep Sight. Y ou can see through solid matter within the candle’s radius. T o you, solid objects within that radius appear transparent and don’t prevent light from passing through them. This vision can penetrate 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, or up to 3 feet of wood or dirt. Thicker substances block this effect, as does a thin sheet of lead.
Spellcasting Focus. Y ou can use your soul candle as a spellcasting focus. The first time you cast a spell that requires a spell attack roll using this item as your spellcasting focus on your turn, you have advantage on the spell attack roll.


Greater Binding
Once you gain access to greater binding, your implement gains the following features.
Soul Fire. Soul fire can now be active for up to 10 
minutes. Deduct the time it was active in increments of 1 minute from the soul fire’s total active time.


Spirit Book
Y ou bind a spirit into a book, scroll, or other object suitable for recording information. When you first learn how to create this implement, choose three cantrips from any class’s spell list (the three needn’t be from the same list). While the spirit book is on your person, you can cast those cantrips at will. They don’t count against your number of cantrips known. If they don’t appear on the witch spell list, they are nonetheless witch spells for you.
Book of Knowledge. Whenever you gain a new spell slot 
from gaining a level in this class, one spell of your choice from any class’s spell list appears in your spirit book in a cipher only you can read. While the spirit book is on your person, you can expend spell slots to cast these spells like any other spell you know. Each of these spells counts as a witch spell for you, but it doesn’t count against the number of witch spells you know. When you first learn how to create this implement, 
the book fills with one spell of your choice of each level of witch spell you can cast. For example, if you select this Spirit Binding at 5th level, the book gains one 1st-level spell, one 2nd-level spell, and one 3rd-level spell of your choice from any class’s spell list. Y our spirit book can never contain more than one spell of each level you can cast, to a maximum of 9 spells at 17th level. 
Universal Language. While holding the book, the 
spirit contained within it can translate languages for you, allowing you to read any written language and understand any language you hear.


Greater Binding
Once you gain access to greater binding, your implement gains the following features.
Knowledge Quest. As an action, you can unleash the 
spirit within your book to investigate a problem and return to you with solutions. For 1 minute, the spirit can answer up to three questions you ask of it. The answer to each question is a one-word, truthful answer, such as “yes,” “no,” “maybe,” “never,” “irrelevant,” or “unclear” (if the spirit doesn’t know the answer to the question). The spirit’s knowledge is limited to what is common knowledge in the region where you are asking the question. Therefore, the spirit can confirm the name of the local lord’s lead advisor but not that the advisor is secretly a doppelganger. Once you use the spirit book in this way, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.
Universal Language. While holding the book, you can 
now speak and write in any language, in addition to being able to read any written language and understand any language you hear.


Thundering Aegis
Y ou bind a spirit into a bell, gong, chime, or other percussion instrument. When you first learn how to create this implement, you gain proficiency in one of the following skills of your choice: Investigation, Perception, or Performance. If you have proficiency in all of these skills, choose one. Y ou now double your proficiency bonus whenever you make an ability check using the chosen skill.
Chime of Revealing. While holding the thundering 
aegis, you can use an action to begin ringing it, banging it, or otherwise causing sound to issue from it, creating an audible soundscape that can be heard up to 60 feet away. While you can hear the sound created by your thundering aegis, you perceive your surroundings within 30 feet of you as if you had blindsight—including being able to target creatures or objects within this radius with attacks and spells. 
On each of your subsequent turns, you must use a bonus 
action to continue ringing the bell, banging the gong, or similarly creating sound from the thundering aegis. Otherwise, this effect ends.
15
CHAPTER 1 CHARACTER OPTIONSChime of Deviation. While holding the thundering 
aegis, you can use an action to create a note that holds 
certain types of creatures at bay. For 1 minute, whenever an aberration, celestial, elemental, fey, fiend, or undead starts its turn within 30 feet of you, it must succeed a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC or be unable to move any closer to you that turn. Once you use this feature of the thundering aegis, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.
Spellcasting Focus. Y ou can use your thundering aegis as 
a spellcasting focus. Whenever you cast a spell that deals damage using this item as your spellcasting focus, the spell deals double damage to objects and structures.


Greater Binding
Once you gain access to greater binding, your implement gains the following features.
Chime of Revealing. While you can hear your chime of 
revealing, you now perceive your surroundings within 60 feet of you as if you had blindsight—including being able to target creatures or objects within this radius with spells. 
Spellcasting Focus. Whenever you cast a spell that deals 
damage using this item as your spellcasting focus, the spell deals double damage to constructs, as well as to objects and structures.


HEX
At 3rd level, you can create a potent disruptive magical effect called a Hex. When a creature you can see within 60 feet of you makes an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, you can use a reaction to hex the creature. The hexed creature gains one Hex die, a d4. The creature must roll the Hex die and subtract the number rolled from the ability check, attack roll, or saving throw that triggered your reaction. Once the Hex die is rolled, it is lost. A creature can have only one Hex die at a time.


Y ou can use this feature a number of times equal to your
proficiency bonus. Y ou regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.


Y our Hex die changes when you reach certain levels in
this class. The die becomes a d6 at 5th level, a d8 at 10th level, and a d10 at 15th level.


ABILITY SCORE IMPROVEMENT
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.


GREATER BINDING
When you reach 9th level, you learn to draw greater power from the spirits bound to your witch implements. One of the witch implements you know how to make gains the benefits of the Greater Binding detailed in the implement’s entry in the Spirit Binding feature.When you reach 13th level and again at 17th level, you 
learn to draw greater power from one additional witch implement you know, which gains the benefits of its Greater Binding.


SPIRIT SHROUD
At 20th level, you can use an action to call nearby spirits to form a field around you and lend their energy to your spells. For 1 minute, or until you fall unconscious, you gain the following benefits: 
• Each creature of your choice that starts its turn within 10 feet of you takes force damage equal to twice your proficiency bonus.
• Whenever you cast a witch spell with a casting time of 1 
action, you can cast it using a bonus action instead.
• Hostile creatures within 10 feet of you have 
disadvantage on saving throws against your witch spells.
Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.


COVENS
Witches come together with other likeminded witches for community, knowledge, and protection. Y ou and your coven draw upon one another’s strengths, or maybe you drive each other through rivalry. Whatever the nature of the connection, you all have a shared interest, a shared power, and a shared communion in the natural world.


COVEN OF THE HIDDEN MOON
Witches in the Coven of the Hidden Moon find their strength in the moon, especially when it is waning and new. Dancing along to the crickets, loam under your bare feet, while under the starry night sky? If it were possible, you’d never stop.


Coven Spells
Y ou learn additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the Hidden Moon Spells table.


SOLITARY PRACTITIONERS
The word “coven” often implies a group of witches who 
meet regularly to conduct rites, cast spells, and share 
knowledge. However, in the context of this class, a 
solitary witch without access to other practitioners is still categorized into a coven based on the primary way they 
draw power and the types of spirits with which they have 
natural affinity. For such witches, their “coven” might be 
the spirits whose company they keep.

feature again until you finish a long rest.

While the spirits are present, any creature that 
attacks you must first make a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the attack targets one of the spirits instead of you. A spirit’s AC equals 10 + your proficiency bonus. If an attack hits a spirit, that spirit is destroyed.

At 14th level, you can use an action to free your spirit from its corporeal housing. Y ou transform into a fiery spirit, burning away your body from the inside out.

DEEP MAGIC VOLUME 2Plant Sense
When you choose this coven at 1st level, your deep 
connection to plants gives you an intuitive understanding of them. As an action, you can examine a nonmagical plant you can see within 5 feet of you. When you do so, you immediately learn its basic properties, including whether it is edible, if it is poisonous or otherwise dangerous, and in what type of environment it typically grows. Y ou also learn its condition, including whether it is unwell due to magical or mundane means. 
In addition, you have advantage on Charisma checks to 
interact with Plant creatures.


Drawing the Green
Starting at 1st level, you can use an action to call on the spirits of native flora to aid you for 1 minute. While the spirits are present, you can exert control over nearby terrain and gain the following benefits:
• Encourage Growth. As a bonus action, you can encourage native flora to grow or recede. Choose any number of spaces within 15 feet of you. Each space fills with nonmagical difficult terrain until the start of your next turn. Alternatively, a chosen space that contains nonmagical difficult terrain is no longer difficult terrain until the start of your next turn. These effects end early if you move more than 15 feet away from an affected space.
• Hinder Advance. Whenever a 
creature moves into a space within 15 feet of you, you can use a reaction to direct thorns, roots, and spiked vines to rise up against the creature. The target takes piercing damage equal to your proficiency bonus.
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.


Creeping Overgrowth
At 6th level, you can infuse your hexes with all-consuming growth. When you use your Hex feature against a creature, the target must make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC at the end of its turn. The Hex die doesn’t apply to this saving throw. If the target fails the save, shoots of greenery sprout from its body for 1 minute, reducing its speed by 10 feet. At the start of each of the target’s turns, its movement speed is reduced by an additional 5 feet 
as the greenery continues to grow.  Whenever the target takes necrotic damage or slashing 
damage, it can repeat the saving throw. On a success, the effect ends, and the target’s speed returns to normal. Alternatively, the target or any creature within 5 feet of it can use an action to destroy the greenery. If a creature does so, the effect ends, but the target takes piercing damage equal to 1d8 + your proficiency bonus.


Ascendance of the Green
At 10th level, you gain greater mastery over the spirits of native flora that you call to your side. The benefits you gain while using Drawing the Green increase in power:
• Enhanced Growth. When you use Encourage Growth, you can now choose any number of spaces within 30 feet of you.
• Halted Advance. When you use Hinder Advance, 
the target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC or its speed becomes 0 until the start of its next turn.

CHAPTER 1 CHARACTER OPTIONSOne with the Green
At 14th level, you and the spirits of native flora are 
inseparable, subtly changing your body. Y ou gain tremorsense out to a range of 30 feet, and spending 1 hour in sunlight provides you with enough nourishment to sustain you for one day. In addition, when you start your turn in bright light, you regain hit points equal to your proficiency bonus. This amount doubles if you start your turn in sunlight. Once you have regained an amount of hit points in this way equal to half your hit point maximum, you can’t regain hit points in this way again until you finish a long rest.


Subclasses
This section includes a variety of subclass options for spellcasting characters.


BARD COLLEGES
At 3rd level, a bard gains the Bard College feature. The following options are available to a bard, in addition to those in the standard rules.


COLLEGE OF CUISINE
Not all bards inspire others through their words and song. Bards of the College of Cuisine express themselves
 
through food and drink. These bards hand out mugs of ale, 
homemade cookies, and flasks of fresh-ground coffee to bolster their allies’ spirits. They are adventuring celebrity chefs, spreading inspiration and comfort with their culinary power. They repeat the motto, “food is magic,” and those who taste their creations spread the gospel.


Bonus Proficiencies
When you join the College of Cuisine at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in cook’s utensils and brewer’s supplies. Y ou can use either of these tools as your spellcasting focus.


Magical Treats
At 3rd level, you can infuse magic into food and drink. Y ou can infuse a number of treats equal to twice your proficiency bonus. Infusing a treat takes an action. When you infuse a treat, choose a spell of 1st or 2nd level that has a casting time of 1 action, that targets only one creature, that requires you to touch the target, and that doesn’t target yourself. Y ou infuse the treat with the chosen spell, expending the spell slot as if you had cast the spell.


If the spell you are infusing into a treat requires you
to make a decision about its effects, such as choosing the curse of bestow curse, you make that choice when you infuse the treat with the spell. If the spell you are infusing into a treat can be cast at a higher level for a more potent effect, such as the increased healing of cure wounds, you can expend a higher-level spell slot to infuse the treat with the higher-level version of the spell. If the spell you are infusing into a treat can be cast at a higher level to affect additional targets, the treat affects only one creature, regardless of the level of the spell slot infused in it. If the spell you are infusing into a treat has a material component, you must expend that component. 
A creature, including you, can eat a magical treat as an 
action, becoming affected by the spell infused in the treat as if you had cast the spell on the creature. The effect lasts for the spell’s maximum duration, and you don’t need to maintain concentration on it. If the spell requires a saving throw, the creature makes the saving throw when it eats the treat and repeats the saving throw if the spell requires repeated saving throws, as normal.


If a creature is incapable of eating a treat due to a
condition, such as being incapacitated or unconscious, another creature can use its action to feed the treat to the indisposed creature. A creature can’t be affected by more than one treat at a time.


Infused treats lose their magic when you finish a long
rest. Y ou regain all expended uses of this feature when you finish a long rest. The maximum level of spell you can
 
infuse into treats increases when you reach certain levels in 
this class. At 5th level, you can infuse up to 3rd-level spells into treats. At 10th level, you can infuse up to 5th-level spells. At 15th-level, you can infuse up to 8th-level spells.

duration of the infused spell or 10 minutes, whichever is higher.

target: charmed or frightened.  
Tangy. One disease affecting the target ends.Toasted. The target gains temporary hit points equal 
to a roll of your Bardic Inspiration die + your Charisma modifier for the duration of the infused spell or 10 minutes, whichever is higher.


Culinary Champion
At 14th level, you become a master of the magical culinary arts. Whenever you infuse a treat using Magical T reats, you can infuse a second treat with the same action, expending spell slots for each treat, as normal. 
In addition, when you expend a Bardic Inspiration die 
to give a magical treat a flavor profile, you can give it one additional flavor profile from T asty T reats or from the following options:
Caramelized. The target’s exhaustion is reduced  
by one level.
Earthy. One curse affecting the target ends.Floral. An effect reducing one of the target’s ability 
scores ends.

maximum ends.


COLLEGE OF FESTIVALS
The College of Festivals imbues its bards with a magical presence allowing them to turn the direst circumstances into a celebration. The instructors of this college come from a wide range of backgrounds, ensuring the students 
are prepared to facilitate and empower any form of revelry.
The bards of this college are equal parts entertainer, 
party planner, and adventurer. Their performances are inspiring, allowing their allies to draw on their own joy to overcome danger and resolve conflicts. The light inside a bard of festivals can’t be extinguished by mundane or magical means—their jubilance safeguards them and their allies against blade, spell, and despair.


Bastion of Joy
When you join the College of Festivals at 3rd level, you are filled with a light and certainty that can’t be extinguished. Y ou are immune to the frightened condition.
In addition, if a creature you can see within 60 feet of 
you fails a saving throw against being frightened, you can use your reaction to cause that creature to succeed instead. The target then has advantage on saving throws against being frightened for 1 minute. Once you target a creature with this feature, you can’t target that creature with it again until the creature finishes a long rest.


Infinite Revelry
Starting at 3rd level, you can infuse your performance with a magical effervescence that transforms even the direst circumstance into an occasion. As a bonus action, you can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration to create an aura of revelry that extends 15 feet from you.

• Each creature of your choice within the aura ignores difficult terrain.
• Whenever a friendly creature, including yourself, within the aura regains hit points, the creature regains additional hit points equal to your proficiency bonus.
• Each creature of your choice within the aura has advantage on ability checks.
When you reach 10th level, the  aura extends 30 feet from you.

those around you. When you activate your Infinite Revelry aura, one creature you can see or that can hear you within 60 feet of you gains one Bardic Inspiration die.

• Compliment. The target has advantage on the next attack roll or saving throw it makes within 1 minute.
• Feast. The target gains temporary hit points equal to twice your proficiency bonus until the target finishes a short or long rest.
• Sing. Creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls made against the target until the start of the target’s next turn.


COLLEGE OF FORTUNE
Bards in the college of fortune are called many things: soothsayer, jester, wanderer, and gambler. These bards are found performing in roadhouses one night and royal courts the next, turning their innate prescience into coin and glory. The College of Fortune has no formal training grounds. Rather, it is a calling for those who can see how the dice will fall, when the talon will slash, or which saga will turn the crowd.
Many bards of fortune take to the adventurer’s life 
because they have seen their own future. Whether that future should be chased or avoided varies by bard, but they often shrug it off and say, “Why not sing a few songs along the way?”


Token of Fortune
When you join the College of Fortune at 3rd level, you can use an action to imbue one of the following types of objects with a measure of prescience: a coin, a card (or deck of cards), a die (or set of dice), or any palm-sized or smaller piece from a game, such as a carved chess piece or similar object. Y ou can have only one token imbued with prescience at a time. If you imbue another, the effect on the previous token ends.
While holding the token, you can use an action to 
cast the augury, detect thoughts, or identify spell without expending a spell slot or material components. Once you use a token of fortune to cast a spell, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest, regardless of how many tokens of fortune you create.


The spell options you can cast from your token of fortune
expand as you reach certain levels in this class. At 7th level, the token can be used to cast the clairvoyance spell. At 11th level, the token can be used to cast the legend lore spell
. Prediction
Starting at 3rd level, you are adept at predicting the immediate future—or at least the immediate future seems to always accommodate your predictions. Whenever a creature you can see within 60 feet of you makes an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, you can use your reaction to expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration and predict the outcome. Before the roll is made, state whether it will be a success or failure and roll your Bardic Inspiration die. After the ability check, attack roll, or saving throw is made, add or subtract the result of your Bardic Inspiration die to the roll to bring the final result of the roll closer to your prediction. 
For example, if your Bardic Inspiration roll was 6, an 
attacker rolled a 10, and the attacker needs a total of 14 to succeed, add the 6 from the Bardic Inspiration die to the attacker’s roll if you predicted the attack would succeed. If you predicted the attack would fail, subtract 6 from the attacker’s roll.


Tip the Scales
At 6th level, your prescience grows. When you use Prediction, you can roll two Bardic Inspiration dice and choose which result to apply to the attack roll, ability check, or saving throw that triggered the Prediction. Y ou still expend only one use of Bardic Inspiration when you use Prediction.


Fates Align
At 14th level, your powers of prescience are nearly unmatched. When you cast a spell of the divination school, the casting time is reduced. If the casting time is more than 1 hour, it is only 1 hour for you. If the casting time is more than 1 minute but no more than 1 hour, it is only 1 minute for you. If the casting time is 1 minute, it is only 1 action for you. In addition, whenever you cast a divination spell of 1st level or higher, you regain one expended use of your Bardic Inspiration.


CLERIC DIVINE DOMAINS
At 1st level, a cleric gains the Divine Domain feature. The following domain options are available to a cleric, in addition to those in the standard rules.


DARKNESS DOMAIN
Darkness enshrouds our private affairs and shelters our secrets. The shadows might protect the hunted from the hunter or conceal danger. Emissaries of the gods who claim dominion over the darkness protect those in need or aid those who hunt in the night—assuming they are not themselves the hunters.
22
DEEP MAGIC VOLUME 2DOOM DOMAIN


Gods with the Doom domain in their portfolios promote
fear, judgment, punishment, and the end of all things.


Priesthoods of such gods consider themselves the
messengers of that doom, and they work to spread word 
of the coming end. Their gloomy, often frightening message makes them unwelcome in many, but not all, civilized places.

A creature that has total cover from you is not affected.


Weight of Guilt

As an action, choose one creature that you can see within 60 feet of you. That creature must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, you automatically know for the next 10 minutes whether anything the target says is true, a lie, or in between. When the effect ends, or if the target succeeds on the saving throw, the target can’t be affected by this feature again until you finish a long rest.


Divine Strike
At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with necrotic energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 necrotic damage to the target.

If a creature already has darkvision, it can see in magical darkness out to a range of 30 feet as if the magical darkness were dim light instead.


Shadow Meld
Beginning at 6th level, you can use an action to merge your current location with the version of it that exists in the Plane of Shadow. For 1 minute, or until you dismiss it as a bonus action, the area within 60 feet of you becomes connected to shadow. Bright light becomes dim light, dim light becomes darkness, and darkness becomes magical darkness. In addition, the temperature plummets in the area, and when a creature other than you ends its turn in the area, it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 1d8 cold damage. If this effect lasts the full duration, there is a 5 percent chance 2d4 shadows appear in unoccupied spaces in the area. At the GM’s discretion, the shadows might be indifferent or hostile toward you and your companions. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.


Divine Strike
At 8th level, you can infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature 
with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 necrotic damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8
.


Shadow Shield
At 17th level, your shadow can defend you. Each time you take nonmagical damage, your shadow prevents half of it. When your shadow has prevented damage equal to a quarter of your hit point maximum, it can’t prevent damage again until you finish a long rest.

LABYRINTH DOMAIN
The savage and cunning god of the minotaurs has few followers, but those who heed the call gain the ability to smash and confound their foes. The Labyrinth domain grants powers associated with the mazes that minotaurs love and with misleading enemies. The maze is your holy temple, and its winding corridors and deadly traps are the hallmarks of your faith.


LABYRINTH DOMAIN SPELLS

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until 
you finish a long rest.


PESTILENT DOMAIN
Pestilence embodies the diseases and vermin that plague civilization—viewed as “bad air,” divine punishments, curses, or even demons lurking within the body to corrupt it from within. Deities with this domain may be both healers and killers, striking the unworthy with afflictions while blessing their flock with health. Deities of any alignment may claim this domain, though the good-aligned ones focus more on ameliorating disease while evil ones prefer to wield pestilence as a weapon. Examples of plague deities in real-world mythology include the Greco-Roman Apollo, the Aztec Chalchiuhtotolin, and the Mesopotamian deities Nergal and Pazuzu.

Poxcaster
At 17th level, you gain immunity to poison and disease. In addition, you can cast the contagion spell once without expending a spell slot. When you do so, you can cast the spell at any creature you can see within 60 feet of you, requiring a ranged spell attack instead. Once you cast contagion in this way, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.


SAINTS DOMAIN
Unlike other domains, the Saint’s Domain doesn’t focus on association with any particular types of gods. Clerics who adopt this domain—or are unknowingly called to it—dedicate themselves to the protection of others and draw strength from the transcendent love that binds communities together. Such selfless dedication awakens a spark of divinity within an individual, granting them miraculous powers to defend others.

Shared Suffering
Also at 1st level, you can divert injuries dealt to your allies by taking on some of their pain. When a friendly creature you can see within 30 feet of you takes damage, you can use your reaction to prevent any amount of that damage. If you do so, you lose hit points equal to the damage prevented, regardless of the type of damage and your resistances or immunities.


Y ou can use this feature a number of times equal to your
proficiency bonus. Y ou regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.a sickly, green aura and have disadvantage on Charisma 
checks other than Charisma (Intimidation) checks for 10 
minutes or until you lose your concentration (as if you were concentrating on a spell). In addition, one of these 
creatures of your choice also manifests a green sigil of 
sickness in an obvious location, such as the forehead, for 
the duration. Y ou have advantage on attack rolls, Wisdom (Medicine) checks, and saving throws against the creature marked with the green sigil.


Manifest Pestilent Spirit
At 6th level, you can force the malevolent energy of a disease or poison to manifest into a fiendish physical form that spreads plague or cures those nearby who are afflicted by it. Y ou intone a prayer of pestilence at a creature you can see within 60 feet of you that is poisoned or suffering a disease. The poisoned condition or disease ends in the target, and a vaguely humanoid embodiment of the disease or poison manifests in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the target. The pestilence creature’s form exhibits characteristics of its affliction. A plague might produce a pestilence creature covered in boils, while a poison might produce a creature with green, oozing flesh.
The pestilence creature is hostile to every creature, 
including you. The pestilence creature’s statistics change based on the saving throw DC of the disease or poison that it represents. If the saving throw DC is 10 or less, the creature uses the statistics of a zombie. If the saving throw DC is 10 to 15, it uses the statistics of a mummy without Dreadful Glare. If the saving throw DC is over 15, it uses the statistics of a water elemental. In all cases, the pestilence creature’s Slam or Rotting Fist attack causes the poisoned condition or spreads the disease on a failed Constitution saving throw, using the original disease or poison’s saving throw DC. In the case of a pestilence creature using the statistics of a mummy, this disease or poison replaces the mummy rot normally spread through the mummy’s Rotting Fist.


If you expend a use of your Channel Divinity when you
create the pestilence creature, you can control the creature for up to 1 minute or until you lose your concentration (as if you were concentrating on a spell). The pestilence creature remains until destroyed. If the pestilence creature is destroyed, each creature within 100 feet of it that is poisoned or suffering the disease it represents is no longer poisoned and is cured of that particular disease.


Once you use this feature to manifest a creature with a
disease or poison saving throw DC equal to or lower than your spell save DC, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest. Once you use this feature to manifest a creature with a disease or poison saving throw DC higher than your spell save DC, you can’t do so again until 3 days have passed.

CIRCLE OF SCAVENGERS
Druids from the Circle of Scavengers are drawn to wherever rot, rubble, and death have taken hold. Their magic is deeply rooted in regeneration and the powerful recycling of the natural world. These druids align themselves with carrion birds to enhance their perception and see the value in what has been cast off. They see themselves as cleansers who transform refuse and waste into vital elements to be used again. 
While occasionally mistaken for necromancers, the 
Circle of Scavengers does not seek dominion over death. Instead, their magic hurries along decomposition and rot so that new life can take hold.


Circle Spells

Halo of Feathers
Starting at 2nd level, as a bonus action, you can expend one 
use of your Wild Shape feature to surround yourself in a 
magical aura of black feathers, rather than assuming a beast 
form. While the aura is active, your body becomes covered 
in feathers, you appear to be surrounded by dozens of 
shadowy black birds, and you gain the following benefits : 
• Deathly Countenance. Each hostile creature that starts its turn within 15 feet of you must succeed on a 
Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or be frightened of you until the end of its next turn. Undead 
have disadvantage on this saving throw. If a creature’s 
saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the 
creature is immune to Deathly Countenance for the 
next 24 hours.
• Decompose. Whenever you deal damage to a creature within 15 feet of you, you can deal an extra 1d4 necrotic 
damage to the target. Y ou can deal this extra damage to

decomposes, and it can be restored to life only by means

Circle Spells
Y our bond with the spirits of nature grants you knowledge of certain spells. Y our link to these spirits grants you access to additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the Circle of Spirits Spells table. 
Once you gain access to a circle spell, you always have 
it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn’t appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.

Y ou innately know this spell and don’t need to prepare it to cast it. Y ou can cast find familiar only as a ritual, and it requires no material components. The familiar you call with this spell is your spirit guide.
As long as you and your spirit guide are within 100 feet 
of each other, the spirit guide can maintain concentration on a druid spell you cast. Y ou must choose whether you or your spirit guide is concentrating on a spell when you cast it, and this decision can’t be changed on a subsequent turn. Y ou can still have only one concentration spell in effect at a time; if you concentrate on a different spell or effect, the spirit guide’s concentration ends. Y ou can still 
share your spirit guide’s senses and cast spells through it as normal, even if it is maintaining concentration on a spell. If the spirit guide is concentrating on a spell, it makes Constitution saving throws to maintain concentration when it takes damage, not when you take damage.


Spirit Dance
Starting at 6th level, you can use a bonus action to perform a quick dance to channel the power of the spirit world. The next druid spell you cast within 1 minute is enhanced by the dance.

PALADIN SACRED OATHS
At 3rd level, a paladin gains the Sacred Oath feature. The following options are available to a paladin, in addition to those in the standard rules.


OATH OF ANNIHILATION
The Oath of Annihilation is as ancient as the darkness between stars. Paladins who take this oath—sometimes called antipaladins, dark paladins, or death knights—represent the antithesis of the ideal protector knight. They see themselves as divine instruments of reckoning and foretellers of armageddon. Despite their extreme viewpoint and often brutal behavior, they still conduct themselves honorably and expect to be treated with respect. Many who swear this oath are devoted to gods of destruction, chaos, and war.


Tenets of Annihilation
The principles of this oath are simple and emphasize the value of strength above all else.
Extinguish the Weak. An opponent who lacks the 
strength to prevail in combat must be ushered into the embrace of death.
Maintain the Balance. For life to flourish, there must be 
destruction. The strong endure; the weak succumb.
28
DEEP MAGIC VOLUME 2Harbinger of the End
At 20th level, you can use an action to assume the form 
of a harbinger of the apocalypse. Y our appearance alters in some frightening way of your choosing. For example, your skin could take on the texture of broken stone and magma, your hair could become flames, or you could sprout demonic horns and a tail. For 1 minute, you gain the following benefits:
• When you reduce a creature to 0 hit points, you regain 20 hit points.
• Creatures don’t have resistance to the damage you deal, even if they normally have such resistance. A creature can still be immune to the damage you deal. 
• Each creature of CR 10 or lower that starts its turn within 15 feet of you is frightened of you.
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.


OATH OF THE SPELLSWORN
Paladins who dedicate themselves to the Oath of the Spellsworn train to defend spellcasting allies in the heat of battle. They attune to arcane energies to increase the capabilities of those they are sworn to protect and efficiently eliminate enemy magicians who interfere with their charge’s capabilities.


Tenets of the Spellsworn
This oath binds a paladin to the role of guardian—not just to physically defend the spellcasters they fight beside, but also to ward against the psychic temptations that magical power brings. 
Hold the Line. Safeguard your fellows so they might live 
to fight another day. Be the first and last barrier to your foes. 
Constant Vigilance. Power is a corrupting force that can 
poison any who wield it. Guard those with such abilities, especially from themselves. 
Maintain the Balance. Punish those who use magic for 
evil purposes. Wrest back natural order from those who would subvert it.

Channel Divinity
When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options. See the Sacred Oath class feature for how Channel Divinity works.
Vow of Ruin. As a bonus action, you can utter a vow of 
ruination, using your Channel Divinity. For 1 minute, each time you hit an object or Construct, the attack is a critical hit. If your weapon is nonmagical, it becomes a magic weapon with a +1 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls for the duration.
Wither Foe. As an action, you can present your holy 
symbol and speak a prayer of damnation, using your Channel Divinity. Choose one creature within 60 feet of you that you can see. That creature must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, it takes necrotic damage equal to your Charisma modifier + your paladin level, and it has disadvantage on saving throws for 1 minute or until it is reduced to 0 hit points.


Aura of Inevitability
Starting at 7th level, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you can’t be frightened while you are conscious. When you or a friendly creature within 10 feet of you takes damage, the damage is reduced by an amount equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1).

Annihilating Smite
Starting at 15th level, your smites are powerful enough to bring your foes to their knees. When you use your Divine Smite against a creature that is Large or smaller, the creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw against 
your spell save DC or be knocked prone.

CHAPTER 1 CHARACTER OPTIONS


Channel Divinity
When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the 
following two Channel Divinity options. 
Arcane Tether. As a bonus action, you 
create a magical bond between yourself and one creature you can see within 30 feet of you, using your Channel Divinity. For 1 minute, whenever the target attempts—or would be forced—to move or teleport more than 30 feet away from you, you can force the target to make a Charisma saving throw (no action required by you). On a success, the creature moves as intended. On a failure, the target can’t leave its current space through mundane or magical means until the end of your next turn. The target can choose to fail this saving throw. 
Spell Breaker. When you hit a 
target with a weapon attack as part of the Attack action, you can expend one use of Channel Divinity to end one spell affecting the target. If the target is under the effects of multiple spells, the lowest level spell ends. In the event of a tie, you decide which spell ends.


Aura of Focus
Starting at 7th level, each friendly creature within 10 feet of you automatically succeeds on Constitution saving throws that it makes to maintain concentration on a spell when it takes damage, and each hostile creature within 10 feet of you has disadvantage on Constitution saving throws that it makes to maintain concentration on a spell when it takes damage. This aura is active only while you are conscious. 
At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.


Spell Shredder
At 15th level, you can bolster your allies against the arcane. Whenever you or a friendly creature you can see within 30 feet of you fails a saving throw against a spell or other magical effect, you can use your reaction to cause them to succeed instead. If the source of the triggering effect is a creature, it takes 1d12 force damage. Y ou can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. Y ou regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.Arcane Bulwark
At 20th level, you can assume the form of an arcane bulwark, cloaking yourself in a shield of raw magic power. As an action, you undergo a transformation. For 1 minute, you gain the following benefits:
• Y ou have advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
• Y ou have resistance to all types of magical damage.
• When you succeed on a saving throw against a spell, or when a spell attack misses you, you can choose another creature, including the spellcaster, you can see within 60 feet of you. The spell targets the chosen creature instead of you. If the spell forced a saving throw, the chosen creature makes its own saving throw. If the spell was an attack, the attacker makes a new attack roll against the chosen creature.
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

DEEP MAGIC VOLUME 2
subsequent turns while the doom is active (no action 
required), you can pronounce fiery doom on one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The first time you deal damage to that creature before the start of your next turn, the creature takes extra fire damage equal to your proficiency bonus. Once you activate this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.
Wails and Boils. Y ou can use a bonus action to summon 
a pox-ridden doom that lasts 1 minute. For the duration, you are surrounded by faint whispers and cries of pain and grief, audible to creatures within 10 feet of you. When you first activate the doom and at the start of each of your subsequent turns while the doom is active (no action required), you can pronounce pox-ridden doom on one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. That creature subtracts an amount equal to your proficiency bonus from the next attack roll it makes against one creature of your choice within 60 feet of you (which can include yourself) before the start of your next turn. Once you activate this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.SORCEROUS ORIGINS

DOOMRIDDEN
Through dream, vision, hallucination, or study of esoterica, you have seen the end of all things. The doom at the end of world has revealed itself to you, and it now powers your innate magical abilities. For some doomridden sorcerers, the end comes as a firestorm, 
for others, a storm of thunder and 
pestilence consumes everything. Some of 
these sorcerers have seen the end of things at the hands of a deity or powerful being.


Doomridden sorcerers must find their way in
a world they are convinced will end. For many, this draws them to a life of adventuring, where they may quest to stop—or spur on—the arrival of the apocalypse.


Doomridden Magic
Starting at 1st level, you learn additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the Doomridden Spells table. Each of these spells counts as a sorcerer spell for you, but it doesn’t count against the number of sorcerer spells you know.
Whenever you gain a sorcerer level, you can replace 
one spell you gained from this feature with another spell of the same level. The new spell must be a divination or necromancy spell from the sorcerer, warlock, or wizard spell list.

hands emit soft, red light. When you first activate the doom and at the start of each of your subsequent turns while the doom is active (no action required), you can pronounce a judging doom on one creature you can see within 60 feet of you until the start of your next turn. If that creature fails a saving throw against a spell you cast this turn, it is also frightened of you until the start of your next turn. Once you activate this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.


Disastrous
At 6th level, your connection to the end of all things grows, enhancing your chosen facet of the apocalypse.
Fire and Smoke. When you target a creature with your 
pronouncement of fiery doom, it must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC or be engulfed in smoke and be blinded until the start of your next turn. 
Wails and Boils. When you target a creature with your 
pronouncement of pox-ridden doom, it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or be riddled with pus-filled boils and be poisoned until the start of your next turn. 
Judgment. When you target a creature with your 
pronouncement of judging doom, it must succeed on a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC or have its speed reduced to 0 until the start of your next turn as divine judgment stops it in its tracks.


Cataclysmic
Starting at 14th level, whenever you pronounce doom on a creature, you can expend a number of sorcery points up to your proficiency bonus. If you do, your pronouncement of doom can affect a number of additional creatures equal to that amount. In addition, if you have already activated your doom, you can spend 5 sorcery points to activate it again.


Apocalyptic
At 18th level, while your chosen doom is active, you can channel your apocalyptic essence into a nightmarish manifestation. Once you use this action, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest, unless you spend 7 sorcery points to use it again.
Fire and Smoke. While this doom is active, you can use 
an action to emit a blast of apocalyptic fire. Each hostile creature within 15 feet of you must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failure, a creature takes 6d8 fire damage immediately, and it takes 3d8 fire damage at the start of its next turn. On a success, a creature takes half the fire damage immediately and no additional fire damage at the start of its next turn. 
Wails and Boils. While this doom is active, you can use 
an action to send the wails and cries surrounding you outward in a sickening cacophony. Each creature within 15 feet of you must make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failure, a creature takes 6d8 poison damage and is poisoned and deafened for 1 minute. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn’t poisoned or deafened. A poisoned and deafened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. 
Judgment. While this doom is active, you can use an 
action to call down divine judgment on nearby creatures. Choose a number of creatures you can see within 30 feet of you equal to your proficiency bonus. Each target must make a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failure, a creature takes 5d8 radiant damage and is stunned until the end of its next turn. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn’t stunned.


SHADOW BLOODLINE
In the distant past, your ancestors were touched by shadow magic, and it has left its mark on your family bloodline. Y our magic comes from a place drained of color, where light fights a losing battle against the relentless encroachment of darkness.


It always acts a bit differently from the magic of other
spellcasters. Y our magical fire burns with a deep purple flame that sheds little light but casts inky shadows. The influence of shadow magic can be seen in every manifestation of your work, whether it takes the form of shadowy bonds tightening around the target of a hold 
person spell or the shadows that swirl like storm clouds inside your dimension door.


Shadow Magic
Starting at 1st level, you learn additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the Shadow Spells table. Each of these spells counts as a sorcerer spell for you, but it doesn’t count against the number of sorcerer spells you know.
Whenever you gain a sorcerer level, you can replace one 
spell you gained from this feature with another spell of the same level. The new spell must be a conjuration or illusion spell from the sorcerer, warlock, or wizard spell list.


SHADOW SPELLS

1st black ribbons*, cloak of shadow*
3rd darkbolt*, darkness

32
DEEP MAGIC VOLUME 2WARLOCK OTHERWORLDLY PATRONS
At 1st level, a warlock gains the Otherworldly Patron 
feature. The following options are available to a warlock, in addition to those in the standard rules.


SWARM PATRON
Y ou have made a pact with a powerful and sentient being who appears as a swarm of tiny creatures. Y our patron has gifted you some of the defenses of swarms in exchange for your service. Y ou are set upon the world to grow and spread the influence of this roiling sentient mass. It speaks to you through the clicks of chitinous legs, the squeaks of hidden vermin, and susurration of 
wings flapping unseen in the treetops. An extension 
of your patron’s will, you are made of multitudes and 
pass through the barriers of adventuring on countless skittering legs.


Expanded Spell List
Y our connection to swarms and your patron lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.


SWARM EXPANDED SPELLS
Spell Level Spells
1st feather fall, jump
2nd conjure vermin*, poisonous flesh*
3rd cloak of vermin*, plague walk*
4th aura of filth*, giant insect
5th contagion, insect plague
*Described in Chapter 5


Gather the Swarm
At 1st level, your patron grants you some of the defenses of a swarm. Y ou can use a bonus action to transform into a swarm-like version of yourself. Y ou still wear and can use your equipment, but your body appears to be a mass of writhing insects, vermin, or similar Tiny creatures of the kind that comprise your patron. This effect lasts for 1 minute, until you dismiss it as a bonus action, or until you are incapacitated. If this effect ends while you occupy the space of another creature, you are pushed harmlessly to 
an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the creature. While in 
your swarm form, you gain the following benefits:
• Creeping Swarm. Y ou can occupy another creature’s space and vice versa.
• Flowing Swarm. Y ou can move through any 
opening large enough for a Tiny creature of the kind comprising your patron. Any equipment you are wearing or carrying that is too large for the opening 
doesn’t move through the opening with you.In addition, you can use a bonus action to gaze at one 
creature you can see within 60 feet of you, marking it with 
darkness. The target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC or have disadvantage on the next ability check or attack roll it makes that requires sight. Y ou can gaze at a creature in this way a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. Y ou regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.


Dark Illusions
Starting at 6th level, you have advantage on saving throws against spells of the illusion school and magic that creates illusions, and you have advantage on Intelligence (Investigation) checks to discern illusions for what they are. In addition, you can expend 2 sorcery points to cast 
the blur or mirror image spell without expending a spell slot.


Passage Through the Dark
At 14th level, you can traverse between patches of darkness. While in an area of dim light or darkness, you can expend 4 sorcery points and use 5 feet of movement to magically step inside the shadows surrounding you, temporarily disappearing, and instantly know the location of all other areas of dim light and darkness within 200 feet of you that are large enough to cover you. 
As part of the move used to enter the shadows, you can 
either pass into one of those areas of dim light or darkness you sense or step out of the shadows you’re in. Y ou appear in an unoccupied space of your choice in the destination area of dim light or darkness, using another 5 feet of movement. If you don’t have 5 feet of movement to appear at the destination, you appear in the space you occupied before you magically stepped into the shadows instead. Y ou can’t end your turn magically inside of the shadows.


Tainted Shadows
Beginning at 18th level, you can use an action to radiate an aura of shadow for 1 minute. Bright light within 15 feet of you becomes dim light, and dim light within 15 feet of you becomes darkness. In addition, a hostile creature that starts its turn within 15 feet of you while the aura is active takes necrotic damage equal to your proficiency bonus and must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or become frightened of you until the start of its next turn. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest, unless you spend 6 sorcery points.
33
CHAPTER 1 CHARACTER OPTIONS
• Hungry Swarm. If you are occupying another 
creature’s space at the start of your turn, you can use a bonus action to force it to make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failure, the creature takes 1d4 piercing damage or poison damage (your choice). This damage increases by 1d4 when you reach 5th (2d4), 11th (3d4), and 17th level (4d4). 
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.


Indomitable Swarm
Starting at 6th level, you have advantage on ability checks and saving throws made against being grappled, restrained, and stunned, and while in your swarm form, you have immunity to these conditions. In addition, creatures in your space while you are in your swarm form have disadvantage on Constitution saving throws made to maintain concentration on a spell.


Feed the Swarm
Starting at 10th level, when you deal piercing or poison damage to a creature with the Hungry Swarm aspect of your swarm form, you regain hit points equal to the damage dealt. This feature can restore you to no more than half your hit point maximum.


Overwhelm
At 14th level, when you take on your swarm form, you can choose to become a condensed swarm of hundreds more Tiny creatures, or you can choose to become a Large swarm, occupying the space a Large creature would occupy. While in a condensed swarm form, you have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. While in a Large swarm form, you can choose to target any number of creatures in your space with your Hungry Swarm, and each target must make the saving throw, taking damage on a failure, as normal.


OCEAN LORD PATRON
Y ou have made a pact with a powerful ocean-dwelling entity whose magic bolsters and transforms you. Though most powerful in water, your patron has provided you with the ability to bring the ocean to any environment. Y ou commune with your patron wherever saltwater pools and listen to its wishes in the gurgling bubbles of the deep. Serve your patron well, and it will grant you the power to become an unstoppable aquatic force.


Expanded Spell List
The Ocean Lord lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you. OCEAN LORD EXPANDED SPELLS


Spell Level Spells
1st create or destroy water, thunderwave

5th conjure elemental, enshroud*
*Described in Chapter 5


Oceanic Blessing
At 1st level, your patron enhances your physical body with 
elements of the ocean. Y ou gain a swimming speed of 30 feet, and you can breathe underwater. When you finish a long rest, choose which of the following oceanic blessings 
to accept from your patron. Y ou can have only one blessing at a time. The blessing lasts until you finish a long rest.
Barnacles. Barnacles cover your skin in a protective 
layer. While you are not wearing any armor, your Armor 
Class equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Charisma 
modifier. Y ou can use a shield and still gain this benefit .
Fins. Fins grow along your legs, arms, and spine, 
and webbing grows between your fingers and toes. Y our swimming speed increases by 30 feet, and you have advantage on Strength (Athletics) and Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks while swimming.
34
DEEP MAGIC VOLUME 2Fins. While you have this blessing and are in a body 
of water, you can take the Dash action as a bonus action 
on your turn. As an action, you can share some of your patron’s power with your allies. Each friendly creature of your choice within 30 feet of you gains a swimming speed of 30 feet and can breathe underwater for 8 hours. Once you have shared your patron’s power in this way, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.
Tentacular Limb. While you have this blessing, your 
tentacular limb now deals an extra 1d6 cold damage on a hit. As an action, you can force your tentacular limb to enlarge for 1 hour. While the tentacular limb is enlarged in this way, you can use it to attack any creature you can see within 15 feet of you. In addition to the damage the limb deals on a hit, it now also automatically grapples any Large or smaller creature hit by it. The escape DC for this grapple is equal to your spell save DC. Y our tentacular limb can have only one creature grappled at a time, and you can’t make attacks with the limb while it is grappling a creature. Once you have enlarged your tentacular limb in this way, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.
Poisonous Spines. While you have this blessing, you have 
resistance to poison damage and can’t be poisoned. As a bonus action, you can amplify the poison in your spines for 1 hour. While your poison is amplified, creatures that normally have resistance to poison damage or immunity to the poisoned condition don’t have that resistance or immunity to the poison of your spines. Y ou have advantage on attack rolls against creatures poisoned by your spines, and creatures poisoned by your spines have disadvantage on saving throws against your spells. Once you have amplified your poison in this way, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.


Avatar of the Depths
At 14th level, you can use an action to transform into an avatar of your patron, dripping with saltwater and covered in sea plants and tiny ocean-dwelling animals as if you just stepped out of the ocean depths. Y ou can transform as a bonus action, and the transformation lasts for 1 minute, until you dismiss it as a bonus action, or until you are incapacitated. While transformed, you gain two oceanic blessings of your choice, including their enhanced versions. When this effect ends, you choose which blessing remains active, and only that blessing’s activated enhanced effect remains active, if you activated it while transformed. Y ou also gain the following additional benefits while transformed: 
• Y ou gain temporary hit points equal to twice your warlock level.
• Y our attacks deal double damage to objects and structures.
• Y our swimming speed and walking speed are doubled.
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.Tentacular Limb. A tentacular limb sprouts from a 
location of your choice on your torso. As a bonus action, 
you can make the tentacular limb lash out a creature within 
5 feet of you. Make a melee spell attack. On a hit, the limb deals 1d6 bludgeoning damage to the target. The limb can
 
hold objects weighing up to 10 pounds, but you can’t wield 
weapons or shields with it. Y ou have a measure of control over the limb’s finer movements, allowing you to perform minor tasks that require manual precision, such as using a tool or performing the somatic components of a spell
. 
Poisonous Spines. Poisonous spines jut out from your 
skin. When a creature hits you with a melee attack while within 5 feet of you, it must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC or take 2 (1d4) poison damage and be poisoned until the end of its next turn.


Waverider
Starting at 6th level, you can summon a magical wave of water to carry you safely across land and water. Y ou can use a bonus action to create a wave of water beneath you that transports you to an unoccupied space you can see within 30 feet of you. This movement doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks. The wave can carry you along any horizontal surface with an angle of no higher than 45 degrees, including liquid surfaces, and the wave ignores difficult terrain and protects you from damaging terrain. The wave disappears afterwards, depositing you on the surface at the destination, regardless if the surface is solid, liquid, dangerous, or difficult terrain. 
Alternatively, if you spend 10 minutes conjuring this 
magical wave, you can make it large enough to hold yourself and a number of willing creatures of your choice equal to your proficiency bonus. Each chosen creature must be within 10 feet of you at the end of the 10 minutes to be transported by this wave. A wave conjured in this way has a speed of 240 feet and lasts for 1 hour, until you dismiss it as a bonus action, or until you are incapacitated. This wave otherwise works the same as your personal wave, transporting you and your allies safely across any surface and ignoring the effects of difficult and damaging terrain.
Y ou can conjure a magical wave (of either type) a 
number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. Y ou regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.


Enhanced Blessing
At 10th level, your connection to your patron strengthens, enhancing your oceanic blessing. When you finish a long rest and choose an oceanic blessing, you gain the chosen blessing’s normal effects and that blessing’s enhanced effects, which are detailed as follows:
Barnacles. While you have this blessing, you have 
resistance to cold damage. As a bonus action, you can reinforce your barnacles for 1 hour. While your barnacles are reinforced, you have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. Once you reinforce your barnacles, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.
35
CHAPTER 1 CHARACTER OPTIONSWIZARD ARCANE TRADITIONS
At 2nd level, a wizard gains the Arcane T radition feature. 
The following options are available to a wizard, in addition to the options in the standard rules.


DOOMSAYER
Any fool can learn to hurl a fireball, but only a master of the apocalypse can open a black hole. Wizards who specialize in such apocalyptic magic call themselves doomsayers. Some doomsayers use their terrible power to amass a conquering army; others seek to become a force of darkness and to reshape the world according to their own vision.


Doom Savant
Beginning when you select this specialty at 2nd level, the gold and time you must spend to copy a spell that is part of the doom style of magic (see Chapter 2) into your spellbook is halved.


Wicked Presence
At 2nd level, you gain the ability to instill a sense of impending doom in creatures who witness your power. When a spell you cast of 1st level or higher reduces a creature to 0 hit points, you can use a bonus action to terrify those nearby. Choose a number of creatures within 30 feet of that creature equal to your proficiency bonus. Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or become frightened of you for 1 minute. A frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until 
you finish a short or long rest.


Terrible Power
Starting at 6th level, your critical hits with spells have reverberating effects on their victims. Whenever you score a critical hit with a spell attack, choose one of the following effects for each target of the spell attack:
• The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or become frightened of you until the end of its next turn.
• The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or become poisoned until the end of its next turn.


Merciless Onslaught
Starting at 10th level, you have advantage on spell attack rolls against creatures that are frightened or poisoned.


Power from Darkness
At 14th level, your spell attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20.FEY MAGE
Wizards who study fey magic call themselves fey mages and specialize in enchantment and illusion spells. They 
are commonly recruited by fey courts to spy on rivals or 
cajole information out of a reticent source. These wizards 
excel at creating friends and allies (by magical or mundane means), allowing them into places and circumstances others could not enter.


Wild Nights
When you choose this tradition at 2nd level, you no longer require sleep. Y ou need only 4 hours of light activity to 
gain the benefits of a long rest, and each friendly creature 
that finishes a long rest within 30 feet of you, including 
yourself, reduces its exhaustion level by an additional 
amount equal to half your proficiency bonus at the end of 
a long rest. A creature can gain this benefit only if it spent 
at least half its long rest within 30 feet of you.


Student of Fey Magics
Starting at 2nd level, you can enhance one enchantment 
or illusion spell of 1st level or higher that you cast. The spell is cast as if you expended a spell slot one level higher 

36
DEEP MAGIC VOLUME 2Vril Vitality 
When you choose this tradition at 2nd level, you learn 
how to channel unspent magical energy into vitality. When you finish a long rest, you regain additional spent Hit Dice equal to half the number of unspent spell slots you had before finishing the long rest, up to your total Hit Dice (minimum of one Hit Die). For example, if you are a 6th-level wizard and cast three 1st-level spells, two 2nd-level spells, and two 3rd-level spells before the end of your long rest, you have three unspent spell slots (one 1st-level, one 2nd-level, and one 3rd-level), which means you regain four expended Hit Dice at the end of the long rest: three from your normal Hit Dice recovery for being 6th level and one from Vril Vitality.


Vril Transfer
At 2nd level, your mastery over the basic principles of vril allows you to transfer arcane energy in various ways.
Channel Health. Y our mastery over the vril that flows 
through your veins allows you to convert your own life force into raw arcane power. As a bonus action, you can expend Hit Dice to recover an expended spell slot. When you do so, expend a number of Hit Dice equal to the level of the spell slot you are attempting to recover. Roll the expended Hit Dice and add your Constitution modifier to the roll. Y ou immediately lose hit points equal to the total than the spell slot you expended. Y ou can enhance a spell in this way a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. Y ou regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.


Feybound Sleep
At 6th level, when you cast a spell of 1st level or higher, you can use your reaction to cause one creature that failed its saving throw against the spell to fall into a deep slumber. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or fall unconscious until the end of its next turn. Damage doesn’t awaken the unconscious target. Y ou can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. Y ou regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.


Guile of the Fey
At 10th level, illusion spells you cast require only somatic components. In addition, creatures have disadvantage on Intelligence (Investigation) checks to discern your illusion spells for what they are.


Master of Fey Magics
At 14th level, when you use your Student of Fey Magics feature, you can expend two uses of it to increase the spell’s level by an additional level (to a maximum of 9th), or you can double the duration of the spell.


VRIL CASTER
Few wizards have heard of the ancient practice of vril casting, and even fewer have sought to master the strange and dangerous techniques necessary to use it. Those who dedicate themselves to the study of vril casting are driven to understand and manipulate the fundamental nature of magic, often putting their own lives at risk in the process.
 
WHAT IS VRIL?
Vril is the mysterious, primal force that makes up the 
underlying elements of arcane energy. First harnessed 
by antediluvian cultures and focused through vril staves 
and hollow rods, this raw magical power once allowed mighty arcanists to empower their spells beyond mortal 
limitations. Though rarely studied, vril flows through the 
veins of all those capable of wielding arcane power—
whether they realize it or not.

37
CHAPTER 1 CHARACTER OPTIONSand your hit point maximum is reduced by that amount 
until you finish a long rest. If you have at least 1 hit point remaining after losing these hit points, you successfully recover the spell slot.
Restore Charges. Y our mastery over the flow of vril now 
allows you control over the energy of magic items. As an action, you can expend a spell slot to restore charges to a magic item you are touching. When you do so, the magic item regains expended charges equal to the level of the spell slot expended, up to the item’s maximum number of charges. This feature can’t restore charges to items that don’t have charges, such as a ring of feather falling, and it can’t restore charges to items that are consumed or cease to be magical once all their charges or uses are expended, such as the gem of brightness or restorative ointment.


Absorption
At 6th level, your precise control over vril allows you to absorb the power of others to enhance your own. Whenever you take damage from a spell or magical effect that isn’t bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing, you take the damage as normal, and you can use your reaction to absorb some of the effect’s magical energy. When you do so, make a Constitution saving throw. The DC equals 10 or half the damage you took, whichever number is higher. 
On a success, you store that magical energy within your 
blood for 1 minute. Before the duration ends, you can expend this stored energy (no action required) to enhance one spell of 1st level or higher that you cast. The enhanced spell is cast as if you expended a spell slot one level higher than the spell slot you expended.


Y ou can absorb magical energy in this way a number
of times equal to your proficiency bonus. Y ou regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.


Overload
Starting at 10th level, your ability to channel your life force into raw arcane power grows. When you deal damage to a creature with a wizard spell, you can expend one or more of your Hit Dice. Roll the expended Hit Dice and add your Constitution modifier to the roll. The creature takes extra force damage equal to the total. If more than one creature takes damage from the spell you cast, you choose which creature takes this extra damage.


Suppress
At 14th level, you can use an action to suppress the vril energy of one creature or magic item you can see. The suppression lasts 1 minute, until you lose concentration on it (as if you were concentrating on a spell), or until you can no longer see the target.
If the suppressed target is a creature, each time it 
attempts to cast a spell or use a magical effect while suppressed, it must make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. On a success, the spell or effect happens normally. On a failure, the spell or effect doesn’t happen, and the creature loses the spell slot or effect’s use, if the effect’s use is limited.
If the suppressed target is a magic item, it functions 
as a nonmagical item of its type for the duration of your suppression. This effect otherwise works like the magic items aspect of the antimagic field spell.


Backgrounds
From those born under auspicious cosmic events to physicians tending plague victims, this section contains new backgrounds for a variety of characters.


COMETBORN
Cometborn are individuals born under the passing of a comet. The event magically changed them, instilling in them memories from before they were born. These memories are fragments of various events and people that existed in the world in some of the previous times the comet passed overhead. Cometborn are aware these memories are not their own but find comfort in the memories nonetheless. They often turn to these memories in times of stress or uncertainty, seeking—and often finding—answers to their current plight. This connection to the past makes cometborn seem “wise beyond their years” and leads many to lives of historical study or to advisory roles among their peers. This connection also gives cometborn an innate sense of people, able to read others and easily detect patterns in behavior. 
Skill Proficiencies: History, InsightTool Proficiencies: One type of artisan’s tools or one type 
of musical instrument
Languages: Primordial and one other language of your 
choice
Equipment: A shard from a meteorite or other cosmic 
object, a set of artisan’s tools or a musical instrument 
(one of your choice), a set of common clothes, and a pouch with 5 gp
FEATURE: FRAGMENTS OF THE PAST
Memories of the past fill your mind, always within easy reach should you need them. Whenever you face a difficult decision or great uncertainty, you can look to these memories for an answer. The answer might come in short flashes or glimpses into a similar situation viewed or experienced by someone in the past, but the answer is never a clear direction for the decision you must make. The memories provide you with a sensation of hope, foreboding, tranquility, despair, joy, indifference, or similar emotion around your planned course of action, hinting that the plan might lead to positive, negative, positive and negative, or neutral results. Y ou can consult your ancient memories in this way no more than once every 24 hours.

1 I will learn the truth about some past event hinted 
at in my memories and what it means. 
2 I will find others who are like me. 
3 I will obtain the secrets of powerful figures and use them to my advantage.

The memory fragments in the cometborn’s mind often 
leave them feeling apart from those around them, as 
they know and understand things they shouldn’t or that 
others take years to learn. As a result, some cometborn 
tend toward being charismatic and gregarious, overcompensating for any awkwardness they feel  they might exhibit, while others become paranoid 
 and reclusive, shutting themselves off from others  
to avoid being hurt.

CURIO COLLECTOR
Curio collectors are obsessed with collecting alchemical 
ingredients, spell components, and other small oddities. They travel the world in search of the rarest of these to add to their collections. Not all curio collectors are spellcasters, though many are. They might be caring and generous community leaders who want to facilitate magic in their community or quiet and withdrawn owners of a curio shop stuffed with oddities both practical and decorative. The curio collector is always proud of their collections and is usually willing to show and maybe even share with those who take an interest.
Skill Proficiencies: Arcana, SurvivalTool Proficiencies: Alchemist’s supplies, cartographer’s 
tools
Equipment: A set of alchemist’s supplies or a set of 
cartographer’s tools (one of your choice), a notebook 
filled with ingredients and oddities you’ve collected or studied over the years, two over-the-shoulder belts with twenty small, leather pouches each, a set of common clothes, 10 gp worth of alchemical ingredients or spell components, and a belt pouch containing 5 gp
FEATURE: TRASH IS TREASURE
Y ou have spent years memorizing alchemical ingredients, spell components, and other hard-to-find ingredients and oddities under the tutelage of another collector or in the learned halls of an academy. Y ou immediately recognize when an object you perceive or handle is an ingredient or component for something, though you might not recall its exact application without further study. Y ou also have a general idea of its value in the markets where it would be most desired, estimating a value within 15 percent of the object’s actual value in those markets.SUGGESTED CHARACTERISTICS
Curio collectors are obsessive, detail-oriented individuals who are highly motivated to complete their collections.


They enjoy the hunt for rare ingredients and components
and take great care to maintain the object’s quality when 
collecting it. They might take risks to ensure the talon of some monstrous foe remains intact even as they work to defeat it. Curio collectors tend to have an excellent 
memory and are often able to recall details, especially 
about ingredients and their sources, that others might not.

PLAGUE DOCTOR
Plague doctors are the brave (and sometimes mad) 
members of a community who are willing to risk illness 
and injury in their efforts to heal the sick. Plague doctors 
are equal parts scholar, healer, and student of esoteric 
medical arts. Some attend academies as physicians 
only to find the long apprenticeships difficult to endure before taking their skills on the road. Others are healers following their community’s healing traditions. Still 
others are wandering scholars, collecting specimens and 
recording the characteristics of the foulest pestilences. 
The path of the plague doctor is often a lonely one; but personal motivation spurs them on to the next account of disease and illness.
Skill Proficiencies: Investigation, Medicine
Tool Proficiencies: Herbalism kit
Languages: One of your choiceEquipment: A leather mask of any style with lenses over 
the eyes and filtered nose and mouth holes, a leather 
overcoat, an herbalism kit, six glass vials, and a pouch containing 10 gp
FEATURE: ESOTERIC PHYSICIAN


Y our training allows you to treat diseases without the aid
of magic or prayers. Y ou can spend one hour tending to 
a creature to place it in your care until it finishes a long 
rest. Y ou can have up to four creatures in your care at a 
time. While in your care, a creature can perform only 
light activities and rest; otherwise, the creature loses the 
benefits of your care and can’t be placed in your care again 
for the next 24 hours. A creature that finishes a long rest 
while in your care has advantage on the next saving throw 
it makes against a disease it is suffering.

41
CHAPTER 1 CHARACTER OPTIONSSUGGESTED CHARACTERISTICS
Plague doctors are both brave and curious. Though their 
training strays toward the esoteric, plague doctors are 
intelligent and motivated learners. Some may be cold 
and analytical scholars of pestilence, while others are 
inspired to heal the afflicted. In their darkest moments, a plague doctor is a detached spectator to suffering, struggling to feel for others through the thick skin their 
profession has provided.

STORYTELLER
Storytellers serve a multitude of purposes within their community. Some storytellers act as historians, keeping memories and traditions alive through generations.


Others see stories as the perfect vehicle for imparting
wisdom and lessons to those in need of such things. 
Still other storytellers are entertainers, keeping 
crowds and distinguished guests rapt. The stories kept by storytellers can range in importance from a simple, cautionary tale to a secret, 
magical ritual. As adventurers, storytellers 
seek to transform their exploits into crafted 
tales to serve as they see fit.
Skill Proficiencies: History, PerformanceTool Proficiencies: Calligrapher’s suppliesLanguages: One of your choiceEquipment: A set of calligrapher’s supplies, 
a leather-bound journal containing your 
stories, three bottles of ink, six quills, 
a set of common clothes, and a pouch 
containing 10 gp
FEATURE: STORIES
Wherever you go, you amass stories. 
Some stories change over time, and some are 
immutable as bedrock. Y ou keep your stories in a 
large, leather -bound book filled with scribbles and drops 
of ink. Alternatively, your stories are fixed in your mind, and for each story, you carry a small object to help you 
remember it. The object might be a souvenir from the 
event that inspired your story, a memento from the 
person who first taught you the story, a multi-faceted 
device whose many faces you count off as you tell each 
part of the story, or similar.If you spend at least one hour telling a story to an 
audience, you can receive minor gifts of appreciation for 
the story. These gifts are appropriate to the gift giver’s social and economic standing: a child might gift you a handful of picked wildflowers or a shiny rock they found, a passing noble captivated by your story might give you a few coins, or an innkeeper might gift you a discounted or free meal or room for entertaining their guests with your story. Alternatively, you can spend four hours telling stories at different locations within an urban center and earn enough to accommodate a modest lifestyle for that day. Regardless of the number of stories you tell in a day, you can earn these gifts from no more than one story each day, and you can earn enough to accommodate only a modest lifestyle each day.

43
CHAPTER 1 CHARACTER OPTIONSWhen crafting your stories, think about the story’s 
purpose and themes. Is it a historical recounting of a great 
feat among your people? Is it a tale of foolishness and wisdom meant to impart some lesson on its listener? Is it purely for entertainment with plenty of jokes and antics? Is it about overcoming obstacles or discovering a great truth? At the GM’s discretion, a story with a theme and purpose that aligns closely with the audience listening to the story might lead to larger gifts, might supply you with a comfortable lifestyle that day, or might earn you other campaign-specific rewards, such as earning the trust of a people or bolstering the morale of troops before a battle.


SUGGESTED CHARACTERISTICS
Storytellers consider themselves craftspeople similar to masons or blacksmiths. They are often outgoing if somewhat self-serious. While often charming, a storyteller’s tendency to see events as material for their next tale can strain some friendships and detach them slightly from the reality of a situation.

DEEP MAGIC VOLUME 2


This chapter provides both an overview of how to use
magic styles and details on existing styles commonly 
found in most magical settings.


What Are  Magic Styles
Magic styles are subsets of magic, each distinguished 
by a strong theme. A style includes descriptive and mechanical information that allows a caster to create a specialized relationship with their spellcasting. Adopting a magic style allows a character to explore their special brand of magic, giving their spells unique flourishes, similar to the way artists approach their work. Weaving different styles of magic into a campaign transforms spellcasting from a basic mechanic into a living, breathing part of a magical world.


Magic styles are not limited to drawing from a single
school, and they utilize many different mechanical 
elements, often encompassing spells from multiple 
schools and including magic items, feats, and more to weave together into a more complete magical toolkit.


How to Use  This Section
Each magic style in this section contains the following 
core elements—and frequently more—to give players the means to create characters that incorporate the style’s flavor.
Overview. Each magic style starts with a description 
of the style’s core theme and provides ideas for how the particular style might fit into a fantasy world.
Recommended Spell List. Suggested lists are provided, 
containing new spells (further detailed in Chapter 5) and those from the core game that would work well for characters interested in adopting a particular magic style. Y ou will note that these spells are not restricted to certain Styles of Magic
45
CHAPTER 2 STYLES OF MAGIC
schools of magic, which is intentional in order to broaden 
the versatility of each magic style. The spells included on 
these lists are also not restricted by individual class spell lists. If you are interested in pursuing a particular style, consider asking your GM to allow access to all the spells presented on the recommended spell list—even if they wouldn’t typically be available for your character class.


Style Descriptions
This section presents an array of magic styles suitable for 
use in any fantasy setting. Quick descriptions of each style are listed here:
• Battle Magic is high-utility magic that harmoniously 
works with the precision and focus necessary to survive combat. Practitioners of battle magic are warriors first and magicians second, tending to view magic as a tool rather than an integral part of their identity.
• Doom Magic draws power from the unstoppable forces of entropy and decay. Its practitioners frequently adopt this style in an effort to subvert—or expedite—impending apocalyptic events.
• Dream Magic is cerebral magic that draws power from the subconscious. Dream magic requires deep introspection and understanding of the collective unconscious that links all beings. 
• Fey Magic is the sometimes whimsical and always strange magic naturally employed by fey creatures.
 
Casters who emulate the twisting powers of faerie favor the use of misdirection and distraction to achieve their goals, and they often have a fondness for mischief.
• Hedge Magic harnesses the properties of the natural world to enact subtle changes in the environment. While magical scholars largely regard it as little more than common household alchemy, its practitioners know that unlocking true power takes daily and continuous effort nurturing one’s affinity for what the world around you has to offer.
• Pestilent Magic  is potent magic that manipulates the 
biology of living creatures—to heal or to harm. Casters who pursue this often possess a macabre fascination with death and intuitively understand that true devastation starts with a whisper rather than a scream
.
• Portal Magic is highly mathematical magic centered on the manipulation of space. Regarded as one of the most dangerous styles of magic, few casters possess the incredible precision necessary to safely—and repeatedly—bend one of the core principles of reality to their will.
• Pyromancy is just one type of elemental magic. The desire to control the volatile element of flame is almost universally sought after, and the practice of pyromancy is as rich and well-studied as any style. Mages who pursue pyromancy understand that true power comes from serving as a conduit to the awesome forces of the universe, rather than seeking to dominate them.
• Ritual Magic is the most complex form of spellcasting and the style with the greatest potential to alter the cosmos on a grand scale. Preparedness is everything for ritual casters, so strategy and patience are two virtues critical to pursuit of this style.
• Saint’s Magic is divine magic that draws power from the spark of divinity found within remarkable mortal creatures, rather than distant gods or angels. Those who practice this style rarely choose it and are instead drawn to it by intense devotion to their beliefs.
• Shadow Magic allows casters to draw on the mysterious unsettling energy inherent in darkness and turn it to their own uses.
• Spirit Magic practitioners are master manipulators of the supernatural forces beneath the veil of the material world. Their relationships with the spirits who dwell at the heart of all things allow them to enact extraordinary effects and gain supernatural awareness.
• True Name Magic requires mastery over the primal building blocks of language. Casters who study true names explore the unique intersection between creation, identity, and the arcane. 
• Weather Magic focuses on a caster’s ability to 
reshape, enhance, and reconfigure the bounteous energy of existing natural forces. Practitioners of weather magic hone their awareness to perceive even minor atmospheric changes that could be used to their advantage.


CREATING YOUR OWN STYLE
If you don’t see a magic style that perfectly fits your 
character concept, you can create your own using the 
following steps:
• Start by creating a clear concept and then make sure 
it fits the game world (though players should consult 
their GMs first).
• Think about where your unique style comes from 
and who else in the world might practice it. Laying 
foundations about its history and invention can help 
make your creation feel like an exciting new piece of a campaign setting.
• Create a signature spell list of “must have” spells or monstrous traits that will allow you to show off your 
concept at the table.
46
DEEP MAGIC VOLUME 2BATTLE MAGIC
Let the war mages stand atop the walls, sheltered by the 
crenels of stone and mortar. They have their place, and the battle mages have theirs—in the heart of the fray where they hear the sounds of battle as song. One that rises and falls as tooth meets shield and sword meets bone. These battle mages lead this song with their magic, directing it to serve both themselves and their allies. A perfect victory exists for them, and they will find it somewhere between the cries of their enemies and the intonations of their magic.


Those who practice battle magic do not view fighting
with swords or sorcery as separate paths but rather as a logical marriage of the mighty. For them, arcane magic can be picked up and wielded as if it were a weapon, and honing the body to control it is just as important—if not more so—than honing the mind. Battle magic is often direct and reactive out of necessity. Its spells are meant to be used during intense conflict, and consequently, their appearance is far removed from the droning litanies of priests or the complex rituals of wizards. While battle mages may have little in common with other practitioners, they are an undeniable asset on the field of combat, and the intense movement that accompanies their spellwork is the epitome of grace.

Magic Tower
Prerequisite: Ability to Cast at Least One Spell, Strength 13  
or Higher
Y ou have trained as a guardian, ready to use both sword and spell to better defend your allies on the field of battle. Y ou gain the following benefits:
• Y ou gain proficiency with heavy armor.
• Y ou may use a shield as your spellcasting focus.
• When you or an ally within 10 feet of you are hit by a ranged weapon or spell attack, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage taken by 1d10 + your spellcasting modifier. Heart of the Fray
Prerequisite: Ability to Cast at Least One Spell, Dexterity 13  
or Higher
Y ou have trained as a striker, a hard-hitting warrior whose focus increases the closer you are to the front lines of a fight. As long as you are within 30 feet of a hostile creature, you can take a bonus action on your turn to take the Dodge action. 
Additionally, if you take damage from a melee attack 
after using the Dodge action, but before the start of your next turn, you can use your reaction to cast a spell at the attacker. The spell must have a casting time of 1 action and have a range of touch.
MAGIC ITEMS: ARMAMENTS


OF THE BATTLE MAGE
For millennia, magical societies have relied on battle mages to ensure victorious warfare. Such places have developed equipment suited to the unique fighting style employed by their war casters.


Blade of the Battle Seer
Weapon (Any Sword), Rare (Requires Attunement by  
a Spellcaster)
This sword shifts and phases in and out in the hands of its wielder. These rare blades offer diviners a powerful weapon on the front lines of combat. Y ou gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magical weapon. 
Fate Slice. If you know at least one spell from the 
divination school, whenever you hit with an attack using this weapon, you may use your reaction to expend a spell slot. If you do, that creature has disadvantage on its attack rolls until the end of its next turn.


Axe of the Evocator
Weapon (Any Axe), Rare (Requires Attunement by  
a Spellcaster)
This axe is ensorcelled by changing elemental magical auras. Flame, electricity, water, and earth crackle and drip from the axe’s head and handle. Y ou gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magical weapon. 
Biting Element. If you know at least one spell from the 
evocation school, whenever you hit with an attack using this weapon, choose one evocation spell you know. The damage of the attack changes to the damage type of that spell. (If the spell possesses multiple types, choose one.)
Thane’s Hauberk
Armor (Breastplate), Rare (Requires Attunement by a Bard)
The front and back of this steel breastplate are covered in sigils that crackle with lightning. Y ou have a +1 bonus to AC while wearing this breastplate.


Whenever you are struck by a melee attack while
wearing the breastplate, you may use your reaction to expend one use of your uses of Bardic Inspiration. If you 

48
DEEP MAGIC VOLUME 2do, roll your Bardic Inspiration die twice: you reduce the 
damage of the attack by the result of the first roll, and the triggering target takes lightning damage equal to the result of the second roll.


CREATURE TRAITS
Y ou can create a themed version of an existing creature by giving it one or more of the following traits or actions:
• Arcane Armor. Increase the AC of this creature by 2 and 
its CR by 1. When this creature takes damage from an attack, it can use its reaction to gain resistance to the triggering damage type until the end of its next turn.
• Ensorcelled. Weapon attacks made by this creature do force damage. Melee weapons (including natural 
weapons like fists, teeth, and claws) emit dim light to a 
range of 10 feet. The light is a color of your choosing.
• Mage’s Mobility. The creature learns one cantrip 
that requires a spell attack, and whenever it takes the Disengage action, it can choose to cast it. Its attack bonus equals its highest ability modifier + its proficiency bonus.
GRIMOIRE OF THE BATTLE MAGE:


THE ART OF COMBAT
This practically sized, no-nonsense grimoire resembles field notes more than a traditional spellbook. The warm-brown leather cover is stamped with a simple sword-shaped decoration and held closed by a copper clasp. As the book has changed hands, each master has contributed their own notations distilling the wisdom learned in their tenure in battle. The first page contains a single notation and nothing else: Whenever you wield the sword, it should be in pursuit of a future where you need not wield it again.


The Art of Combat
most recently came into the possession 
of the warrior monks of Cyzses, who keep the tome under guard in their remote mountain monastery. However, rumors have begun to circulate that the grimoire, along with several other potent tomes, was recently stolen from the monastery. The monks vehemently deny such claims.


Grimoire Adventure Hooks
The grimoire can act as a potent reward for characters or serve as a plot device in adventures. Below are several hooks to utilize it in a campaign: 
• Inheritance. A retired adventurer wills the grimoire to one of the characters upon their death. Unfortunately, 
the PC also inherits the ire of a group of warrior -monks 
who are determined to slay whoever possesses the book—unless they prove themselves worthy of its knowledge. 
• Prince. When an inexperienced leader suddenly ascends 
to the throne in the midst of a war, his advisors hire the party to retrieve the grimoire for their new master. Unfortunately, the grimoire is rumored to be held in a vault guarded by the spirits of legendary warriors. • Wargames. The countryside is ravaged as war breaks out between two goblin warlords. The uneasy peace that once existed between the two factions seems to have broken when one of the leaders found the grimoire and invoked the jealousy of the other.


The Art of Combat
Wondrous Item, Fabled (5th-Level and Higher Properties 
Require Attunement by a Spellcaster)


The Art of Combat  is a journal filled with countless strategies
concerning the marriage of might and magic. The bearer of this fabled tome is filled with the poise, ingenuity, and focus cultivated by generations of battle mages.
While holding the book, you can use it as a spellcasting 
focus for your spells, and it functions as a spellbook for you. Additionally, if you fail a concentration check to maintain a spell while holding the book, you can choose to succeed instead. Once triggered, this property can’t be used again until you complete a long rest. 
When found, the book contains the following spells. 
Spells marked with an asterisk (*) appear in Chapter 5:
1st level: concussive punch*, Hemmen’s low blow*2nd level: magic weapon, strafe*3rd level: nimble dance*4th level: bark bulwark*, mass disarm*5th level: wreck*6th level: thresh the battlefield*7th level: phantasmal phalanx*
Soldier’s Stratagem (Requires Attunement). As your 
level increases, you gain the following benefits while the 
grimoire is on your person.
5th level. Y ou have advantage on initiative rolls. 
Whenever you roll initiative, you can choose to swap your initiative roll with a willing creature who also rolled initiative. Y ou must do so before combat begins.
9th level. When an ally you can see takes damage from 
a creature’s weapon attack, you can use your reaction to make one weapon attack against that creature or move 10 feet directly toward that creature.

CHAPTER 2 STYLES OF MAGIC
VARIANT: APOCALYPSE MAGIC
Doom magic is known by many names, including  
apocalypse magic, which refers to a small portion of the 
larger umbrella that is doom magic. Whenever you see 
such titles in a Kobold Press product, they are merely one facet of the ruinous forces that define the doom 
magic style.13th level. Once per long rest, you can push yourself 
beyond your normal limits and take one additional action 
on your turn. This feature can be used on the same turn as Action Surge if you have access to that feature.
17th level. When an ally you can see is reduced to 0 hit 
points but not killed outright, you can choose to enter a state of resolve. While in this state, any conditions affecting you end, and you can immediately expend any number of Hit Dice to recover hit points. 
Quirks of the Art of Combat. While attuned to the 
grimoire, you occasionally experience the emotions and 
attitudes of its previous owners, who have left their psychic 
imprint upon it. While you are not compelled to act on these feelings, you might randomly experience one of the quirks presented in the Quirks of the Art of Combat table
.


QUIRKS OF THE ART OF COMBAT
d8 Result
1 Y ou obsessively polish your armor and sharpen 
your weapons.
2 Y ou can’t stand to sit with your back to a door or other points of entry.

5 Y ou quickly lose your patience with people who talk too much.
6 Y ou have yet to meet a weapon you didn’t want to take home.
7 Y ou always rise with the sun, even if you don’t  want to.
8 Y ou tend to use tactical language, even when discussing mundane subjects.


DOOM MAGIC
Entropy is sometimes seen as synonymous with death 
and the end of days. In truth, it’s a facet of nature as inescapable as the four elements and the laws of alchemy. 
Doomsday cults relish the approaching apocalypse, 
espousing love while threatening damnation for 
unbelievers, and the powerful threaten to tear down all of 
civilization just to add a new province to their realms.
Doom magic isn’t widely practiced, largely because its 
inherent destructiveness is widely misunderstood. Due to its general rejection by civilization, its practitioners are 
more common in villainous factions as devotees of dark 
lords, emissaries of hostile interplanar beings, leaders of 
vicious cults, and a host of other groups willing and ready 
to weave apocalyptic forces.


When and where this branch of magic originated is
unknown. Some scholars see it as the ultimate expression 
of natural law, while others consider it a divine gift or the manifestation of a chaotic deity’s will. Whatever its source, doom magic’s potential to harm, weaken, terrify, and empower makes it one of the most dangerous magical arts.

CREATURE TRAITS
Y ou can create a themed version of an existing creature by 
giving it one or more of the following traits or actions:
• Doom’s Herald. Once per turn, when the creature hits with a weapon attack, you must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or gain 1 doom point. The DC equals 10 + the creature’s proficiency bonus. A creature possessing doom points reduces its saving throw rolls (including death saving throws) by its current number of doom points. Spells like remove curse and greater restoration can reduce a creature’s accumulated doom points by one. Otherwise, all doom points disappear when the creature completes a long rest.

51
CHAPTER 2 STYLES OF MAGIC
• Hate Sense. This creature knows the location of all 
creatures within 60 feet of it that aren’t constructs or undead.
• Visions of the End. The creature conjures visions of death to horrify its enemies as an action. Any creature within 60 feet that it can see must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of it for 1 minute. The DC equals 10 + the creature’s proficiency bonus. A frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
GRIMOIRE OF DOOM:


THE GRIM ENCHIRIDION
This black grimoire is covered with red geometric symbols and ornate flourishes. In the center of the front cover is a small hourglass filled with red sand, set into a circular indentation, and sealed by a thin layer of crystal. 
Death. Limbo. The infernal realms. The fear of what 
lies beyond the mortal coil sometimes leads to the unscrupulous reaching out to strange gods or elder things, begging to be saved from the inevitable. While some do manage to avoid fate by embracing lichdom or some other state of being, most simply die. Y et there are some who find a different path.
T erlynne Vanlon plied her trade in a large port city, 
cutting purses, picking pockets, and occasionally doing a bit of second-story work. Though barely more than a child, she learned her skills from her father, one of the greatest thieves in the city. However, he was growing older and not quite as sharp as he believed. He perished after the target of a failed pouch lift took exception to the aged thief and gutted him in the street while T erlynne watched from a nearby rooftop. In that moment, she realized that time is the real enemy and decided then and there to steal from time itself.
For years, T erlynne searched for a way. She apprenticed 
herself to mages, clerics, warlocks, and insane prophets, learning any magic or lore dealing with time. Finally, she journeyed to a dark tower in a broken wasteland and pledged herself to Timeless Urga. A chronomage, Urga taught T erlynne lost temporal arcana and performed sacrifices to a nameless patron. Two decades after beginning her quest, T erlynne betrayed her master, using his dying breath to open a portal to an unknown realm. She entered the glowing gateway, and nothing more is known of her fate.
The next morning, Urga’s other apprentices found Urga 
whole and quite alive—and holding a strange black tome. The chronomage informed them that T erlynne succeeded in her quest but gave them this warning: “Stealing time isn’t the difficult part. Surviving once you have it is the real trick.”Grimoire Adventure Hooks
The grimoire can act as a potent reward for characters or serve as a plot device in adventures. Below are several hooks to utilize it in a campaign: 
• Dance of Time. A rash of strange murders plagues the lower quarters of the city. The victims rapidly age before dying. The nobles and elite seem unconcerned, throwing lavish parties and fabulous masquerade balls while the poor huddle in terror. Father Joran, a common priest, hires the characters to put a stop to the murders. Does the answer have something to do with the strange longevity of the city’s upper crust?
• Stealing Time. Through diverse means, a patron of the characters has acquired a locked coffer rumored to contain the Grim Enchiridion. However, the Cult of Urga, a cruel sect of the chronomage’s original followers, will slaughter everyone between themselves and the tome. The characters must protect their patron in his manor from an assault of fanatical cultists and their demonic allies.
• Time to Kill. Attaining the Grim Enchiridion is much 
easier than keeping it. Time begins breaking down around the characters as creatures and events from the past and future collide in the present. Various groups blame the characters and their new tome. The best solution seems to be a temple dedicated to a deity of time, but can they survive the journey when time itself seems bent on their deaths?

If attuned to it, you can use the grimoire as a 
spellcasting focus, and it functions as a spellbook for you. 
The spells listed below count as spells for your spellcasting class. Moreover, while this tome is in your possession, you are immune to spells and effects that magically age you, and when you read it, you have advantage on any check to recall a fact, action, or event you heard or performed in your past. 
When found, the book contains the following spells.

Thief of Time (Requires Attunement). As your level 
increases, you gain the following benefits while the 
grimoire is on your person. Saving throws for its features 
equal your spellcasting DC.
5th level. Y
ou double your proficiency bonus on 
Intelligence (Arcana) checks involving the nature of time. 
Moreover, as a reaction when combat begins, you can 
choose for one creature you can see to make a Wisdom 
saving throw. On a failed save, the target exchanges its 
initiative result with another creature of your choice. When you reach 10th level, you can target up to two 
creatures with this feature, and at 15th level, you can 
target up to three creatures.
9th level. When you hit with an attack that targets only 
one creature, you can choose to deal no damage. If you do so, the target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw 
or be unable to take a bonus action, action, or reaction 
(your choice) on its next turn. Before the end of your next 
turn, you can take one bonus action, action, or reaction, 
whichever the target was unable to take. Once used, this 
feature shouldn’t be used again until you finish a long rest 
(see the T emporal Backlash feature).
13th level. Y our Intelligence score increases by 2, to 
a maximum of 20. In addition, you can reach into the 
future to steal fragments of time from hundreds of your 
future selves. When you do so, you can use an action to 
give an additional action to a number of allies within 60 
feet equal to your proficiency bonus. Y our allies can use 
this additional action immediately as a reaction or as an 
action on their turn, their choice. Once used, this feature shouldn’t be used again until you finish a long rest (see the 
T emporal Backlash feature).
17th level. Y ou are immune to magic that manipulates 
or freezes time. In addition, when you cast a spell that targets only one creature, you can choose to hold the results of the spell outside of time. Y ou do not need to specify a target for the spell at the time of casting, but casting the spell still requires an action and expends a spell slot. Otherwise, the stored spell has no effect. Y ou can hold up to three spells in this way. Y ou can use an action to expunge all of your stored spells at the same time, adjudicating each spell individually. If you do not use your stored spells after 1 minute, the spells vanish from your mind and are wasted. Once used, this feature shouldn’t be used again until you finish a long rest (see the T emporal Backlash feature).
Temporal Backlash. By attuning to this item, you can 
use some of the powers without risk, but you can also push past the bounds of safety as long as you are willing to accept the consequences. The 9th-level, 13th-level and 17th-level features of this grimoire are regained when you finish a long rest. However, you can choose to use one of these features again after the first time, but you will suffer temporal backlash for doing so. Each time you use one of these features beyond the first time, you reduce your maximum Hit Dice by 2 for 24 hours. For example, if you use the 13th-level feature three times before finishing a long rest, when you finish your next long rest, your maximum Hit Dice is four less than normal. 
Quirks of the Enchiridion. While attuned to the 
grimoire, you occasionally experience the emotions and 
attitudes of its previous owners, who have left their psychic 
imprint upon it. While you are not compelled to act on these feelings, you might randomly experience one of the quirks presented in the Quirks of the Enchiridion table
.

CHAPTER 2 STYLES OF MAGICDREAM MAGIC


Practitioners of dream magic have learned to quiet the
noise of their senses and to trust their intuition to perceive the truths that lie beneath the surface. They have learned to embrace the bizarre and beautiful ways the mind makes sense of the world and aren’t afraid to dive into the most secret corridors of the self.


Though dream magic may lack the sound and fury of
other styles of magic, mages who pursue it understand that there is far more power to be gleaned from imagination and emotion than most creatures realize. Dreams, by their nature, are explorations of the primal fears and desires that dwell deep within every being’s unconscious mind. T apping into these secret truths is the heart of dream magic. Spells from this style always look inward, helping creatures find what has been lost, manipulating deep-rooted emotional drives, or exploiting secret fears locked in the dark corners of the mind.

MAGIC ITEMS: TEARS OF THE DREAMER
This section presents unique items that harness the power of dream magic.


TEARS OF THE DREAMER
Wondrous Item, Rarity V aries by Color


This tear-shaped gemstone is roughly the size of an adult
human’s palm. Though cold to the touch, it hums with mystical vitality, and fleeting images can be glimpsed along its surface. Y ou may spend a short rest meditating on the images within, and during your meditation, you experience a memory held within the gem, as determined by the GM. When you complete the meditation, you gain a proficiency that lasts until you complete a long rest (as detailed in the T ears of the Dreamer table). Only one creature can gain the benefit of a particular gem at a time, and once a gem has granted its benefit, it cannot do so again until the next dawn. 
Additionally, the gem can be ground into a fine dust that 
can be used in place of the spell components of equivalent monetary value. Doing so destroys the gem. The worth of the gem dust is noted in the chart below. If the spell consumes the spell components, it instead consumes the equivalent value of dust.CREATURE TRAITS
Y ou can create a themed version of an existing creature by giving it one or more of the following traits or actions:
• Incorporeal Movement. The creature can move through other creatures and objects. It takes 5 (1d10) 
force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.
• Invisibility. As an action, the creature magically 
turns invisible until it chooses to end the effect. The 
invisibility ends early if the creature attacks or casts a spell. Any equipment the creature wears or carries is also invisible.
• Waking Dream. The creature is immune to any 
effects that would put it to sleep or cause it to become 
unconscious.
GRIMOIRE OF DREAMS: BEDFELLOW
The cover of this grimoire is covered by thick, tufted fabric 
decorated with opalescent buttons—making it suitable for 
use as both a spellbook and a pillow. A removable, satin 
eye mask is attached to the book’s spine. Though the book is filled with entries clearly penned by different authors, every entry is signed with a single word: Bedfellow.
Bedfellow’s peculiar nature makes its history difficult 
to track, but the strange events that occur whenever the book surfaces are well-documented. Upon the death of its owner, Bedfellow has a habit of phasing out of existence for a random stretch of time before reappearing somewhere else on the Material Plane, usually in a place where it has a high probability of being found. Bedfellow seems to prefer owners capable of great imagination, and it has often caused great trouble by placing itself in the hands of children or creatures who—intentionally or unintentionally—reject societal norms.


Grimoire Adventure Hooks
The grimoire can act as a potent reward for characters or serve as a plot device in adventures. Below are several hooks to utilize it in a campaign: 
• Dead Asleep. A criminal is using Bedfellow’s powers to murder victims through their dreams. As the body count rises, authorities seek outside help to put a stop to the bizarre string of deaths. 
• Distress Signal. The book and its current owner are kidnapped by a cult intent on awakening a slumbering 
elder evil. In an effort to be rescued, the book causes 
every creature within 100 miles of it to experience 
dreams that provide clues to its location.
• Rhinoceros. Shortly after the appearance of the grimoire in a public library, an entire town falls into chaos as its citizens begin to believe they are wild 
beasts. The characters must find the book and discover 
a way to reverse its influence before the townsfolk 
destroy themselves.
55
CHAPTER 2 STYLES OF MAGICGrimoire of Dreams: Bedfellow
Wondrous Item, Fabled (5th-Level and Higher Properties 
Require Attunement by a Spellcaster)
Bedfellow contains a mix of firsthand retellings of dreams, 
peculiar stories, haunting lullabies, and meditations on the symbolism of dreams. Any creature—other than the book’s owner—who attempts to read its contents quickly finds themselves lulled into a deep sleep full of incredibly vivid dreams. 
While holding the book, you can use it as a spellcasting 
focus for your spells, and it functions as a spellbook for you. Additionally, if you use the book as a pillow, you can reduce your exhaustion by two instead of one when you complete a long rest. Also, any creature sleeping on Bedfellow can’t be affected by magically induced nightmares or targeted by spells like dream while they remain asleep—unless they choose to be affected by them.
When found, the book contains the following spells.

Bedfellow (Requires Attunement). As your level 
increases, you gain the following benefits while the 
grimoire is on your person. 
5th level. When you fail an ability check, you can instead 
choose to succeed as you recall a dream in which you succeeded at a similar task. Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you complete a long rest. 
9th level. As an action, you can cause a Medium or 
smaller creature or object to appear in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you. The creature or object appears exactly how it appeared in your imagination before you caused it to appear, including the way it looks, feels, smells, sounds, and tastes.A creature created in this way can speak, move, and 
perform other simple tasks you imagine it could do, but it can’t think for itself, cast spells, or attack. It acts on your turn in combat, and if it must make a roll of any kind, it uses your statistics. If the creature takes any damage, or suffers an effect that would harm a normal creature of its kind, it instantly disappears.


An object created in this way can perform all the
functions it normally could, but if it is wielded in a way that would cause a normal object to deal damage, it takes any damage, or it suffers any effect that would break or destroy a normal object of its kind, it instantly disappears.
A creature or object created by this spell lasts for 1 hour, 
until it is forced to disappear, or until you choose to dismiss it (no action required). If you ever move more than 60 feet away from the creature or object, it instantly disappears. 
Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you 
complete a short or long rest.

advantage on saving throws to resist effects that would cause you to become charmed or frightened.TEARS OF THE DREAMER

FEY MAGIC
Practitioners of fey magic have extensively studied or 
experienced the twisting magic employed by fey creatures. The spells in their repertoire are often perceived similarly to the fey creatures who inspire them: dismissed as matters of simple mischief and harmless trickery. But they are no such fool. They understand better than anyone how flashy showmanship, honeyed words, and disarming gifts can happily lead a creature off a cliff ’s edge.
Fey creatures are born of raw primordial energy, so their 
magic often demonstrates the extremes that form the building blocks of the natural world. Spells of this style often enhance, deprive, or confound the senses, distilling
 
real experiences into more intense or exaggerated versions.RECOMMENDED SPELL LIST

CHAPTER 2 STYLES OF MAGICCREATURE TRAITS


Y ou can create a themed version of an existing creature by
giving it one or more of the following traits or actions:
• Beast Friend (1/Day). As an action, the creature summons four beasts of CR 2 or lower that appear in unoccupied spaces within 60 feet of it. The beasts act on their own initiative, but they obey all commands issued to them by the creature (no action required). Each beast disappears when it drops to 0 hit points.
• Pixie Dust. The creature gains a flying speed of 30 feet. If it already has a flying speed, it increases by 30 feet.
• Unseelie Blessing. The creature has advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can’t put it to sleep.
• Wild Heart. At the beginning of each of the creature’s turns, it can use a bonus action to roll a d20. If it rolls lower than its Constitution ability score, it regains hit points equal to its Constitution modifier.
GRIMOIRE OF THE FEY:


THE PERENNIAL FLORILEGIUM
Fat glowing fireflies hover lazily above the pale yellow, white, and red flowers that sprout from green moss covering this odd tome. A green ceramic clasp shaped like a frog secures the covers. The heady scent of the blooms mostly obscures the metallic undercurrent of blood.
T o some scholars, the Perennial Florilegium is a priceless 
lexicon for the study of flora, while to others, it is a cursed gift of the fey courts. Originally penned by a fey lord with a particular interest in gardening, the Florilegium was owned 
by mortals and immortals alike across the planes until it came into the possession of Mad Gwen Maelgwn.
Once a simple druid priestess, Gwen Maelgwn thought 
her destiny was to help care for her grove with the other members of her circle. However, a devastating attack by a rampaging hoard of giants left the forest burned to the ground, the druids slaughtered, and only Gwen left alive. Where other minds might have snapped, Gwen’s turned to revenge. She emerged from the ruins of her home with nothing but the Florilegium and trailed after the hoard. As the tales tell it, she took her vengeance giant by giant, killing them with strange plants until none remained.
Over the past few years, Mad Gwen Maelgwn has 
retreated to a new forest in a remote wilderness. There she cultivates plants from across the planes. No longer adhering to her druidic origins, she uses arcana to combine plants and animals into new and often horrific varieties. Wholly disinterested in the outside world, she nonetheless allows a trading village called Argosy to 

58
DEEP MAGIC VOLUME 2thrive at the edge of her forest. Alchemists and mages 
flock to the community, drawn by the allure of rare and exotic components found nowhere but in Mad Maelgwn’s Woods.


Grimoire Adventure Hooks
The grimoire can act as a potent reward for characters or serve as a plot device in adventures. Below are several hooks to utilize it in a campaign: 
• Immortality Orchid. Somewhere within the pages of the Florilegium is detailed the location of the Bright Lord’s Orchid, an exceedingly rare flower rumored to bestow everlasting life. The characters are hired by a rather suspicious ambassador to get this information (or they already have the grimoire in their possession) and acquire the orchid. However, elite agents of the Bright Lord work to eliminate anyone who seeks the orchid. 
• In the Court of the Fey. After acquiring the Florilegium, the characters are abducted by the fey and put on trial for murder! Someone killed the son of the fey lord, and evidence unmistakably points to flowers produced by the grimoire. Can the characters uncover the true murderer and clear their name while navigating the particularities of a fey court?
• Overgrown Revenge. A large city often frequented by the characters suddenly has a gardening problem. In the space of a night, trees, vines, flowers, and a host of dangerous flora fill the metropolis. With the entire city paralyzed by the rampaging plant life, the characters 
must venture into the “urban jungle” where a furious druid has used the Florilegium to enact nature’s revenge. 
Grimoire of the Fey: The Perennial Florilegium
Wondrous Item, Fabled (5th-Level and Higher Properties 
Require Attunement by a Spellcaster)
This tome is a florilegium (or book of flowers), detailing all manner of flowers found on the plane, including beautiful illustrations in vibrant colors. The living flowers on its cover are not easily plucked but can be removed with effort. A plucked flower crumbles to dust after 1 minute. On the next dawn, provided the grimoire is set upon natural soil the night before, new blossoms rapidly grow to replace any plucked flowers. The patterns on the cover adjust to new configurations each time a flower is removed. The owner of the Florilegium gradually becomes fixated on finding flowers and cross-referencing the specimens with the knowledge in the book. 
If attuned to it, you can use the grimoire as a 
spellcasting focus, and it functions as a spellbook for you. The spells listed below count as spells for your spellcasting class. Moreover, you have advantage on Intelligence checks made to interact with or recall information concerning plant and fey creatures.When found, the book contains the following spells.

Wellspring of the Garden (Requires Attunement). As 
your level increases, you gain the following benefits while 
the grimoire is on your person. Saving throws for its features equal your spellcasting DC.
5th level. Y ou learn the spell speak with plants and can 
cast it once without expending a spell slot. Y ou regain the ability to cast it in this way when you finish a long rest. In addition, as an action, you create a number of companion flowers up to your proficiency bonus. A companion flower is a tall, sunflower-like blossom with white and yellow petals. It is a stationary object with AC 15 and 30 hit points. Each flower appears in an unoccupied space you can see within 60 feet of you and lasts for 1 minute.
The flower has the following benefits, as well as others 
gained at higher levels:
• Curative Pollen. Whenever a friendly creature (or you) moves into a space within 5 feet of the flower for the first time on its turn or starts its turn there, it heals 2d6 hit points by breathing in the pollen (no action required). When the flowers (as a group) have healed a total of 30 hit points, they stop producing pollen.
Once you use this feature, you must finish a long rest 
before you can use it again.

CHAPTER 2 STYLES OF MAGIC9th level. Y our Curative Pollen can now heal up to 60 
hit points. In addition, your flowers gain the following 
new benefit:
• Carnivorous Snap. Each flower’s petals merge into

Any creature hostile to you that moves to a space within 10 feet of a flower for the first time on its turn must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 20 radiant damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. The flowers (as a group) stop attacking after they deal a combined total of 60 damage.
13th level. Y our Curative Pollen can now heal up to 70

• Burning Fireflies. A flame-shrouded firefly hovers 
around each of your flowers. As a bonus action, you can mentally command one of your flowers to send its burning firefly streaking toward one creature or object within 60 feet of it. When you do, make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the target takes 4d12 radiant damage. Whether you hit or miss, the firefly is expended. 
17th level. Y our Curative Pollen can now heal up to 80 
hit points, and the Carnivorous Snap can deal a total of 80 damage. In addition, your flowers gain the following new benefit:
• Razorpetal Barrage. Some petals of your flowers are wreathed in shimmering energy and become impossibly sharp. As a bonus action, you can mentally command your flowers to send petals hurtling at a point within 120 feet of it. Each creature in a 40-foot-radius of that point must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 10d12 force damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. Y our flowers have enough petals for one use of Razorpetal Barrage.

HEDGE MAGIC STYLE
At its core, hedge magic is found within the little rituals of 
life—our common and everyday needs. Many consider it to be little more than the tending of gardens and making of preparations in the kitchen and the like. But such alchemy is only one facet of hedge magic. Spells that ward the spellcaster and transfigure the world around them are also important parts of this discipline. It is a practical approach to magic on an often small and local scale, rather than a cosmic one.
Underrepresented in formal study, hedge magic is the 
most widely practiced yet least regarded of the arcane arts. Collegiate mages scoff at the notion that it be considered a true school of study, discounting it as little more than “kitchen-conjuring” and “garden alchemy.” But those who utilize it know that mastery isn’t about the recitation of dusty tomes in campus libraries or arcane theatrics of fire and frost. They know that it isn’t even about rare material components, words of power, or complex gestures. No, unlocking these secrets takes effort, dirt under nails and well-earned scrapes and bruises, continually nurturing one’s affinity for what the world around you has to offer. Some practitioners serve their communities with their skill in herbalism or by tutoring others. But whether leading the lives of familiar healers or reclusive witches, common folk often find reasons to fear hedge mages regardless, mistaking their arcane dedication for fearsome occultation. Other practitioners harness it for their own designs, embarking on quests of discovery, crusades, and even bids for dominion.

PLAYER OPTION: HEDGE MAGE


Spellcasters who use hedge magic call themselves hedge
mages, concerning themselves less with druidic rites, witchcraft, or arcana and more with the daily practice of developing their craft. Outsiders to the craft use the term 
as an insult though, deriding it as somehow less than more academic pursuits. Regardless of how they are perceived by others, hedge mages devote themselves to the practice with a dedication any tradesman could appreciate.


Whenever you would normally gain a feat or ability score
improvement, you can choose to gain one of the following 
features instead. Y ou can only ever have one such feature:
• Brambleknack. When you enter combat, you can choose to roll initiative with disadvantage. When you do so, 1d4 + 1 leafy hedges spring from the ground in random unoccupied spaces within 20 feet of you. (The GM determines where the hedges appear.) Each hedge occupies a 5-foot square, provides partial cover, and acts as difficult terrain. Each is considered a Medium object with an AC of 10, 10 hit points, immunity to psychic damage, and vulnerability to fire damage. If in suitable conditions, they take permanent root and last until destroyed. Otherwise, they wither and vanish after 1 minute. Y ou can use this feature a number of times per day equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
• Comfrey Fettle. Whenever you consume a potion that uses a die roll to determine its effects, such as one of healing, you can choose to add your proficiency bonus to the roll. Additionally, you can choose to double the duration of any potion, magical plant, or poison you either consume or use.
• Green Thumb. Y ou have a special way with plants, causing wildflowers and herbs to grow with supernatural ease. As a bonus action, you can cause flowers to sprout on the surface or object you touch (though not on creatures). These flowers can spread a number of 5-foot squares equal to your proficiency bonus. Y ou can choose which kind of flower grows, but it must be one that you are familiar with. 
• Hawthorne Curate (5th Level or Higher Required). Y our affinity for soothing remedies and your skill with tinctures, poultices, and herbal concoctions filter into your magic. Y ou gain the ability to cast lesser restoration, protection from poison, and remove curse (as rituals only). Casting these spells requires material components in addition to the somatic and verbal components of the spells. Work with your GM to determine what your unique remedy is for each, but the cost of components for each spell must meet a combined total of at least 100 gp. 
• Mage’s Tools. Y ou can animate one set of artisan’s tools to do what they were designed for. The tools make their own ability check for the task you assign, using your spellcasting modifier + half your proficiency bonus (rounded down). Y ou can use the tools in this way once per long rest, though completing some tasks, such as weaving a tapestry or brewing a potion, may take longer and require repeated attempts. Additionally, whenever you finish a long rest, you may choose one spell that you know from the recommended hedge mage spell list that has a verbal component and cast it once without expending a spell slot.
• Roseskin. When you take piercing damage, you can use your reaction to reduce that damage up to an amount equal to twice your proficiency bonus. When you do so, your skin sprouts sharp, brittle thorns. The next creature to make a successful melee attack against you takes piercing damage equal to the amount that you previously reduced. The thorns persist for an hour or until you are hit by a weapon attack.


CREATURE TRAITS
Y ou can create a themed version of an existing creature by giving it one or more of the following traits or actions:
• Eye-Watering Aroma. Whenever you begin or end your turn within 10 feet of this creature, you must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become blinded as your eyes fill with stinging tears. The DC equals 10 + the creature’s proficiency bonus. The condition ends as soon as you move at least 10 feet away from the creature. T argets with more than two eyes have disadvantage on the saving throw. 
• Rending Thorns. Whenever this creature succeeds on a melee attack by rolling a 19 or 20, your AC is reduced by 1, in addition to suffering the normal effects of the attack. This reduction to AC ends after you take a short or long rest.
• Wreath of Briars. When you hit this creature with a melee attack, it can use its reaction to force you to make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 2d8 piercing damage and dropping whatever you are currently holding on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. The DC equals 10 + the creature’s proficiency bonus.

DEEP MAGIC VOLUME 2PESTILENT MAGIC


Pestilence is an age-old threat to civilizations young
and old. Rumors of plague bear a special kind of terror, carried on the black wings of ravens and the bloody claws of rats. Practitioners of this pestilent magic delve into this primal fear, seeing it as far more than an accidental miasma or wayward curse. At its most evolved, pestilence is an avatar of suffering and corruption, manifesting in the bodies of its victims like a malignant spirit. Some pestilent practitioners would repel disease like a demonic incursion, exorcising pestilent entities or taking them unto themselves, but others welcome it, becoming hosts to terrible afflictions they spread without care.
T raditionally, clerics and paladins form the bulwark of 
casters defending against plagues, but both divine and arcane magic help spread corruption and disease. The line blurs further between these traditions when a caster takes an interest in the tainted potential within the concepts of disease and vermin, whether to combat or embrace them. As such, all spellcasting classes have at least some access to pestilent magic, but clerics and warlocks have the greatest potential in this style.RECOMMENDED SPELL LIST

The list of nonmagical diseases below is not exhaustive
but expands options for diseases to use with the contagion 
spell or similar magical effects, at the GM’s discretion.


The existing disease descriptions that appear in the
contagion spell and elsewhere have been reprinted here for your convenience.


RANDOM DISEASE TABLE

2 Cackle Fever 
3 Filth Fever 
4 Flesh Rot 
5 Mindfire 
6 Rotten Pox (see sidebar)
7 Seizure 
8 Sewer Plague 
9 Sight Rot 
10 Slimy Doom


Blinding Sickness
Pain grips the creature’s mind, and its eyes turn milky white. It has disadvantage on Wisdom checks and Wisdom saving throws and is blinded.


Cackle Fever
This disease targets humanoids, though gnomes are strangely immune. While in the grips of this disease, victims frequently succumb to fits of mad laughter, giving the disease its common name and its morbid nickname: “the shrieks.”
Symptoms manifest 1d4 hours after infection and 
include fever and disorientation. The infected creature gains one level of exhaustion that can’t be removed until the disease is cured.


Any event that causes the infected creature great
stress—including entering combat, taking damage, experiencing fear, or having a nightmare—forces the 
NEW DISEASE: ROTTEN POX
Rotten pox is primarily carried by mice, rats, and other 
small vermin and inflicted through bites. When a humanoid 
is bitten by these vermin or exposed to the open sores 
of a victim of rotten pox, they must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become infected.
It takes 1d6 days for rotten pox to manifest in an infected 
creature. When symptoms begin, the infected creature gains a level of exhaustion from malaise and fever and then 
develops oozing black sores all over their body. Those visibly infected with rotten pox suffer disadvantage on all Charisma 
checks and saving throws and can no longer regain hit 
points except by magical means. Their hit point maximum decreases by 5 (1d10) every 24 hours, and if their hit point 
maximum drops to 0 as a result of this disease, they die.
64
DEEP MAGIC VOLUME 2creature to make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a 
failed save, the creature takes 5 (1d10) psychic damage and becomes incapacitated with mad laughter for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the mad laughter and the incapacitated condition on a success.
Any humanoid creature that starts its turn within 10 
feet of an infected creature in the throes of mad laughter must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or also become infected with the disease. Once a creature succeeds on this save, it is immune to the mad laughter of that particular infected creature for 24 hours.
At the end of each long rest, an infected creature can 
make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the DC for this save and for the save to avoid an attack of mad laughter drops by 1d6.
When the saving throw DC drops to 0, the creature 
recovers from the disease. A creature that fails three of these saving throws gains a randomly determined form of indefinite madness.


Filth Fever
A raging fever sweeps through the creature’s body. It has disadvantage on Strength checks, Strength saving throws, and attack rolls that use Strength.


Flesh Rot
The creature’s flesh decays. It has disadvantage on Charisma checks and vulnerability to all damage.


Mindfire
The creature’s mind becomes feverish. It has disadvantage on Intelligence checks and Intelligence saving throws and behaves as if under the effects of the confusion spell during combat.


Seizure
The creature is overcome with shaking. It has disadvantage on Dexterity checks, Dexterity saving throws, and attack rolls that use Dexterity.At the end of each long rest, an infected creature 
must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the character gains one level of exhaustion. On a successful save, the character’s exhaustion level decreases by one level. If a successful saving throw reduces the infected creature’s level of exhaustion below 1, the creature recovers from the disease.


Sight Rot
This painful infection causes bleeding from the eyes and eventually blinds the victim. A beast or humanoid that drinks water tainted by sight rot must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become infected. One day after infection, the creature’s vision starts to become blurry. The creature takes a −1 penalty to attack rolls and ability checks that rely on sight. At the end of each long rest after the symptoms appear, the penalty worsens by 1. When it reaches −5, the victim is blinded until its sight is restored by magic such as lesser restoration or heal.


Sight rot can be cured using a rare flower called
eyebright, which grows in some swamps. Given an hour, a character who has herbalism kit proficiency can turn the flower into one dose of ointment. Applied to the eyes before a long rest, one dose of it prevents the disease from worsening after that rest. After three doses, the ointment cures the disease entirely.


Slimy Doom
The creature begins to bleed uncontrollably. It has disadvantage on Constitution checks and Constitution saving throws. In addition, whenever it takes damage, it is stunned until the end of its next turn.
MAGIC ITEMS: PLAGUE IMPLEMENTS
This section presents unique items that harness the power of pestilent magic.


Plague Mask of Remedy
Wondrous Item, Uncommon (Requires Attunement)


Usually seen on the grim faces of plague doctors that treat
diseased patients, this mask covers the top half of your face with stiff black leather, and an elongated beak extends out from your nose.
When you don the mask, you smell an assortment of 
pungent, almost-sweet herbs and flowers stuffed into the beak and magically held there and preserved. Y ou have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks requiring scent due to the strength of the remedies, but you gain advantage on your saving throws against attacks based on gases or scents, including stinking cloud and cloudkill.
Once per long rest, you can spend an action to focus on 
breathing in the aromas to soften your fatigue and remove a level of exhaustion.Sewer Plague


Sewer plague is a generic term for a broad category of
illnesses that incubate in sewers, refuse heaps, and stagnant swamps, and which are sometimes transmitted by creatures that dwell in those areas, such as rats and otyughs.


When a humanoid is bitten by a creature that carries the
disease, or when it comes into contact with filth or offal contaminated by the disease, the creature must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or become infected.
It takes 1d4 days for sewer plague’s symptoms to 
manifest in an infected creature. Symptoms include fatigue and cramps. The infected creature suffers one level of exhaustion, and it regains only half the normal number of hit points from spending Hit Dice and no hit points from finishing a long rest.
65
CHAPTER 2 STYLES OF MAGIC


Tail of the West Wind
Weapon (Dagger), Very Rare (Requires Attunement)
Y ou gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made 
with this magic weapon. This dagger has sharp wings encompassing its hilt guard, and the blade curves into a thick edge like a scorpion’s tail.
The dagger has 3 charges. If you attack and hit a diseased 
creature with this dagger, you can choose to inflict no damage and instead expend a charge to absorb the disease into the dagger, curing the target of the disease. Y ou can choose to release one or more diseases stored in the dagger as part of a successful attack, causing an additional 3d8 poison damage for each disease expended. The dagger’s charges are regained on the next dawn after they are expended.


CREATURE TRAITS
Y ou can create a themed version of an existing creature by giving it one or more of the following traits or actions:
• Plague Form. The creature has resistance to necrotic damage and immunity to poison damage.
• Putrid. Whenever the creature takes bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, all creatures within 5 feet of it take 1d6 poison damage.
• Toxic Strike. If the creature hits with a melee attack, the target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. If the target fails the save by 5 or more, the target is also paralyzed while poisoned in this way. The DC equals 10 + the creature’s proficiency bonus.
GRIMOIRE OF PESTILENCE:


CODEX MORTABULA
The waxy yellowed cover of this heavy tome resembles human skin emblazoned with an emerald skull above crossed femurs. A putrescent green ichor drips intermittently from between the vellum pages.


The Codex Mortabula began life as a medical
treatise written by Doctor Claira Mors, outlining her revolutionary hypothesis that many diseases are caused by tiny organisms that invade and attack the body. Scoffing at this heretical idea, the Guild of Physicians and Barber Surgeons stripped the author of her membership and exiled her from the community. Furious at the 
narrow -minded guild, Doctor Mors fell prey to the 
influence of a band of fiends and turned from healing disease to spreading it—for science. She recorded her discoveries in her Codex Mortabula.
Five years to the day after her exile, Doctor Mors 
returned to her former guild and unleashed a wave of disease. Illnesses quickly spread to the city beyond, and in the space of a week, two-thirds of the community perished, including the unwitting Doctor Mors. The Codex 
Mortabula was discovered in the ruins of the guild by a band of healer clerics and taken to their remote temple for study. Unfortunately, the clerics copied the grimoire, as was their custom, and dread enchantment of the original codex infected the copy as well. Precisely how many copies were made of the Codex Mortabula is unclear since clerics of the temple all succumbed to a strange rash of diseases.


Grimoire Adventure Hooks
The grimoire can act as a potent reward for characters or serve as a plot device in adventures. Below are several hooks to utilize it in a campaign: 
• Divine Scourge. Perhaps inspired by its origin, a holy 
sect called the Scourgers of Light has acquired the 
Codex Mortabula with a grim purpose. They use the 
grimoire to spread disease from city to city, claiming to have altered it so that only the wicked and evil will 
succumb to its effects. However, when one of the 
victims is a blameless ally of the characters, they must work to stop the Scourgers. 
• Fever For The Beast. Grimbane the Skulleater, a massive monster with arcane powers, descends from 
the mountains, crushing all who stand in the way. 
No blade or spell can defeat the terrible Skulleater. However, a local adventuring guild has a desperate 
plan, and the characters are hired to find the Codex 
Mortabula and infect Grimbane with enough diseases to end his rampage. 
• Nearest Scapegoat. At some point after the characters acquire the Codex Mortabula, during one of their 
adventures, they learn strange diseases are striking the 
cities and communities they visit. Attacked by vengeful families and pursued by the law, the characters must 
uncover the truth behind the deaths and determine 
who is blaming them for the crimes.
66
DEEP MAGIC VOLUME 2Grimoire of Pestilence: Codex Mortabula
Wondrous Item, Fabled (5th-Level and Higher Properties 
Require Attunement by a Spellcaster)


This grimoire contains horribly illustrated pages detailing
all manner of diseases. The strange ichor occasionally dripping from the tome is a spiritual reflection of the grim information lurking within. The owner of the Codex Mortabula gradually gains a sallow, pallid, or jaundiced complexion. Some who have carried the tome have become obsessed with cleanliness and preventing illness while others delight in spreading contagion. 
If attuned to it, you can use the grimoire as a 
spellcasting focus, and it functions as a spellbook for you. The spells listed below count as spells for your spellcasting class. Moreover, you are immune to disease and have advantage on Intelligence and Wisdom checks made to recall information about or treat diseases.
When found, the book contains the following spells. 
Spells marked with an asterisk (*) appear in Chapter 5:

your level increases, you gain the following benefits while 
the grimoire is on your person. 
5th level. As a reaction when you deal poison or 
necrotic damage, you can give the target a disease. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be infected by your choice of disease from the list below for 1 minute. A creature can only be under the effect of one such disease at a time.
At the beginning of each of its turns, a diseased creature 
can repeat the Constitution saving throw, ending the disease on a success. Once a creature has been subjected to this feature or succeeds on a saving throw against it, it is immune to this feature for 24 hours.
Y ou can use the following diseases:
• Bonebreak Fever. The creature takes 2d6 poison damage at the beginning of each of its turns.
• Chalkstones. The creature’s movement speed is reduced by half.
• Shaking Tremors. The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls and Dexterity saving throws.

you can add the options described in the contagion spell to your list of diseases known. 
In addition, you can use the following new diseases:
• Black Spills. If the creature takes any damage, it takes an extra 2d10 damage of the same type at the start of its next turn. If it take damage from more than one source, only the first is copied. 
• Delirious Porting. At the beginning of each of its turns, the creature magically teleports to a random, unoccupied space within 60 feet of its previous position.
• Horrors. The creature hallucinates, believing its allies are horrible monsters, and must attack its nearest ally.
13th level. Y ou are immune to poison. Moreover, when 
an attack or spell subjects you to poison damage, you regain hit points equal to the poison damage.
In addition, you can use the following new diseases:
• Firespouts. At the beginning of each of its turns, the creature uncontrollably spits fire at the nearest creature, using your spell attack modifier, and on a hit, the target takes 2d10 fire damage.
• Jester’s Gasp. The creature is incapacitated with mad laughter. If it takes damage from any source, it gains advantage on its Constitution saving throw to remove this disease.
• Stonelegs. The creature is restrained and begins to turn to stone from the feet upward. If it fails three consecutive Constitution saving throws to end the disease, it is petrified for an hour. 
17th level. 
Y our Constitution score increases to 20. If 
your Constitution score is already 20, your Strength or Dexterity (your choice) increases by 2, to a maximum of 20.
In addition, you can use the following new diseases:
• Beast’s Curse. Also called zoanthropalitis, this disease causes the creature to magically transform into a beast (CR 1/8 or less) of equal size, as if under the effect of a polymorph spell. At the beginning of each of its turns, the target transforms into the beast, and at the end of each of its turns, it transforms back to its normal form. 
• Spellbuncles. The creature’s mouth and limbs erupt in boils. It can’t speak or cast spells with verbal or somatic components. The creature can still hold objects, just not make intricate gestures.
Quirks of the Codex Mortabula.


While attuned to the
grimoire, you occasionally experience the emotions and attitudes of its previous owners, who have left their psychic imprint upon it. While you are not compelled to act on these feelings, you might randomly experience one of the quirks presented in the Quirks of the Codex Mortabula table.

PORTAL MAGIC
Practitioners of portal magic have an obsession with the 
liminal boundaries of reality. At the cusp of one place and another—buoyed by magic and knowledge—they watch. There is no greater feeling than rushing headlong through some conjured doorway, dragging friend and foe along, without regard for the horrors that lurk one step to the dimensional right, knowing just how wide to crack the magical doorway to serve a purpose.


Portal magic is highly complex and centered on the
manipulation of space. It demands incredible precision to be performed safely. Spells of this style link multiple locations, allowing rapid travel across any distance, whether mere feet or entire planes of existence.

VARIANT: LABYRINTH MAGIC
The minotaurs created what they call “labyrinth magic” 
long ago, a result of their fascination with and mastery 
of mazes. Spells of this sort tend to involve elements 
of confusion, dimensional manipulation, and the strengthening of the minotaur’s natural weapons. They 
are rarely taught to outsiders.
Portal magic is known by many names, but labels like 
labyrinth magic refer to a small portion of the larger umbrella that is portal magic. Whenever you see such 
style names in a Kobold Press product, they are merely 
one facet of the portal magic style.

Y our spellbook can contain such information on a number of creatures equal to your proficiency bonus. It costs 500 gp and takes 10 days to add a creature to your book. If a creature’s attitude toward you changes to hostile or indifferent, its location disappears from your spellbook.PLAYER OPTION: MASTER OF DOORS

At your GM’s discretion, whenever you would learn a new spell as a result of leveling up, you may gain one of these features instead (dispel DC equals your spell save DC):
• Locks. Y ou may choose to magically lock any door you step through. The lock lasts for a minute or until you use this feature on another door. This ability does not change the material from which the door is made, nor does it prevent the door from being damaged. 
• Personalized Portal. After stepping through a door, gate, portal, or similar structure, you may magically mark it. The mark lasts for 24 hours and is invisible, except to those with truesight. Y ou may choose to have the mark visible to any number of friendly creatures.
• Unlikely Connection. As an action, you can magically link two doors that are within 100 feet of one another. A creatures that passes through one of these doors emerges instead from the other. The effect lasts for an hour or until a creature passes through one of the doors. Once you use this ability, you cannot use it again until you complete a long rest.

CHAPTER 2 STYLES OF MAGICCREATURE TRAITS


Y ou can create a themed version of an existing creature by
giving it one or more of the following traits or actions:
• Half There. This creature is literally halfway between this plane of existence and another. Attacks against 
it have disadvantage. Successfully grappling the 
creature brings it fully into this plane for the duration, 
removing any benefit to the creature from this feature.
• Infuriating Redirection. Once per round, as a reaction to being targeted by a ranged attack, the creature can open a portal to redirect the attack to another creature within 30 feet.
• Pop Out. At the end of this creature’s turn, if it did not 
move, it can teleport to any unoccupied space within 
20 feet.
GRIMOIRE OF PORTALS: OSTIUM INFINITUM
On initial inspection, few realize the true nature of the 
Ostium Infinitum. Its pages are hidden within a thick, metallic shell sealed by layers of locks, gears, and other mechanisms meant to deter the irresolute. T o open the tome, one must discover how to surpass each barrier and commit the complex process to memory. Only creatures who successfully complete this process can take true ownership of the grimoire, and on achieving this honor, the book instructs the owner to add a new puzzle mechanism to further secure its secrets.
At present, the Ostium Infinitum is sealed by 24 distinct 
mechanisms, which means the book has changed hands at least that number of times. Most recently, the book has fallen into the possession of a curious type of construct known as a locksmith (see T ome of Beasts 2), who liberated it from the human who hired the construct to open it. Since then, the grimoire’s whereabouts have become a closely guarded secret, and other locksmiths regard the search for it as an obsession—even as a holy act.


Grimoire Adventure Hooks
The grimoire can act as a potent reward for characters or serve as a plot device in adventures. Below are several hooks to utilize it in a campaign: 
• Escape Room. An eccentric millionaire on the brink 
of death announces they are holding a contest to 
determine who should inherit their greatest treasure. 
Participating groups are invited to their mansion to learn more, and upon arrival, they find themselves sealed inside by a series of mundane and magical 
obstacles. If the party can solve all the puzzles required 
to escape the mansion, the millionaire will award them 
with the Ostium Infinitum.
• Future Proof. The character’s travels are suddenly interrupted when a goblin in a black leather duster suddenly steps from a portal directly in their path.


The goblin tosses them the Ostium Infinitum and says
they must deliver it as quickly as they can to the most influential, good-aligned magical institution in your 
campaign setting. The goblin warns the party to defend the book with their lives, or reality itself could be destroyed, and then the goblin promptly disappears through another portal. As long as the book remains in the party’s possession, they are attacked by bands of ever more powerful fiends trying to steal the book.
• Hero Unchained. Upon finally defeating a powerful villain, a local hero was banished and locked in an interdimensional prison cell—courtesy of the villain’s final vengeful act. The people of the land are devastated and eager to reward other adventurers who can safely return their imprisoned hero. However, with the villain now dead, the only thing that can free the hero is the magic of the Ostium Infinitum, which is held within a subterranean vault filled with clockwork monsters and deadly traps.
Grimoire of Portals: Ostium Infinitum
Wondrous Item, Fabled (5th-Level and Higher Properties 
Require Attunement by a Spellcaster)
The Ostium Infinitum is a dissertation on the nature of space, filled with arcane calculations necessary for navigating it via magical means. Those tenacious enough to master the locks that protect the grimoire’s contents are rewarded with revolutionary insight into the mechanical forces that govern the universe and practical guidance for manipulating those forces in accordance with your will.
While holding the book, you can use it as a spellcasting 
focus for your spells and it functions as a spellbook for you. Additionally, you have advantage on any checks made to open locks or other closure mechanisms of magical or mundane make.
When found, the book contains the following spells. 
Spells marked with an asterisk (*) appear in Chapter 5:

Ostium Infinitum (Requires Attunement). As your 
level increases, you gain the following benefits while the 
grimoire is on your person. 
5th level. Whenever you take damage, you can use 
your reaction to teleport to an unoccupied space within 30 feet. Moving in this way does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Y ou can use this feature a number of times per long rest equal to your proficiency bonus.
9th level. As a bonus action, you can use the Ostium 
Infinitum to create a portal. Choose two points you can see within 60 feet of you: an invisible and intangible gateway appears at each point. A Large or smaller creature who steps on a space with a gate can choose to remain in the 
70
DEEP MAGIC VOLUME 2same space or use their movement to step onto any of the 
squares adjacent to the other gate. Stepping through a gate does not provoke attacks of opportunity. The portals remain open for 1 minute or until you choose to close them (no action required). Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you complete a short or long rest.
13th level. Y our speed increases by 10 feet, and you can 
no longer be moved against your will. Attempts to shove or push you automatically fail. Spells or magical effects, like banishment or maze, that would force you out of the Material Plane have no effect on you unless you wish it.
17th level. As an action, you can command the Ostium 
Infinitum to teleport you anywhere in the multiverse. The destination must be known to you—a place you have personally visited or thoroughly studied—and it must be a place that physically exists, though it can be located on any plane of existence. If the destination you select does not meet these conditions, the attempt fails. Once this feature is used, you can’t use it again until you complete a long rest.Quirks of the Ostium Infinitum. While attuned to the 
grimoire, you occasionally experience the emotions and attitudes of its previous owners, who have left their psychic imprint upon it. While you are not compelled to act on these feelings, you might randomly experience one of the quirks presented in the Quirks of the Ostium Infinitum table.


PYROMANCY MAGIC
For practitioners of pyromancy, flame is everything. They weave it like threads through the dry branches of a tree, summon gouts of it from the ground, and bathe in its calming heat. Their allies have known its gentle, life-giving dance, and their enemies have felt its searing kiss.


Pyromancy harnesses one branch of elemental magic
and incorporates some of the oldest and most universally studied spells. Since the dawn of civilization, creatures have relied on fire to survive, seeking mastery over it to warm their bodies, fill their bellies, and light their forges. So too have creatures historically suffered in the wake of 
fire’s awesome destructive power as cities have burned and lives have been claimed by the embers of war. Pyromancers understand—more than anyone—that raw elemental forces like fire are neither good nor evil. Such forces can be called upon to create a staggering array of effects, as long as the caster who wields them has the foresight and the strength necessary to hold them in balance.

DEEP MAGIC VOLUME 2PLAYER OPTION: EMBERS


Spellcasters who devote themselves to pyromancy
sometimes refer to themselves as embers. Those who 
self-identify as ember pyromancers find themselves 
a part of a long line of fire-weaving practitioners who 
seek a connection with the Elemental Plane of Fire. As these spellcasters grow in power, their connection to the plane increases, and their physical form begins to exhibit 
characteristics of their favored element.


Whenever you would normally gain a feat or ability
score improvement, you can choose to gain one of the 
following features instead. Y ou can only ever have one such feature:
• Breath to Smoke. Y ou breathe out thick black smoke. 
As an action, you can create a cloud of smoke centered 
on you that fills the 5-foot cube you currently occupy. 
The cloud moves with you. On subsequent rounds, you 
must use your bonus action to maintain the cloud, or it will dissipate at the end of your turn. Creatures outside the smoke have disadvantage on attacks targeting anything inside the cloud. 
• Fire Rider. As an action, you cause one Huge or larger mount or vehicle you can see to be surrounded by an aura of flames for up to 1 hour. While the flames are active, the target emits bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. The flames are heatless, harmless, and can be ended by you at any time (no action required). While the flames are active, you can use a bonus action to expend a spell slot of 3rd-level or lower, increasing the target’s speed by 10 feet per level of the expended slot. 
• Flame’s Succor. Whenever you take a single instance of fire damage, you can use your reaction to reduce that damage up to an amount equal to twice your proficiency bonus. When you do so, you also recover hit points equal to the amount of damage prevented. 
• Spreader. Y our flesh, scales, or feathers take on an orange-red hue. Whenever a creature within 5 feet of you takes fire damage, you can use your reaction to cause a different creature within 5 feet of you to take damage equal to half the triggering damage amount. 
Once you use this ability, you cannot use it again until 
you complete a short or long rest.
• Upon the Rising Plume. Y ou may use your spellcasting 
ability instead of Strength when determining your long jump and high jump distances. Additionally, you may use a bonfire (or other flame source that takes up 
at least a 5-foot square area) as a magical springboard.


If your movement causes you to pass through or
start your turn in a space with such a fire, you gain a flying speed of 30 feet until the end of your next turn. Y ou still take any damage you would normally from 
entering a fire’s space in this way.• Voice Inferno. Y ou can transform your voice to sound 
like a roaring inferno. Y ou gain the ability to speak and understand Ignan, and you have advantage on Charisma checks made to influence elementals or other creatures from the elemental planes. Additionally, whenever you complete a long rest, you can choose one spell that you know from the recommended pyromancy spell list that has a verbal component, and you can cast this spell once without expending a spell slot.


CREATURE TRAITS
Y ou can create a themed version of an existing creature by giving it one or more of the following traits or actions:
• Evaporating Aura. Whenever you enter an area within 20 feet of this creature for the first time in a turn, or start your turn there, any water, wine, spirits, or other nonmagical fluids you carry evaporate and disappear.
• Hot as Hells. Whenever you enter an area within 5 feet 
of this creature for the first time in a turn, or start your turn there, you must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take fire damage equal to 1d6 + the creature’s proficiency bonus. The DC equals 10 + the creature’s proficiency bonus.
• Singeing Blow. Whenever this creature hits with a melee attack, it deals extra fire damage equal to its proficiency bonus.
IGNICES: CHRONICLE OF FLAME
Over the ages, the Ignices has taken several forms: a staff covered in pictographs, a set of paintings on canvas, and a fabled grimoire. The chronicle of flame has passed from owner to owner as well, its power growing with each. Most recently, it came into the possession of a humble glassworker named Een Jelwud.


Een found the Ignices in the fire-wrecked tower of a
forgotten wizard’s order. Drawn to the buried ruins—by portents seen in molten glass as he worked—Een disappeared into the ashen darkness for several years. In the ruins, the glassworker studied pyromancy. He emerged, returning to his village having grown into a capable spellcaster. Finding no place in his former home, the glassblower, now a mage, established a tower he named the Shard. There, he melds his glassworking craft with the dangers and wonders of the Ignices. 
Once a year, Een hosts a festival to celebrate the heat 
of summer. For seven days, the Shard is surrounded by a series of tents, shops, and pavilions. Celebrants gather nightly at great fires where they dance and drink and toast the power of the flame. Many buy Een’s glassworks during this festival: the small glass baubles and cups are enchanted as minor magic items of various sorts and can be purchased for 25 gp each. At the end of the festival, Een summons a mighty firestorm to incinerate any offerings the participants wish to make.
73
CHAPTER 2 STYLES OF MAGIC
Een is a slender man in his late forties. He wears soot-
covered robes and a heavy leather apron. His hands smoke 
slightly at all times, and his wispy, greying hair floats upward from his scalp when not contained by a hood. He keeps the Ignices in a simple leather satchel that hangs about his shoulders. 
Een has no diabolical ambitions, but he is driven to 
witness and record important fires in his lifetime. None can say if his involvement in the fires is more active, though some rulers regard the glassblower with suspicion.


Grimoire Adventure Hooks
The grimoire can act as a potent reward for characters or serve as a plot device in adventures. Below are several hooks to utilize it in a campaign: 
• Arson. A rash of unexplainable fires affects a major town or city in your campaign. In addition to the loss of property and life, the city’s people grow fearful, threatening to end trade and livelihoods. Strange tales of a living fire teleporting from place to place circulate in the taverns and inns. The characters are hired by the mayor or ruling council to investigate the arsons. They learn that an apprentice wizard, angry at being ejected by a local college, stole the Ignices and is causing the fires as an act of revenge. After recovering the fabled grimoire, the party must choose to keep or return it to its rightful owners. 
• Dragon’s Prize. T ossed into a city’s infamous prison pits for theft, a young wizard has managed to smuggle one of her stolen objects with her: the Ignices. In those dark prison tunnels below the city, she has used the tome’s power to part the veil between the material world and the swirling chaos of the elemental planes. Dangerous prisoners, fiery monsters, and the empowered spellcaster rise from the pits, threatening to immolate the will and wealth of the city’s citizenry.• Dry Grounds. Explorers of an ancient jungle return to a portside community, telling tales of a desert growing nearby. The characters investigate and discover that a miles-wide area of verdant jungle has turned to sand and ash. At the center of the area is a smoldering 
temple where the Ignices, once secured in a magical urn, has tumbled free. Fire-based monsters are drawn to the area. T o prevent the spread of the grimoire’s influence, the party must delve into the temple and return the book to its container or risk taking it themselves.


Ignices
Wondrous Item, Fabled (5th-Level and Higher Properties 
Require Attunement by a Spellcaster)
The Ignices is a grimoire recounting the greatest fires in history. From cataclysmic firestorms caused by meteorites to the humble embers under the most powerful witch’s cauldron, the Ignices lists the world’s most impactful conflagrations. The bearer of this fabled magical object is filled with knowledge on this topic and is driven to seek out fires of great power and importance on behalf of the tome.
While holding the grimoire, you can use it as a 
spellcasting focus for your spells, and it functions as a spellbook for you. You have advantage on Intelligence checks made to interact with or recall information concerning creatures from the elemental planes. 
When found, the book contains the following spells. 
Spells marked with an asterisk (*) appear in Chapter 5:

a creature takes fire damage from a spell you cast, that creature takes additional fire damage equal to your proficiency bonus. 
9th level. Y ou learn three 1st-level spells that are not 
on your spell list. Additionally, you can ignore the effects on your vision (lightly or heavily obscured) from smoke created by mundane and magical fires.
13th level. Once per long rest, when you cast fireball, you 
can choose to have it heal creatures in the affected area instead of damaging them.
17th level. Y ou are immune to fire damage. Once per 
long rest, you can cast one of the spells contained in the Ignices as a bonus action.
74
DEEP MAGIC VOLUME 2Quirks of the Ignices. While attuned to the grimoire, 
you occasionally experience the emotions and attitudes 
of its previous owners, who have left their psychic imprint upon it. While you are not compelled to act on these feelings, you might randomly experience one of the quirks presented in the Quirks of the Ignices table.

5 Y ou dislike being wet and avoid rain, baths, and 
boats whenever possible.
6 Food and water that you carry for more than an

7 Y ou like to set fires.
8 Y our face is perpetually coated in a thin layer of soot that does not wash off.RITUAL MAGIC


Practitioners of ritual magic know better than most that
a prepared mage is the deadliest kind of mage. This is magic that requires a mind for strategy, patience, and resourcefulness—qualities beyond the reach of crude boom-and-blast casters. Ritualists perceive spellcasting like a puzzle: a clever hand brings all the pieces into place to unlock a vision that shakes the cosmos.


Ritual magic is the most complex form of spellcasting
and the style with the greatest potential to alter the world on a grand scale. Spells of this style take longer to cast and consequently create long-lasting effects that are hard to reverse—if not impossible.
VARIANT: ELVEN RITUAL MAGIC
There are many variations of ritual magic that fall under the broader ritual style, but one of the most well-known branches is called elven ritual magic.
When the elves first developed their magic long ago, the 
spells they used were all cast as rituals. Over time, mages discovered how to cast most spells more quickly and with greater potency—at the expense of sapping their energy, which they had to recuperate to cast again.

75
CHAPTER 2 STYLES OF MAGICSome of the original elven rituals are still being taught 
and used today, and just as in the distant past, they can be 
cast only as rituals. That aspect of their nature sets them apart from all other spells because it means that anyone who can cast one of these spells can do so repeatedly, without needing to draw on enough of their inner power to deplete their magical ability.
Ritual Focus. Another quality unique to elven ritual 
magic is the ability of the caster to call upon inner reserves and expend extra effort to improve or enhance the effect. This extra effort is represented by the caster’s ritual focus. Each of these spells ends with a paragraph that explains an additional effect of the spell that can be achieved by expending a ritual focus during the casting of that spell.
Unlike a normal spellcasting focus, a ritual focus is not 
an object but a state of mind. And once this mental energy has been expended, a caster’s ritual focus can’t be used again until they finish a short or long rest.

PLAYER OPTION: RITUALS EXPANDED


This section offers alternatives to the way characters can
learn ritual spells. Before using one of these options, make sure to get approval from your GM.
Class Feature: Rituals Known
Prerequisite: Bard, Cleric, Druid, or Wizard; Must Be T aken at 1st-Level; Replaces the Ritual Casting Component of the Spellcasting Feature


Y ou have access to a special type of long-form spell called
a ritual. Y ou do not need to prepare ritual spells to cast them, and they do not expend a spell slot when cast.
At 1st level, choose one ritual of your choice from your 
class spell list. Y ou learn additional rituals of your choice at higher levels. Each time you gain access to a new level 
of spell slots by gaining a level in your spellcasting class, you learn one new ritual spell. This new ritual must be from your class spell list, and it must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, when a bard reaches 5th level, they gain access to 3rd-level spells, so the bard would learn one ritual spell of 3rd level or lower.
76
DEEP MAGIC VOLUME 2Rituals you learn in this way do not count against the 
number of spells you learn at each level, but ritual spells 
you learn in this way can’t be cast as normal spells—even if the spell description would typically allow you to choose whether a spell can be cast as a normal spell or a ritual spell.
New Feat: Ritualist
Prerequisite: Spellcasting Class Feature


Y our study of magic has unlocked the mysteries of ritual
spells. When you gain this feat, you also gain a ritual book, which contains the rituals you know. T o cast a ritual spell, you must have your ritual book in hand.
Choose one of the following spellcasting classes: bard, 
cleric, druid, witch, or wizard. You must choose your 
rituals from that class’s spell list. Regardless of which list you choose, you use your normal spellcasting ability for 
these spells.
When you first gain your ritual book, you add one ritual 
of each spell level you have already unlocked via your 
spellcasting class. For example, a bard that selects this feat at 4th level has spell slots for 1st level and 2nd level, so they would add one 1st-level ritual and one 2nd-level ritual to their book.


Each time you gain access to a new level of spell slots by
gaining a level in your spellcasting class, you add one new ritual spell to your book. This new ritual must be from the same spell list you originally chose, and it must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, when a bard reaches 5th level, they gain access to 3rd-level spells, so the bard would select one ritual spell of 3rd level or lower to add to their ritual book.


Rituals you learn in this way do not count against the
number of spells you learn at each level, but ritual spells you learn in this way can’t be cast as normal spells—even if the spell description would typically allow you to choose whether a spell can be cast as a normal spell or a ritual spell.CREATURE TRAITS
Y ou can create a themed version of an existing creature by giving it one or more of the following traits or actions:
• Ritualist. This creature knows three ritual spells of your choice. These spells can be from any spell list, 
but they can’t be of a level that exceeds this creature’s 
proficiency bonus. The creature can cast each of these 
spells once per long rest without expending material 
components. If a ritual requires a saving throw, the DC 
equals 10 + this creature’s proficiency bonus.
• Superior Focus. This creature has advantage on 
Constitution saving throws to maintain concentration.


SAINT MAGIC
Practitioners of saint magic embrace the truth that 
divinity shines in manifold forms. Divine magic need not come directly from the gods; it can flow from the hearts of the faithful when the need is great.


Saint magic is one aspect of divine magic that focuses
on serving the needs of allies and communities—often at the expense of those who wield it. T o use saint magic is to discard selfish need and follow the example of those who have sacrificed themselves in pursuit of the greater good. Spells of this style amplify specific aspects of faith, enhancing virtues like devotion or a user’s ability to dish out righteous judgement.

RITUAL FOCUS SPELL OR NOT?


Elven ritual spells can be incorporated into the game in
one of two ways, depending mainly on whether the GM 
uses the rules for feats. If so, then it might be necessary 
for a character to have the Ritualist feat (see Player Option: Rituals Expanded) before the ritual focus bonus of these 
spells can be employed. If not, then—unless the GM 
decides otherwise—a character can cast any of these spells 
as normal, provided that they appear on their spell list.

Y ou can create a themed version of an existing creature by giving it one or more of the following traits or actions:
• Blessing of Vitality. The creature regenerates 10 hit points at the start of its turn. If the creature takes necrotic damage, this trait doesn’t function at the start of the creature’s next turn. The creature dies only if it starts its turn with 0 hit points and doesn’t regenerate.
• Divine Protection. If you target the creature with an attack or a harmful spell, you must first make a Wisdom saving throw (DC equals 10 + this creature’s proficiency bonus). On a success, you attack as normal, and you are immune to this feature for 1 minute. On a failed save, you must choose a new target or lose the attack or spell. If the creature attacks another creature, that target is immune to this feature for 1 minute.
• Heavenly Wrath. Whenever this creature makes a successful weapon attack, they deal an additional 1d8 radiant damage.

DEEP MAGIC VOLUME 2
GRIMOIRE OF SAINT OVILA:


AN ACCOUNTABILITY OF HONOR
This gilded tome is emblazoned with celestial iconography 
crafted from golden threads, gems, and bands of silver.


The shape of a dove formed from sparkling gemstones is
set into the cover.
Long ago, the barbarian warlord Ovila Fleshscraper 
descended from the northern steppes to lay waste to cities 
and towns with an army of dark warriors and monstrous allies. Known for excoriating her victims, Ovila knew no 
equal in her savagery and made many offerings of flesh 
and souls to her dark gods. Even today, the legend of her 
evils endures in children’s rhymes:
Close the hatch, hide in the thatch, hush now and pray. Hear 
the drums? The Scraper comes to scrape your flesh away. 
Y ears into her bloody advance, while battling an 
alliance of humans, dwarves, and elves in a mountain valley, Ovila faced a human knight in single combat. His name was Sir Morien, and only that morning had he been dubbed a knight. Y et he embodied all the virtues imparted to him by his paladin instructors, and a heart of honor burned in his chest. 
For hours, her notched battleaxe met his shining sword. 
As they fought, Ovila insulted the knight, but Morien met every barb with lessons on chivalry, honor, and kindness. Despite her savagery and the dark powers given by her grim deities, Ovila could not pierce Morien’s defenses. Y et where no blade could find purchase, his words found gaps in her armor. At length, both exhausted themselves and paused for a breath. At that moment, a troop of alliance archers treacherously fired at Ovila, and Morien leapt in front, taking the shots in his own chest. When she asked him why, the dying Sir Morien answered, “Even the life of a foe is worth protecting,” and then he died. 
Humbled by the knight’s sacrifice, Ovila abandoned 
her army and her dark gods, fleeing into the wilderness for a decade. In the wastes, she repented and was filled with a holy light. When she again appeared in the civilized nations, she carried with her a tome filled with all of the lessons Morien kindled in her. Ovila healed the sick, performed miracles, and brought justice to the wicked. Eventually, she was martyred in a confrontation with an avatar of her former dark gods. Her book was enshrined as a reliquary for a time but was lost in some forgotten raid.


Grimoire Adventure Hooks
The grimoire can act as a potent reward for characters or serve as a plot device in adventures. Below are several hooks to utilize it in a campaign: 
• Dark Shadow. The shade of Saint Ovila’s former evil endures. The Fleshscraper spirit appears in nightmares or moments of moral weakness and seeks to corrupt anyone who possesses the tome. Further, when it appears, the spirit commits vicious murders involving the rending of flesh. The crimes all lead back to the owner of the grimoire. 
• Honor a Saint. Shortly after acquiring the grimoire, a vision of Saint Ovila appears before the new owner. She pledges celestial rewards and the blessings of the gods of light if the owner proves themselves by embodying each of the virtues described in the tome. 
• Jealous Order. The Golden Blades, an order of paladins devoted to the memory of Sir Morien, hunts for the grimoire. They see the tome as a stain on the honor of their brotherhood and believe it must be destroyed. The only way to dissuade them is to recover the missing sword of Sir Morien, long ago lost to a demon-filled lair in the mountains.
Grimoire of Saint Ovila: An Accountability of Honor
Wondrous Item, Fabled (5th-Level and Higher Properties 
Require Attunement by a Spellcaster)
This book contains axioms about the twelve virtues of honor, along with handwritten notes discussing each entry. Though there only appear to be two dozen or so pages, the tome actually has an infinite number. The owner of Accountability of Honor gradually becomes very reluctant to lie, intolerant of lies told by others, and they behave under a strict moral code. 
If attuned to it, you can use the grimoire as a 
spellcasting focus, and it functions as a spellbook for you. The spells listed below count as spells for your spellcasting class. Moreover, while this tome is in your possession, you have proficiency in Wisdom (Insight), and when you hold it, you have advantage on skill checks to detect lies. 
Paladins. Accountability of Honor holds great affinity for 
holy warriors. If you have at least two levels of paladin and you attune to this tome, you gain an additional use of your Divine Smite feature. This single use functions as a 1st-level spell slot but does not expend one of your actual spell slots. Y ou regain any expended uses of this benefit when you finish a long rest.

SHADOW MAGIC
Darkness brings a tingle to the spine, fear building at the 
threat of the unknown. When the light goes out, the hair on the back of the neck stands up. Was it the wind, or is something lurking just out of sight, waiting to attack? Those that stalk the night are built for the darkness, sensing what others can’t and using it to advantage.


Shadow magic can lend a sinister feel to an NPC or cast
a player character as a cursed hero who uses the power of darkness for good—at the cost of their soul. Spellcasters who manipulate shadow draw this mysterious, unsettling energy from alien dimensions and turn it to their own uses.

CREATURE TRAITS
Y ou can create a themed version of an existing creature by 
giving it one or more of the following traits or actions:
• Dancing Shadows. While standing in dim light or darkness, the creature can use their bonus action to teleport to a different unoccupied space of dim light or darkness it can see within 30 feet.
• Shadow Cloak. Whenever the creature takes damage, it can use its reaction to create a 10-foot-radius sphere of magical darkness centered on itself. The darkness remains until dispelled or until the beginning of the creature’s next turn. The creature can use this feature a number of times equal to its proficiency bonus.
• Shadow Sight. The creature has darkvision out to a range of 60 feet (if they don’t already have darkvision) and can see in magical darkness out to the same distance.
GRIMOIRE OF SHADOW: ARS UMBRA
The charcoal leather cover of this strange grimoire is undecorated but for a vertical row of glowing azure outlines representing the phases of the moon. The tome feels oddly lighter than it should, and its pages’ edges appear to fade into whisps of tattered darkness.
Some time ago, the dwarven scholar Ithil Hythrim 
constructed a magnificent observatory on a high mountain. Where most of her kin’s focus was below ground, Ithil yearned to study the night sky and all it contained. Her passion and obsession were so great that she pledged herself to the moon, trading her soul in exchange for secret knowledge of lunar light and deep shadow. Over the course of her long life, she recorded her findings in a journal she called the Ars Umbra, a grimoire imbued with some manner of power from her patron. 
Long after Hythrim’s death, the Ars Umbra came into 
the possession of Iban Salas, an arcane thief of middling reputation. Using the grimoire, Salas rose in the ranks of his thieves’ guild, dispatching foes and accomplishing heists with equal ruthlessness, and now he stands as the youngest guildmaster in its history. The grimoire is locked in a secure vault beneath Salas’s extensive mansion. T oday, he ingratiates himself in the hearts and minds of the city’s wealthy and poor alike. Each season, he hosts the Nightgames, a series of grand tournaments, revelries, and feasts held all night long. However, the gift of the moon is not meant to be hidden away, so it will not be long before the Ars Umbra surfaces once again.


Grimoire Adventure Hooks
The grimoire can act as a potent reward for characters or serve as a plot device in adventures. Below are several hooks to utilize it in a campaign: 
• Lost Dance. A dying elf lord’s only wish is to see a specific ritual dance in veneration of the moon before he passes. Unfortunately, the only place the specifics of this dance can be found is within the pages of the Ars Umbra. Thus the characters are hired to venture into a valley cast into perpetual darkness. The grimoire is guarded by various shadow-loving monsters under the command of a demon of shade and sorrow.
• Reclaiming the Light. An order of paladins called Lunara’s Shield believe that the Ars Umbra contains power stolen from their moon goddess and that those who so much as possess it tarnish her divinity. When a wounded mage falls dead in the road in front of the characters, they find his arms wrapped around the Ars Umbra. They are attacked by the paladins, and no manner of diplomacy is enough to dissuade them. The characters must defend themselves against the attention of Lunara’s Shield while venturing to a lost temple where they can appeal to the moon goddess herself. 
• To the Moon. A nobleman’s daughter, Misha, has mysteriously gone missing from her chambers, leaving only broken furniture, signs of a magical portal, and the Ars Umbra. Hired to find her, the characters quickly discover a bookmark in the grimoire noting a ceremony to open a portal to the moon. Replicating this ritual, the characters journey to the moon where Misha is imprisoned by a forgotten race of humanoids and guarded by planar monstrosities.

DEEP MAGIC VOLUME 2Grimoire of Shadow: Ars Umbra
Wondrous Item, Fabled (5th-Level and Higher Properties 
Require Attunement by a Spellcaster)


The glowing outline of the phases of the moon on the
cover of Ars Umbra are formed from incredibly small crystal mosaics inlaid in the leather. Opening the cover reveals the pages of a beautifully calligraphed lunar calendar, charting the cycle of the phases of the moon (or moons) in great detail along with other relevant astronomical notations. The enchantments in the grimoire adjust the text to reflect the lunar cycle for the current plane or planet. The owner of Ars Umbra gradually comes to venerate the moon as a deity and begins to prefer darkness and shadow rather than direct sunlight. Some owners even become nocturnal. 
If attuned to it, you can use the grimoire as a spellcasting 
focus, and it functions as a spellbook for you. The spells listed below count as spells for your spellcasting class. Moreover, you have darkvision to a range of 60 feet, or if you already have darkvision, its range increases by 30 feet.
When found, the book’s pages contain the following 
spells. Spells marked with an asterisk (*) appear in Chapter 5:
1st level: cloak of shadow*, lunarbolt waxing*2nd level: clinging shadow*, darkbolt*3rd level: obviating shadow*, shadow tendrils*4th level: shadow monsters*5th level: shadow passenger*6th level: stygian eye*7th level: dying of the light*8th level: creeping darkness*9th level: umbral storm*
A Shadowed Circumgyration (Requires Attunement). 
As your level increases, you gain the following benefits 
while the grimoire is on your person. Saving throws for its features equal your spellcasting DC.
5th level. As an action, you can speak the command 
word and cause the dark moon sigil to rise from the tome’s cover and transform into a two-inch-diameter stone sphere. This moon orbits your head at a distance of 1d3 feet for 1 hour. The moon moves with you and does not interfere with your actions. Once you summon forth the dark moon, you must finish a short or long rest before you can summon it again.
While your dark moon orbits your head, you can use the 
following features:
• Darkbeam. Y ou can use a bonus action to cause the dark moon to emit a beam of pure shadow at one creature or object within 60 feet of you. When you do so, make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the target takes 1d6 necrotic damage plus your proficiency bonus. The damage from your darkbeam increases by 1d6 when you reach 9th level (2d6), 13th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).• Eclipsed Form. Y ou have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to use the Hide action.
9th level. When you now speak the command word, 
the waning crescent sigil also rises from the tome’s cover and transforms into a second two-inch-diameter stone sphere. This second moon functions identically to the dark moon and allows you to use the following features:
• Hungry Moon.  As a reaction when you take necrotic 
or radiant damage, you can absorb some of the energy. You gain resistance to the triggering damage type until the start of your next turn. In addition, when you hit with an attack for the first time on your next turn, the target takes an extra 1d12 damage of the triggering type.
• Tenebrous Aura. Y ou gain resistance to necrotic damage.
13th level. When you now speak the command word, 
the waxing gibbous sigil also rises from the tome’s cover and transforms into a third two-inch-diameter stone sphere. This third moon functions identically to the dark moon and allows you to use the following features:
• Gloaming Glide. Y our feet no longer touch the ground. Instead, a thin layer of shadow cushions your steps and allows you to glide an inch above the flat surface of any solid ground or liquid. While you are within 1 inch of any appropriate surface, you move and act as if you were standing on solid ground. Y ou also no longer trigger traps that rely on weight or touch. When you take the Dash action, you can move vertically as part of your movement.
• Voidfield. As an action, your waxing gibbous moon creates a circular shadow in a number of 5-foot cubes equal to your proficiency bonus in unoccupied spaces you can see within 120 feet. The shadow cubes last for 1 minute. During this time, when you stand in one of these areas, you can use your bonus action to teleport to any other of the shadow cubes. Once you use this feature, it does not function again until you next summon the moons from the cover of the grimoire.
17th level. When you now speak the command word, 
the full moon sigil also rises from the tome’s cover and transforms into a fourth two-inch-diameter stone sphere. This fourth moon functions identically to the dark moon and allows you to use the following feature:
• Detonating Shadows. As an action, you can choose a number of creatures you can see within 90 feet to make Dexterity saving throws as their shadows wrap around them and explode. On a failed save, a creature takes 10d6 necrotic damage, 10d6 radiant damage, and 5d6 fire damage, and on a successful one, a creature takes half as much damage. Once you use this feature, it does not function again until you next summon the moons from the cover of the grimoire.

Practitioners of spirit magic enact their spells by working
with the forces beyond the known world. These forces are generally known as spirits, though there is incredible diversity in the kinds of spirits throughout the multiverse. While individuals can be born with the sensitivities required to look beyond the veil, these mages gain their power by building and strengthening relationships with spirits. Casting spirit magic is always a negotiation between yourself and the beings that dwell beyond.

PLAYER OPTION: SPIRIT VESSEL
Most beings born with inherent sensitivities to the spirit world live perfectly normal lives, unhampered by their minor flashes of intuition or awareness. Such individuals often excuse their subconscious awareness as the product of an overactive imagination and grow out of their gifts as they age. Others recognize such stirrings for what they truly are and willingly develop their natural gifts into a full-blown talent for connecting with spirits. Some individuals never have a choice whether to embrace the spirit world, due to circumstances that leave them vulnerable to connection, possession, or other supernatural interactions.


Possession
When the veil between realities is parted—or torn open—spirits can cross from the world of the ethereal into 
physical form by occupying the bodies of suitable creatures or objects. Unwilling hosts (or vessels) possessed by a spirit 
might be dominated by the spirit, becoming prisoners within their own mind as the possessor takes complete control of their host body. An unwilling host might also be forced to share their consciousness, locked in a constant struggle for control with the possessing spirit. Cunning spirits might hide inside an unwilling vessel without the creature’s knowledge, subtly influencing the host or waiting to assert control only when the time is right. Creatures born with sensitivities to the spirit world are typically more vulnerable to this type of forced possession than those born without supernatural awareness, but unusual circumstances can make any creature vulnerable to hostile spirits
.


Symbiosis
Becoming a spirit vessel does not always have to be a violent or traumatic process. Those who study spirit magic forge bonds with all manner of spirits, both malicious and benevolent. Such practitioners can learn to willingly invite spirits to share their bodies, creating a mutually beneficial situation between spirit and vessel. In a symbiotic relationship, a spirit vessel typically retains control of their body—unless the host invites the spirit 
WHAT ARE SPIRITS?
When talking about spirits in the context of this style, 
we are not referring to typical creatures. Spirits are 
embodiments of ideals and purpose for all things.


Practitioners of spirit magic can reach beyond the physical world and commune directly with the spirits who dwell
within objects, places, and more abstract concepts like 
emotions or eras of time.


There are an infinite number of spirits that embody
specific minutia, but these vast ranks can be sorted into general categories labeled by motivating force. For 
example, an individual spirit might represent “the spirit of 
tears shed by young lovers forced to part ways,” but for the purpose of this style, we might categorize that spirit 
into the more general “spirit of compassion” category.
85
CHAPTER 2 STYLES OF MAGICto take control—and the spirit’s consciousness exists as 
a separate entity inside the host’s mind. Even in the case of coexistence, a spirit vessel inevitably takes on traits of the spirit sharing their body, and as time goes on, the two consciousnesses inevitably begin to meld together into one inseparable being.


Hosting a Spirit
With the GM’s permission, your character can become a spirit vessel, gaining the benefits and quirks of the type of spirit you host. As part of a long rest, you can invite a spirit to share your body. When you do so, choose one of the following types of spirits. Unless otherwise specified by your GM, either you or the spirit can terminate the relationship at any time (no action required), at which point you no longer have access to the benefits or are beholden to the quirks granted by hosting the spirit.

The following list presents the types of spirits you can host as a spirit vessel. Each type of spirit presents a brief description, the benefits of hosting that type of spirit, and suggested quirks you display while hosting the spirit.

whether there is a chance of surviving a fall from a 100-
foot drop. The GM has the final say on the extent of the

CREATURE TRAITS
Y ou can create a themed version of an existing creature by

creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It 
takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an 
object.
• Shapeless. This creature is invisible except to creatures with truesight or under the effects of spells like detect 
magic or see invisibility.
SPIRIT GRIMOIRE:  
MIZZEN’S GUIDE TO THE UNSEEN
The seafoam-green cover of this grimoire emits a soft, 
steady glow. It is decorated with intricate blue geometric patterns, and a portion of it extends beyond the edges 
of the pages, framing an eye-sized, glass lens. Its pages 
contain essays on the nature of spirits, guidelines for 
interacting with the unseen occupants of the multiverse, 
and firsthand accounts of interactions with the curious 
entities that dwell beyond the veil of measurable reality.


Most of these entries are penned by an author named
Mizzen, who provides frustratingly little detail about 
themselves or their own nature. However, those who 
spend time re-reading the book frequently discover 
new essays, pages, and notations that were not present 
upon their last reading. These entries seem to appear 
and disappear randomly and are clearly penned by 
different unidentified authors, all with different styles of 
penmanship. This bizarre property has led several of its

CHAPTER 2 STYLES OF MAGICowners to believe the book itself is possessed or haunted 
by spirits—and to speculate that Mizzen themself may actually be a spirit.
Mizzen’s Guide to the Unseen has changed hands an 
impressive number of times since its appearance on the Material Plane. The grimoire’s powers are invaluable to seers and charlatans alike, which means its owners are frequent targets of theft—or of nastier fates. By all accounts, the guide is currently in the possession of the infamous Oracle of Pythia, but it is unlikely such a prominent celebrity has managed to hold onto the book for any significant length of time.


Grimoire Adventure Hooks
The grimoire can act as a potent reward for characters or serve as a plot device in adventures. Below are several hooks to utilize it in a campaign: 
• Bad Company. After acquiring the grimoire, a local noble’s personality has completely changed, causing them to become a cruel and tyrannical ruler. The noble’s vassals fear their leader is possessed and are desperately seeking someone who can separate the noble from the book.
• Crossover. A group of novice spellcasters need help after using the grimoire to accidentally tear a hole in the fabric of reality. The apprentices managed to seal the rift but not before several powerful spirits crossed over. The characters must use the book to find the renegade spirits and return them to their rightful place before the influence of the material world drives them to become confused and violent.
• Cry for Help. One of the characters becomes the target of a good spirit, trying to get their attention. The spirit uses a series of ever more desperate dreams, messages, and signs to convince them to become a vessel for it (see Player Option: Spirit Vessel above), so they can rescue the grimoire from a nearby abandoned castle filled with evil spirits.Mizzen’s Guide to the Unseen
Wondrous Item, Fabled (5th-Level and Higher Properties 
Require Attunement by a Spellcaster)
Mizzen’s Guide to the Unseen is a study of spirits and other supernatural beings that dwell beyond material reality. The bearer of this fabled grimoire is gifted with heightened perception and armed with knowledge about the invisible forces that govern the cosmos.
While holding the book, you can use it as a spellcasting 
focus for your spells, and it functions as a spellbook for you. Additionally, while the book is on your person, you have advantage on saving throws made to resist becoming charmed or possessed. 
When found, the book contains the following spells.

Whenever you cast a spell like detect magic, 
clairvoyance, or any similar spell that has an ongoing effect on your senses, the duration of that spell’s effect is doubled.
9th level. Once per long rest, you can use an action 
to ask the spirits that dwell within the grimoire a single question. The answer to the question is a one-word answer, such as “yes,” “no,” “maybe,” “never,” “irrelevant,” or “unclear” (if the spirits don’t know the answer to the question). There is a 10-percent chance that the grimoire answers with a lie (and the GM secretly makes this roll each time a question is asked).
13th level. Continued contact with the book has opened 
your mind to the universal language of the cosmos. Y ou understand any language you hear, and creatures can understand anything you say regardless of the language you use, as long as they speak at least one language.
17th level. Y ou can see invisible creatures and objects 
within 30 feet of you that are within line of sight. Y ou can also see into the Ethereal Plane within the same distance.
Quirks of Mizzen’s Guide to the Unseen. While attuned 
to the grimoire, you occasionally experience the emotions and attitudes of its previous owners, who have left their psychic imprint upon it. While you are not compelled to act on these feelings, you might randomly experience one of the quirks presented in the Quirks of Mizzen’s Guide to the Unseen table.

Practitioners of true name magic are dedicated to the
mastery of an ancient art that taps into the power of creation itself. Those who pursue it seek dominion over others by peering into the deepest source of identity and consequently gaining the ability to influence beings both great and small.
Unlike other magic styles, true name magic serves to 
enhance existing spellcasting. Mastering its components allows a caster to focus their power by astounding degrees, tailoring their arcane influence more precisely to those they target.


UTILIZING TRUE NAME MAGIC
T rue name magic is a system that enhances spellcasting, allowing a spellcaster to increase the potency of spells over certain targets. T o use a true name, it must first be learned or “known,” and it must be prepared. Preparing a list of true name parts requires time spent meditating on the words and fixing them in your mind: at least 1 minute per root word, 3 minutes per prefix, and 10 minutes per suffix. Due to their potent nature, the number of true name parts a caster can have fixed in mind at any given time depends on the character’s proficiency bonus.

89
CHAPTER 2 STYLES OF MAGICTrue Name Casting Feat. Utilizing true name casting 
requires the T rue Name Casting feat detailed below. If the 
option to gain feats isn’t used in your campaign, then the ability to use true names can be gained in place of a level-based ability score improvement, at GM’s discretion. Alternatively, a character might need to accomplish other story-related tasks determined by the GM to gain the benefits of the T rue Name Casting feat.


Enhancing Spells
Once your list of true name parts is prepared, you can use any combination of the prepared parts to enhance a number of spells equal to 1 + your proficiency bonus. After you have enhanced that many spells, you must complete a long rest and re-prepare your list before you can use any true name parts again.
T o enhance a spell, you must always use a root word. 
If you use two parts of a true name, you must use a root word and a prefix. If you use three parts of a true name (which is a full true name), you must use a root word, a prefix, and a suffix. Y ou can’t use multiple parts of the same type to enhance a spell.


Verbal Components
Speaking one or more parts of a true name as part of casting a spell counts as the spell’s verbal component. If a spell does not have a verbal component, it can’t be enhanced with any part of a true name.


Learning New Parts of a True Name
A character can know any number of true name parts. However, like most esoteric magic, parts of true names aren’t common knowledge, and they must be found, researched, or learned from a mentor. For players, this could provide incentive for characters to seek out long-forgotten chances of magical knowledge, spend downtime researching true names (see Magical Research Downtime Rules in Chapter 3), or even tracking down a master namer. For GMs, you can reward characters with new parts of a true name as you might reward them with spell scrolls or an enemy’s spellbook, or you can use true name parts as rewards from arcane patrons or allies.
As detailed in the T rue Name Casting feat, a character 
automatically learns a single root word when they embark on their research of true names, but seeking the other root words allows you to create ever more potent combinations to enhance your spells.
Learning Suffixes. Suffixes are the final part of a true 
name, and learning a suffix should involve a significant amount of mechanical and narrative effort. A suffix is incredibly personal and can’t be learned by simply discovering it upon a page or reading it. 
T o learn a suffix, a caster must hear it—intentionally 
given—from the creature who owns it or from a creature who has been intentionally given the name by the original creature. Note that “freely given” simply means a creature can’t be magically coerced to give their true name, but they can certainly be tricked or forced to do so through mundane means. This loophole is what allows creatures like devils and fey to accumulate and broker lists of true names—eventually resulting in dire consequences for the hapless mortals who have no idea what they have traded away.


PARTS OF A TRUE NAME
T rue names are broken down into three parts, and each of these parts carries different levels of influence. A 
practitioner can enhance their spells with just one part of a name, two parts, or three for truly potent magical effects.
Root Word: Aspect
The first part of every true name is comprised of a root word that grants influence over a core aspect of a creature’s being. These root words are the easiest to 
WHAT ARE TRUE NAMES?
When talking about true names in the context of this style, 
we are not referring to the word or set of words by which 
creatures are known, addressed, or referred to. True names 
are mystic notations that describe the fundamental identity 
and nature of a creature, regardless of any language it may 
happen to know or understand. 
As with spells, learning and invoking even part of a true 
name requires a huge amount of effort and energy—much 
more so than the effort it takes to learn or speak a simple 
word. Those who study true name magic must start with 
mastery of the broadly applicable—but less potent—
components of full names, which are often referred to as 
root words. As their personal abilities and knowledge grow, 
practitioners learn to combine these roots with ever more 
specific portions of a name to enhance the effectiveness of 
their spells against the targets they name.


TRUE NAME CASTING FEAT
Prerequisite: Ability to cast at least one spell that requires 
a target to make a saving throw
You have unlocked the basic tenets of true name casting. 
You gain the following benefits:
• You learn one root word of your choice.
• You can meditate on true name words you know and prepare them during a long rest. You can have a number 
of words prepared at one time equal to your proficiency 
bonus. You can use prepared words to enhance spells you cast, as described in the True Name Magic section.

DEEP MAGIC VOLUME 2master but grant the least amount of power because they 
deal with the broadest categories that define a creature’s true name. 
The three root words and their effects are described here.


Body
Root Word
Aspect: Strength, Dexterity Effect: When you enhance a spell that requires your target 
to make a Strength or Dexterity saving throw, you double your proficiency bonus when calculating your spell save DC for that spell.


Heart

Aspect: Constitution, Charisma Effect: When you enhance a spell that requires your target 
to make a Constitution or Charisma saving throw, you double your proficiency bonus when calculating your spell save DC for that spell.


Mind
Root Word
Aspect: Intelligence, WisdomEffect: When you enhance a spell that requires your target 
to make an Intelligence or Wisdom saving throw, you double your proficiency bonus when calculating your spell save DC for that spell.
Prefix: Form
The second part of every true name is a prefix that grants influence over the core form that defines a creature’s being. These prefixes are difficult to master but grant a moderate amount of power because they deal with more specific categories that define a creature’s true name.


The true name prefixes and their effects are described
here.


Aberration
Prefix
Form: Creatures of the aberration typeEffect: When you enhance a spell that requires an 
aberration to make a saving throw of a type specified in the root word, the target has disadvantage on the saving throw.

make a saving throw of a type specified in the root word, the target has disadvantage on the saving throw. Celestial

to make a saving throw of a type specified in the root 
word, the target has disadvantage on the saving throw.

to make a saving throw of a type specified in the root word, the target has disadvantage on the saving throw. 
Suffix: Identity
Suffixes are the final and most powerful part of a true name and far more difficult to learn than the others. Unlike root words and prefixes, a suffix is tied to one 
specific creature and consequently is incredibly powerful.


Because there are as many suffixes in the universe as
there are creatures, they can’t possibly be listed here, but a 
template for these parts is listed here.


Identity

Effect: When you enhance a spell that targets a creature of 
the type specified in the prefix to make a saving throw of 
a type specified in the root word, the target automatically 
fails the saving throw.


Creature Traits
Y ou can create a themed version of an existing creature by 
giving it one or more of the following traits or actions:
• Enhanced Spellcasting. Any spells this creature casts 
have their saving throw DC increased by 1.
• Potent Spellcasting (CR 10 or Higher Creature Only).


Creatures have disadvantage on saving throws made to
resist spells cast by this creature.WEATHER MAGIC
Practitioners of weather magic draw on natural forces, 
expressed in the ever-present storms and similar phenomena that comprise the world’s weather. Though civilization continues to lull itself into false security, these spellcasters know that all creatures are helpless in the face of nature’s wrath and could not survive without the gifts it bestows.


Weather magic does not concern itself with creating
new things, but instead, it centers on manipulating the forces already present in the environment. By reading subtle patterns in the air and earth, a weather mage can 
determine precisely how they can use their power to tip the scales—generating devasting earthquakes or summoning a well-needed burst of rain. Spells from this style always replicate effects that could theoretically happen in the natural world, whether spawning sudden flash freezes or calling down lightning from a storm-black sky.

PLAYER OPTION:


THE CALM AND THE STORM
Spellcasters who draw their magic from the weather have learned that both stillness and calamity possess great power. From wizards who study the wrath of a thunderstorm to druids who inhabit the magic found in old trees, these dutiful practitioners respect the natural world. Some see themselves as protectors while others seek to exploit the raw power of a hurricane to fuel their spells.


The following archetypes provide guidance and abilities
to shape a character’s relationship with the natural world and its stormy expressions. Any spellcaster capable of casting 2nd-level spells may choose the archetype that feels most appropriate:
• Mudrunner. The rumble and roar of a mudslide flattening the world before it is music to you. Y ou are always slightly mud-caked, regardless of how much you wash. As an action, you can summon a muddy spirit for 1 minute who clears the ground before you. The spirit works in a 10-foot sphere centered on you, instantly removing any difficult terrain (magical or otherwise). This effect follows you as you move for the duration. Y ou cannot use this ability again until you complete a short or long rest.
• Skylighter. The flash and crack of lightning and the 
smell of ozone are home to you, and they beckon. Y our eyes and fingertips crackle permanently with it. Y ou know one fewer 2nd-level spell. As an action, you can summon a lightning spirit to electrify the air

CHAPTER 2 STYLES OF MAGICbefore you in a 15-foot cone. Creatures within this 
area must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw, taking 1d8 lightning damage and being paralyzed until the end of their next turn on a failed save or half as much damage with no additional effects on a successful one. Y ou cannot use this ability again until you complete a short or long rest.
• Snowflake. Merciless and beautiful, the freezing snow and ice arrive to blanket the world. Y our features are permanently tipped with frost, and your touch is cold. Creatures within 5 feet of you just cannot seem to stay warm. Y ou know one fewer 2nd-level spell. As an action, you can command an icy spirit to freeze a creature you can see within 60 feet. The target must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 11 (2d10) cold damage and having their speed reduced to 5 feet until the end if their next turn on a failed save or half as much damage with no additional effects on a successful one. Y ou cannot use this ability again until you complete a short or long rest.
• Wind Keeper. The wind is not only fascinating but also a friend. Y our appearance is permanently wind-blown: your hair is pressed back, and your clothes flutter subtly at all times. Creatures within 5 feet of you discover they cannot whistle. Y ou know one fewer 2nd-level spell. As an action, you may summon a wind spirit to carry you to an unoccupied space within 60 feet. This movement does not trigger opportunity attacks. Y ou cannot use this ability again until you complete a short or long rest.
MAGIC ITEMS: WEATHERVANES
This section presents unique items that harness the power of weather magic.


Freezing Weathervane
Wondrous Object, Uncommon


This simple tin and wood weathervane is shaped like a
snowflake. It can be worn around the neck as a pendant or sewn into the hood of a cloak. 
Bearing this weathervane, you may reduce any cold 
damage by an amount equal to your proficiency bonus. In 
addition, when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, its speed is reduced by 5 feet until the end of its next turn.


Fulminating Weathervane
Wondrous Object, Uncommon


This simple tin and wood weathervane is shaped like a
lightning bolt. It can be fitted onto the shoulder or helm. 
Bearing this weathervane, you can reduce any lightning 
damage you take by an amount equal to your proficiency 
bonus. In addition, your weapon attacks deal an additional 1 lightning damage.Heavy Weathervane
Wondrous Object, Uncommon


This simple stone and wood weathervane is shaped like
a rolling pile of rocks. It can be affixed to a shield or sewn to the front of armor or robes. 
Bearing this weathervane, you have advantage on all 
grappling checks. In addition, whenever you cast a spell 
that forces a creature to move, you can choose to move that creature an additional 5 feet.


CREATURE TRAITS
Y ou can create a themed version of an existing creature by giving it one or more of the following traits or actions:
• Crackling. This creature crackles with electricity. If you attempt a melee attack against it, you must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 1d8 lightning damage. The DC equals 10 + the creature’s highest ability modifier.
• Soaked. This creature is immune to fire damage. It magically creates enough drinking water for five creatures (including itself) each day.
• Whirling. Whenever this creature makes an attack, it can move its speed.
GRIMOIRE OF STORMS: OPUS TEMPESTAS 
The cover of this book bears an animated image of roiling storm clouds punctuated by flashes of lightning. A thin yellow spike topped by a sphere sticks out of the top of the book, wedged in place by the pages. The edges of the pages give the impression of being constantly damp.


Since the creation of Opus T empestas by its unidentified
storm giant author, it has generally resided with the giant’s kin, passed down as a gift through the generations of giant nobility. However, conflicts between the various clans of giants have seen the grimoire seized by enemy factions at various points in time, and the book seems to have disappeared completely, following the death of its latest owner, a sahuagin sorcerer named Calamity.


Grimoire Adventure Hooks
The grimoire can act as a potent reward for characters or serve as a plot device in adventures. Below are several hooks to utilize it in a campaign: 
• Adrift. A powerful sea witch has used the Opus T empestas to steal the winds around a port city. Sailors are stranded at sea with no way to move their vessels, and many will die unless the heroes can find a way to reach the witch’s island fortress. 
• Storm Scourge. The trade industry of a thriving metropolis is thrown into jeopardy when a cult in the nearby mountains acquires the Opus T empestas and uses it to torment the city. Officials are desperate to find a party willing to travel into the mountains, 
94
DEEP MAGIC VOLUME 2
confront the cult, and put a stop to the bizarre series of 
earthquakes, gale-force winds, and deadly rockslides 
plaguing the city. 
• Worthy Gift. A storm giant queen offers a challenge. Any heroes who can retrieve Opus T empestas from her storm giant rival in time for her daughter’s birthday celebration will be handsomely rewarded.


Opus Tempestas
Wondrous Item, Fabled (5th-Level and Higher Properties 
Require Attunement by a Spellcaster)


Opus T empestas is an epic that chronicles the story of the
first storm giant to wield the power of lightning. Its pages 
follow the hero Shelmesh in exhaustive detail, extoling his virtues and painstakingly describing the nature of every magical discovery made during his quest. Those who bear 
this tome are not only regaled with Shelmesh’s discoveries 
but are also imbued with a measure of the giant’s might.
While holding the grimoire, you can use it as a 
spellcasting focus for your spells, and it functions as a 
spellbook for you. Additionally, you do not suffer any negative effects imposed by extreme heat or cold while the grimoire is on your person.
When found, the book’s pages contain the following 
spells. Spells marked with an asterisk (*) appear in Chapter 5:
1st level: fog cloud, thunderwave2nd level: shamal’s grasp*, storm step*3rd level: call lightning, miniature hurricane*4th level: khamsin’s chariot*5th level: enshroud*6th level: monsoon*7th level: storm queen’s children*Opus Tempestas (Requires Attunement). As your level

CHAPTER 3 MAGIC IN YOUR CAMPAIGN


This chapter will give information for different ways you
can use magic in your campaign, such as new magical 
downtime rules, tools for creating exciting magical villains, and guidance on customizing spells. The Epic and Legendary Magic section of this chapter provides an overview of ways to incorporate high-level spellcasting and top-tier magic items in your RPG storytelling. This section includes how to capably integrate magic into a compelling narrative with satisfying consequences, how to effectively narrate and adjudicate the impact of wide-reaching magic, and how the ramifications of 
long -lasting magic can permanently alter a campaign—
for better or worse!


Downtime Activities
Characters aren’t always adventuring, saving the world, or looting ancient tombs. Sometimes they are enchanting 
arms or amor, brewing potions, or researching the magical 
mysteries that suffuse the world. Here you’ll find a variety 
of new downtime activities for characters to showcase their hobbies, create useful items for the group’s next big adventure, or make money on the side when they aren’t in 
immediate peril.


ENCHANTING ARMS AND ARMOR
Enchanting arms and armor is costly and time-
consuming, but the fruits of the labor are sought by king and hero alike. In addition to conventional resources, anyone attempting such enchantments must be proficient Magic In Your  Campaign
96
DEEP MAGIC VOLUME 2in the Arcana skill as well as in a set of artisan’s tools. 
Calligrapher’s supplies, jeweler’s tools, or tinkerer’s tools are commonly used to etch intricate runes or set magically empowered gemstones. However, enchanting is creative in practice, and each artisan may have their own method unique to them.
 
Resources and Resolution. The costs and requirements 
of enchanting an object are determined by the rarity of the enchantment (consult the Enchantment Activity Costs table). This in turn determines the rarity of the finished magic item. While no skill check or ability contest is needed to enchant something, you can enchant only one object at a time. Y ou must meet the minimum proficiency bonus requirement to enchant an item of a given rarity. Y ou don’t need to be a spellcaster to meet the spell level requirement, but you must have access to one spell of the listed level for each workweek. The spell can be from a magic item such as a spell scroll, a spellcasting friend, a hired spellcaster, or similar. The enchanted item is considered to be enchanted with a spell of that level for the purposes of spells and effects that remove or destroy magic, such as dispel magic. 
Enchanting Ammunition. The following section 
includes several enchantments you can imbue into objects. Only a few of these are suitable to be placed on ammunition: anointed, basic enhancement, dire critical, elemental wounding, foe bane, and torchlight. Y ou can enchant a batch of 10 ammunition of the same type, such as arrows or bolts, at a time, and you can never place multiple enchantments on the same batch of ammunition.
Enchanting Magic Items. Y ou can enchant a magic item, 
but to do so, you must meet the requirements for creating an enchantment of one rarity higher than the magic item’s current rarity. Y ou can’t enchant legendary magic items.
Multiple Enchantments. Y ou can imbue a single object 
with a number of enchantments up to your proficiency bonus, but you must imbue the object with one enchantment at a time, fulfilling the requirements of each enchantment separately.
Removing and Replacing Enchantments. T o remove an 
enchantment you placed on an object, you must spend one workweek of time. Removing an enchantment you created doesn’t have any other requirements. Y ou can replace an enchantment on an item only if you are changing the rarity level of a specific enchantment. For example, you can replace a +1 alacrity enchantment on an item with a +2 alacrity enchantment, but you can’t replace a +1 alacrity enchantment with a +1 prowess enchantment. When replacing an enchantment with the same enchantment of a different rarity, halve the time and gold requirements of the new enchantment’s rarity. Y ou must still meet all other requirements of enchanting an object with that new rarity.  
Using Multiple Enchanted Items. A creature can benefit 
from only one version of an enchantment at a time, regardless of the number of enchanted items the creature wears or carries. For example, a creature can wear +1 gloves of stealth prowess and +1 boots of acrobatics prowess, but if it wears a +2 cloak of stealth prowess, the gloves won’t function for that creature, their magic overridden by the cloak with a more potent version of the same enchantment. If both the gloves and cloak have the same enchantment bonus, the creature has to choose which to use, and the other item functions as if it didn’t have an enchantment while worn by that creature.


ENCHANTMENTS
This section includes more than a dozen enchantments you can imbue in objects. If you have an effect in mind that isn’t present in this section, work with your GM to invent your enchantment while using this downtime activity as a guideline. Each enchantment here includes the following information, detailing different aspects of the enchantment. 
Rarity. The listed rarity defines the rarity of the 
enchantment when determining the enchanting requirements for the object and the resulting rarity of the finished magic item.
Attunement. Each enchantment states whether the 
resulting magic item requires attunement to use the features detailed in the enchantment.
Category. Each enchantment notes the enchantment’s 
role or purpose, defined as offensive or defensive. This category gives guidance on the type of objects that can be imbued with the enchantment.  Offensive enchantments are typically placed on weapons while defensive enchantments are usually bestowed on armor, shields, and clothing, such as tunics, cloaks, gloves, boots, and similar.

Rarity: uncommon
Attunement: yes
Category: defensive


This simple but creatively flexible enchantment
imbues a suit of armor, shield, or piece of clothing with 
illusionary magic. A creature that wears an item with this 
enchantment can use a bonus action to make the item 
look different until the creature uses this bonus action 
again. The creature can change the general shape, color, 
detail, smell, and feel of the item, but the creature can’t 
change the item’s mass, size, or weight. A creature can use 
an action to inspect the item and must succeed on a DC 13 
Intelligence (Investigation) check to determine the item is 
covered in an illusion.


ENCHANTING OTHER OBJECTS
The enchanting detailed here applies only to weapons, 
armor, shields, and clothing. If you want to enchant rings, 
rods, books, mirrors, or other objects, work with your GM 
to determine which of the enchantments here would be the most applicable to the object and if there are other 
requirements to enchanting the object. For example, if 
you want to enchant a ring to become a ring of feather 
falling , none of the enchantments listed here would be 
applicable. In that case, the GM might require you have access to the feather fall spell throughout the enchanting 
but otherwise use the Enchantment Activity Costs table to determine the time, proficiency bonus, and cost 
requirements for enchanting a rare magic item.

DEEP MAGIC VOLUME 2ENCHANTING COMPLICATIONS
d6 Complication
1 Accidental Sentience.  Y ou’ve apparently poured too much of your heart and soul into your work, because now 
it talks back to you and claims it has a soul of its own. Work with your GM to determine the new sentient item’s 
personality, goals, and abilities.
2 Arcane Mishap.  That rune or word of power wasn’t supposed to explode. Now that your workstation is a 
mess, it will take time to clean up before you can get back to your work, increasing the downtime necessary to complete the enchantment by one workweek. 
3
Breach of Reality.  The ritual of your work has caused a metaphysical conflux, maybe for just a moment or 
perhaps longer. Perhaps an extradimensional being glimpsed your work and now takes interest, or perhaps you have altered the laws of arcana and physics on a local scale.
4
Interested Party. Y our arcane efforts have earned the attention of another individual, entity, or organization. 
They might demonstrate their sudden interest in whatever you have crafted right away, or they might hatch a long-term plot to steal or disrupt your work.
5
Ruined Material. A miscalculation, uneven scrollwork, a poorly etched rune, or similar mishap occurs. This 
mishap means you’ll have to replace some of your materials, entirely or only in part, doubling the cost it took to make the enchantment.
6
Unintended Feature. Oops! The language of your enchantment is full of double meaning and inverted 
intention. It is still sound, but the finished item now also has a weakness to a damage type or some other detrimental feature, or it might even be cursed.


ENCHANTING COMPLICATIONS
Bestowing enchantments certainly has its challenges: 
the delicate runework, sacred geometry, and precise incantations required are all too easy to fumble. Workshop mishaps are commonplace. Even successfully enchanting a weapon or bauble worthy of a king garners all sorts of attention from rival mages, nefarious agents, and collectors of magic. A character has a 10 percent chance of triggering a complication for each workweek spent enchanting an object. When a complication is triggered, the GM can create a complication or roll a d6 and consult the Enchanting Complications table.


POTION BREWING
Anyone with access to an herbalism kit and proficiency in its use and in Arcana can spend downtime sourcing rare reagents, extracting their essences, and distilling their effects in the alchemical pursuit of potion brewing.


POTION BREWING ACTIVITY
Rarity Cost Produced Over Time* Brewing DC
Common 1d12 × 5 gp Proficiency bonus + Intelligence modifier per day 11
Uncommon 1d10 × 50 gp 1 + Intelligence modifier per workweek 13
Rare 2d6 × 500 gp 1 + Intelligence modifier per 2 workweeks 15
Very Rare 1d10 × 5,000 gp 1 + Intelligence modifier per 4 workweeks 17
Legendary 1d12 × 12,500 gp 1 per 6 workweeks** 19Resources and Resolution. In addition to the necessary 
tools and proficiencies, brewing a potion requires upfront costs and three skill checks based on the rarity of the attempted potion. The GM uses the Potion Brewing Activity table, referring to the rarity of the potion to determine how much it costs to make, how many potions can be produced in the time allotted, and how difficult it is to brew that batch of potions. The character then makes a Wisdom (herbalism kit) check, an Intelligence (Arcana) check, and a third check that has a bonus equal to the character’s Wisdom, Intelligence, and Constitution modifiers combined, testing the character’s discipline in finishing the potion. 
After the results of the activity are determined, the 
potion is successfully brewed, regardless of how many successes were achieved. Any failures increase the chance that a complication will arise during the brewing process (see also the Potion Brewing Complications table).
*A character can spend downtime to brew multiple potions 
(minimum of 1 potion) of a different rarity as long as the character does not exceed their limit for the day or workweek. **Legendary potions require complete dedication and focus to brew successfully. A legendary potion cannot be successfully worked on at the same time as other potions.
101
CHAPTER 3 MAGIC IN YOUR CAMPAIGNPOTION BREWING COMPLICATIONS
d6 Complication
1 Early Spoilage. Well, that didn’t emulsify as you needed. The potion is still potable, but its effects only last half as 
long. It’s possible that whoever drinks it may need to make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or 
become poisoned for 10 minutes.
2 Inverted Effects. Oops! Y ou got the measurements for a couple of ingredients mixed up. The resulting potion might 
still be usable, though its effects now do the opposite of what you intended. Maybe you could rebrand your product as an acid, poison, or some sort of weapon?
3
Local Opposition. Y our brewing efforts have caused some manner of disruption. Y ou’ve earned the ire of someone 
else, whether a neighbor, guild, rival, or some other party that doesn’t appreciate your potioneering. 
4 Toxic Exposure.  Y ou’ve inhaled too deeply of your brewing’s fumes and now feel sick. Side effects might last for just 
a few moments, the rest of the workweek, or maybe even longer. 
5 Unintended Conjuring. Whether attracted by the heady aroma of whatever you are cooking or instead summoned 
by the just-right mix of material, somatic, and verbal components, you have inadvertently attracted the attention of a curious and possibly hostile creature.
6
Workstation Mishap.  A bubbled-over concoction, a burst alembic, a small explosion. Y our brewing efforts have 
damaged your equipment and wasted valuable reagents. This setback means you’ll have to replace some of your workstation and tools, maybe entirely or maybe only in part, doubling the cost it took to make the potion. 
Magic research points represent the character’s 
familiarity with magical theory and its applications. A 
character can spend one or more magic research points to use the following features.
Advantage (Costs 1 Magic Research Point). The 
character has advantage on the next Intelligence (Arcana or Religion) check made to recall lore about spells, magic items, symbols, creatures, rituals, or anything else magical in nature.
Find a Spell (Costs 1 or more Magic Research Points). 
The character can find a specific spell of 1st level or higher that can be copied into their spellbook. T o do so, the character must expend a number of points equal to the level of the spell they wish to find. For example, a wizard who wishes to find the 3rd-level spell dispel magic must expend 3 research points. Once a spell is found, a character must still expend the normal amount of gold and time to copy the spell into their spellbook. They are also bound to the same spell list restrictions concerning what spells can be copied into their spellbook.
Gain Minor Answer (Costs 2 Magic Research Points). 
The character learns the answer to a minor question. Minor answers are typically single true statements about a creature, place, or thing that most well-educated magical scholars could feasibly know. The following are some examples of minor answers:
• Finding a contact willing to buy or sell a particular magic item of common or uncommon quality.
• Identifying the correct cure or antidote to a magical curse, disease, or other arcane affliction.
• Learning a creature’s resistances, immunities, or other weaknesses.
• Learning the significance of a magical event or omen.
• Uncovering the last known location of a particular magic item or creature.POTION BREWING COMPLICATIONS
Handling delicate, potentially volatile reagents can produce undesirable results. For the unskilled or especially unlucky herbalist, this is often the rule rather than the exception. Whether dealing with the byproducts of an undesirable reaction or incurring the attention of disgruntled neighbors, there is always at least a 10 percent chance for a complication to occur every workweek of downtime spent. As outlined above, this chance increases by 20 percent for every skill check failure per workweek. When a complication is triggered, the GM can create a complication or roll a d6 and consult the Potion Brewing Complications table.


RESEARCHING MAGIC
A character can spend free time between adventures 
researching magic. Magical research can allow a character 
to better understand their foes, grant access to new 
spells, provide leads on the location of arcane treasures, or acquire all manner of arcane knowledge useful in unraveling the mysteries of the universe.
Researching magic covers a workweek of research. A 
character must spend one workweek with access to one or more suitable facilities that contain a variety of arcane tomes or scholars and also spend at least 250 gp acquiring appropriate materials, gifts, and other expenses required to conduct such research.


RESEARCH POINTS
After a workweek of magic research, a character makes an Intelligence (Arcana or Religion) check using the Magic Research table to determine the number of magic research points acquired that week. If a character has magic research points when making this check, add them to the check.

The character learns the answer to a major question.


Major answers are typically a collection of true statements
about a creature, place, or thing that only the most 
brilliant and experienced magical scholars—at the 
pinnacle of their field—could feasibly know. The following are some examples of major answers:
• Finding a contact willing to buy or sell a particular magic item of rare or greater quality.
• Learning part of a true name (see Chapter 2), a 
draconic rune (see Tome of Heroes), or similar piece of 
knowledge.
• Learning the location of a creature actively trying to 
avoid being found.


COMPLICATIONS
Characters who research magic face the difficult work of finding accurate sources, parsing huge amounts of esoteric information, and spending long hours distilling research into useful answers. In addition to the standard difficulties of this task, investigating the arcane can attract

Customizing Spells
Spellcasting is always a personal expression of power. 
Like any other form of expression, there are innumerable ways for a caster to practice their magic, and no two methods are precisely the same. This section introduces 
different ways spells can be enhanced or developed to 
better suit the caster.


COSMETIC CHANGES
The simplest way to personalize a spell is to change its 
cosmetic effects. With a little creativity, one wizard’s fireball can look completely different from another’s 
103
CHAPTER 3 MAGIC IN YOUR CAMPAIGNwithout altering what the spell actually accomplishes. If 
you have built your character using the themes from one of the styles presented in Chapter 2, you might consider how those adopted themes change the visual effects of every spell you cast. Perhaps your character is obsessed with the color pink and every spell incorporates some kind of color-based visual element. Imagination is the only real limit on these cosmetic alterations, making them the easiest way to make spells feel unique.


The Cosmetic Themes table includes some suggestions
that could inform the various ways you personalize your spell effects.


SPELL VARIANTS
Creating variations of existing spells is another option for spell customization. Creating variants is more complex than simply making cosmetic changes but can introduce exciting narrative twists to the game. For example, making a more specific—and limited use—version of a spell is a good way to introduce higher-level spells. Creating a variant of an existing spell is also a great way to “invent” new spells tailored to specific narrative situations or shake up effects of spells that have become less narratively impactful due to repeated use.


The following sections include examples of spell
variants from Chapter 5 and show examples of other ways you can customize a spell. Use the examples provided here or use them as examples to guide the process of creating your own spell variants.
V ariant Examples. This section contains riffs and twists 
for three classic spells: charm person, fireball, and raise dead. These experimental variations are meant to entertain


COSMETIC THEMES
d8 Theme Description
1 Birds Visuals shaped like birds or feathers, sounds of cawing or other bird calls, sensations of flight 
or freedom
2 Blood Visuals of blood or crimson stains, metallic smells, sounds of heartbeats, sensations of rushing adrenaline or creeping weakness
3 Community Visuals of ancestors or roaring hearths, smells of fresh bread or cider, sounds of laughter, sensations of comfort or warm embraces
4 Fate Visuals of threads or dice, sounds of spinning wheels or shuffling cards, sensations of déjà vu
5 Fungi Visuals shaped like mushrooms, smells of rot or decay, sounds of echoing caverns, sensations of dampness and darkness
6 Gothic  HorrorVisuals of supernatural beings or silver mist, smells of dust or potpourri, sounds of haunting melodies or cawing ravens, sensations of dread or despair
7 Paint Visuals shaped like paintbrushes or rainbow colors, smells of turpentine, sensations of creative chaos
8 Religion Visuals of halos or stained glass, smells of incense, sounds of choirs or chanting, sensations of peace or resolveplayers and GMs who are more experienced with—or 
even jaded by—the standard versions. Changes presented here affect both flavor and implementation, so the spells look different when cast, have different power levels, and even have radically different effects.
Each section covers one of the three standard spells, 
detailing variations on its theme. Some are similar in effect to the original but with altered story elements, and others have more pronounced tweaks to their effects in the game.


CHARM PERSON
Charm person is the classic enchantment, dating to the origins of the game itself. Its appeal is obvious: an enemy grants a friendly head start to retreating foes, a recalcitrant informant suddenly becomes talkative, or a town guard agrees to ignore a crime because that’s what friends do for each other. The variant spells listed here all work on this theme but with differing levels of power and specificity. The classes that have access to each of these spells can be found in Chapter 4, and each spell’s description can be found in Chapter 5.

DEEP MAGIC VOLUME 2FIREBALL


Fireball is perhaps the most iconic damage-dealing spell
ever, so why mess with it? Partly to add an interesting 
twist to something familiar, partly to give it a story or 
character spin, and partly just for fun. Here are some 
variant fireballs to consider. The classes that have access to each of these spells can be found in Chapter 4, and each spell’s description can be found in Chapter 5.
2nd Level
Solitary fireball (evocation)
3rd Level
Slow-burn fireball (evocation)
6th Level
Bouncing fireball (evocation)


Appearance and Type Changes
Fireball can be easily spiced up by changing its appearance 
and damage type. Roll a d20 and consult the Reskinning


Fireball table or choose the option that best suits the
spellcaster. The new appearance can become emblematic 
of that caster—as personal as a signature, a catchphrase, or a distinctive facial feature.All items created by a variant appearance vanish as soon 
as their damage is done, and no items or materials can be recovered.


Power Changes
Fireball is an instantaneous spell, but it might just as easily resemble heat metal, providing a round of warning, a round 
of damage, and a round of additional damage. Spreading out the damage this way could be called a slow-burn fireball. Though this is a bit more bookkeeping, such a spell would be appropriate for limited use by a pyromancer.
While fireball is an area of effect spell, a smaller version 
could attack a single target. This might be called solitary fireball, and it could easily find a place in a pyromancer’s spellbook or in the hands of a fire imp or an efreeti.
Finally, the third variant here is a bouncing fireball, which 
(as the name implies) strikes one location, then bounces according to the caster’s direction to a second location and explodes again. This is similar to how chain lightning 
works, but bouncing fireball attacks multiple targets in 
both locations. The tradeoff is lower damage against each creature when compared to chain lightning.

RAISE DEAD
Raise dead is another spell with roots in the game’s 
earliest days. The variants here are twisted, limited, or 
expanded in several ways. They all return a creature 
to life but in unexpected ways: as ghosts, for a short 
period, without memories or skills, or under a particular compulsion. The classes that have access to each of these spells can be found in Chapter 4, and each 
spell’s description can be found in Chapter 5.

Character and Effect Changes
Two aspects of raise dead are easy to change: the raised 
creature’s appearance and the traumatic effect of returning to life. The Raise Dead Random Effects table offers a dozen options for reskinning raise dead in 
 RAISE DEAD RANDOM EFFECTS
d10 Effect
1 Armor of the Planes.  The raised creature gains resistance to cold, fire, lightning, or necrotic damage (caster’s 
choice) for 7 days.
2 Breath of Life.  The caster absorbs one magical disease, curse, or similar effect from the target creature into 
themselves. The affliction ends on the newly raised creature but takes full effect on the caster, who must get it cured 
or removed by standard means.
3 Exhaustion. Restoring a soul is as debilitating on the caster as on the dead. The caster suffers the same penalty on 
attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks as the raised creature.
4 Gravetouched. The raised creature has an uncanny voice or appearance that frightens nonhostile animals 
(including mounts), children, and even adults unaccustomed to such things. Charisma (Intimidation) checks are made with advantage.
5
Mild Spirit. The raised creature returns to life possessed of a gentle kindness. It refuses to fight, argue, or even 
defend itself for a period of 1d6 + 1 days. This unnatural calm can be removed by a calm emotions spell. It also ends if 
the creature is rendered unconscious by an attack.
6 Neophyte.  The raised creature forgets one language, one spell or feat, one friend, and one class ability. These 
memories return in a random sequence at a rate of one per week until all are recovered.
7 Raging Spirit. The raised creature returns to life in the grip of intense and uncontrollable rage. It immediately 
attacks the caster and anyone else nearby, including friends, acolytes, and such. This anger ends when the creature becomes unconscious or when it’s affected by a calm emotions spell or comparable magic.
8
Servitor. The raised creature is charmed by the caster. While charmed in this way, the creature serves the caster 
loyally as repayment for restoring them to life. The length of this service is determined by the caster’s spellcasting level: up to level 11 is a week, level 12–14 is a month; level 15 or higher is a year. The effect is broken if the caster or the caster’s companions cause direct harm to the charmed creature or its loved ones.
9
Thundercrack.  When raise dead is cast, the target’s return to life is heralded by a crack of thunder and a stroke of 
lightning. These can be heard and seen for at least a mile and may be accompanied by a sudden, brief storm.
10 Voice of the Afterlife.  The raised creature gained subconscious knowledge of a distant plane during its sojourn in 
the realm of the dead. It now speaks either Abyssal, Celestial, Infernal, Satarre, or Umbral (player’s choice).
106
DEEP MAGIC VOLUME 2random ways. When the spell is cast, roll a d12 or choose 
the option that best suits the situation or the caster. This change need not be a one-time thing and can be emblematic of that caster, as recognizably personal as a signature, a catchphrase, or a coat of arms.
Epic & Legendary Magic


Consider the most epic magical moments of the most
memorable fantasy tales. The dauntless gray wizard dueling the flame-wielding force of darkness atop a snowy mountain peak, an arcane staff in one hand and a legendary elven blade in the other. The sickly warlock emperor of a dying nation whose sentient black blade helps him save the multiverse before eventually claiming the lives of his closest kin. The bastard son of an Olympian god who turned an invulnerable leviathan to stone with a monstrous severed head, slaying one titan to thwart another. The glorious list goes on.


One particularly salient trait shared among these
classic fantasy narratives is a certain uniqueness of those magical moments that distinguish them. Whether the stuff of sorcery or providence, magic as a concept and a storytelling tradition speaks directly to the very human need to change the world. But, how does magic shape the narrative in roleplaying games?


This section offers guidance on how to best include
high-level spellcasting and top-tier magic items in storytelling, including how to capably integrate magic into a compelling narrative with satisfying consequences, how to effectively narrate and adjudicate the impact of wide-reaching magic, and how the ramifications of long-lasting magic can permanently alter a campaign (for better or worse).


MAGIC AS A PLOT DEVICE
Roleplaying games are motivated by a set of mechanical considerations, bound together by rules, that feature a transparent, career-long progression for adventurers: a progression already known, even anticipated, by the player when each character is created. As gamers, this conceit is heartily embraced. But as storytellers, it can easily be ignored entirely, simply written off. And while there may be a hesitation to let the mechanics drive stories, they are still a fundamental part of the game.
How then can magic drive a story? How are those 
adventures shaped? Part of the answer lies in the thematic context of the mechanics themselves. Likewise, inspiration can be gathered from timeless fantasy 

107
CHAPTER 3 MAGIC IN YOUR CAMPAIGNstories with magic at their narrative core. From spells as 
adventure hooks to magic items as narrative milestones, magic can be a potent plot device.


SPELLS AS PLOT DEVICES
The number of ways spells can be used as a plot device are as numerous as the spells themselves, both in terms of aesthetics and conflict. Here are a few examples of timeless plots featuring magic spells as a prime mover:
• A beautiful and malevolent queen uses illusion magic to adopt the guise of a peasant while clandestinely attempting to poison her innocent rival, a girl ordained as the fairest in all the land.
• A king’s sister studies dark magic from their wizened, 
half-demon mentor only to use it against them both in 
an attempt to claim the kingdom for herself.
• A once-proud forest has fallen under the accursed spell 
of an evil undead necromancer, and its people shelter in silence from an encroachment of giant monstrous arachnids and other loathsome hazards.
• An undying nobleman from a foreign land uses blood magic to charm a young woman who resembles his dead lover, and her husband and a party of monster hunters must take up occult arms to save her.
One of the easiest ways to utilize magic as a plot device in a campaign is by populating the game world with spellcasting NPCs, characters who drive the narrative with particular milestones and pivot points. But the relationship of these NPCs to the player characters is always key and should be a leading factor when it comes to creative planning. How, to what extent, and why do the machinations of these spellcasters affect the characters? And what impact do they have on the story itself?


Magic is ultimately a resource in the fictional worlds that
contain it. Whether magic comes from a grimoire, a god, or the supernatural ability of some creature, a spell effect is decidedly disruptive, and even the simplest spell can change the course of a campaign. Correlate such magical disruptions to ongoing character choices, and the story naturally evolves from that spell or spellcaster’s influence.


SPELL LISTS AS ADVENTURE HOOKS
For an easy and clever method to use spells as plot devices, look no further than the characters’ spell lists, which serve as a veritable road map for how the characters will be able to interact with their world over time. Subvert player expectations by using those known spell lists as adventure hooks for the campaign. 
For example, each time a wizard character gains a 
wizard level in the game, the player can add two wizard spells of their choosing to their spellbook for free. However, where or how the wizard learns these spells is left relatively vague. Use this as an opportunity to introduce new NPCs, expand the plot, or send the characters on a wild side adventure. Here are some examples of scenarios where a character might obtain knowledge of a new spell:
• A supernatural entity bestows the character with specific arcane knowledge whenever that character reaches certain milestones of lived experience and promises to one day call in this favor.
• An elder race of immortals transcribed rare spells upon their most precious works of art before hiding the art in feretories within nineteen shadow-haunted citadels.
• Spells endure as an oral tradition of various displaced cultures and can only be learned from the lone orators who dedicate their lives to remembering these spells and the stories that contain them.
• The character must procedurally seek out and reunite the scattered pages of a notorious wizard’s lost grimoire, learning a new spell every few pages and discovering the truth behind the wizard’s disappearance once the grimoire is complete.
New spells, such as those found in this book, can introduce some fresh and dynamic elements to a campaign that quickly pushes the limits of expectation (from both sides of the GM’s screen). When looking at the spells in this book, consider what kind of person or creature would possess the knowledge of how to cast such a spell and how that person or creature relates to the characters, their classes and themes, and their goals. In this way, the players can subtly shape the world and story simply by preferring one class over another or one spell school or style over another.
When considering spell lists as adventure hooks, 
remember that different classes may be variably suited for different campaign styles, and remember that the narrative potential of each class is ultimately an expression of the mechanical considerations that define it. The divine magic of clerics, for instance, is quite similar to the nature-based magic of druids and their ilk, but they are still distinct from each other, despite several shared spells. A wizard’s arcane magic bears pointed similarities to the arcane magic of sorcerers and warlocks, but the nuances between the spell lists, how each class learns spells, and how an individual’ spells manifest via game mechanics are unique. Such distinctions can be a bountiful source of narrative inspiration when examined through a storytelling lens. 
Moreover, the relationships between the different 
magical traditions and divine orders of a game world can be their own source of dramatic conflict. Here are examples of class-driven story threads:
• A devout order of clerics comes to discover that their deity also serves as the otherworldly patron for a furtive cult of warlocks and must somehow reconcile their faith.

108
DEEP MAGIC VOLUME 2• An evil wizard summons a representative from 
each of the arcane traditions to compete in a grand tournament but secretly plans to cull spells from their varied grimoires for use in an eldritch rite.
• Druids of the elder groves whisper tales of a fallen star that warps the surrounding landscape—and their magic along with it.
• The ghost of a fabled bard is rumored to sing the songs of each and every college while haunting the mist-strewn hillocks of his moorland grave.


MAGIC ITEMS AS PLOT DEVICES
Magic items have been a staple form of treasure for 
adventurers since the first d20 hit a gaming table. The 
social contract was simple: characters brave terrors and 
risk their lives in the dungeon, and they’re remunerated with appropriate rewards. Keep in mind, as balanced as the game ever is, magic items typically don’t factor into that calculating, existing outside of it. This confirms a simple truth of most fantasy roleplaying games: magic, by its very nature, changes the rules.


Similar to using spells and spell lists as noted earlier in
this section, one simple way to effectively integrate magic items into a gameplay narrative is to present them not merely as quest rewards but as expositors of the campaign world itself. The lore surrounding individual enchanted items could easily turn out to be just as (if not more) memorable as the various boons they provide characters. Justifiably, magic items that exist solely to benefit the characters on their current and future adventures are an expected conceit of the game. There’s no shame in that, but there is a ripe opportunity for something more creatively satisfying. 
When preparing a magic item as a reward, consider 
how it will shape the campaign to come (if at all), what, beyond its statistics, makes it a satisfying reward for the players’ actions, and how (if at all) it fulfills the players’ expectations or goals for their characters. T aking this a step further, narrative arcs or even entire campaigns can be crafted around a select few magic items, from removing powerful items from enemy hands, to destroying a magic item to stop a catastrophe, to acquiring a legendary magic item to gain a specific power needed to defeat a great evil.


USING LARGE-SCALE MAGIC
IN YOUR CAMPAIGNS
When using large-scale magic in a campaign, one key consideration is how this potent magic categorically affects the world around it. What are the ramifications for the world and its inhabitants? And how does it alter the way the player characters are viewed? As the characters change the world they live in, be prepared to relate back to them precisely how and why it changes. Large-scale magic comes with large-scale consequences, whether good or bad.T alking about large-scale magic can take many forms: 
from range and area of effect to the number of targets affected and so on. Some higher-level spells are infamous for their extreme mechanical parameters and should be scrutinized from this perspective before introducing them to any game session, let alone an entire campaign. Surprises are part of the fun, but it’s important to maintain a certain amount of clarity and forethought once the characters have access to such magic.


A successful implementation of large-scale magic in a
campaign can rely heavily on an intimate understanding of the spells and abilities at everyone’s disposal. With that in mind, here a few spells that represent large-scale magic and some of the large-scale consequences that can come with them:
• Astral Projection. This radical 9th-level spell transports the astral bodies of up to nine creatures to the Astral Plane—an endless, open domain of thought and dream. Astral projection can last quite a long time, providing an opportunity for the party to explore an entire “campaign within a campaign” as long as they’d like (or as long as the spell holds up).
• Control Weather. This 8th-level spell allows the 
caster to manipulate the weather within 5 miles of themselves for up to 8 hours. The wide reach of this environmental transmutation is undeniable, and its narrative possibilities are both subtle and sweeping.
• Earthquake. The name of the spell says it all. For up to a minute, the caster of this 8th-level spell is able to create seismic fissures throughout a 
200-foot -di ameter area with a range up to 500 feet. Of 
particular note, a fissure that opens beneath a structure 
causes it to automatically collapse, meaning—with enough time and without distraction—earthquake could be used to level an entire village or even city.
• Forbiddance. This 6th-level spell wards up to 40,000 
square feet of floor space (to a height of 30 feet) from magical travel. When is the last time the gaming group measured a 40,000-square-foot section of the battle mat?
• Gate. Along with other teleport spells, gate  allows 
characters to travel to a different plane of existence. Like astral projection and plane shift, this becomes a shortcut to expanding the scale of a campaign by introducing characters to wider and stranger worlds.
• Magnificent Mansion. When larger-scale magic 
without necessarily breaking the world is required, the sprawling, extradimensional dwelling created by this 7th-level spell offers characters a massive safe space to enjoy.
• Mass Suggestion. Enchanting up to 12 creatures at once is no small effort, but mass suggestion is up to the task. The social ramifications of this 6th-level spell are numerous, from influencing a king’s court, to 
109
CHAPTER 3 MAGIC IN YOUR CAMPAIGNchanging the votes of a city’s council, to convincing a 
cult’s leadership to disband the cult—or even to form one in the first place!
• Meteor Swarm. A favorite of spellcasters that enjoy destruction, meteor swarm is a deadly 9th-level spell capable of creating four 40-foot-radius spheres of blazing fire with a range of 1 mile. This spell can turn the tide of battle for an army, decimate a castle’s walls and defenders, or even terrorize a populace by igniting and destroying farmland.
• Mirage Arcane. Like hallucinatory terrain before it, this 
7th-level spell is capable of manifesting false terrain. But unlike lesser versions of the same illusion, mirage arcane goes big by affecting a large area and making the illusion tangible to those interacting with it. A noxious swamp can be made to appear safe to unwary travelers, an important oasis can be hidden among the desert’s dunes, a village can be disguised to appear more or less affluent to fool visiting dignitaries—the possibilities are truly endless!
• Move Earth. While not as powerful as many of the spells on this list, this 6th-level spell allows the caster to remodel a new 40-foot square of terrain every 10 minutes for the 2-hour duration. An enterprising transmuter can do a lot of remodeling in 2 hours!
• Plane Shift. This 7th-level spell can transport up to eight creatures to a different plane of existence. With interplanar travel at their fingertips, players may quickly turn a campaign into one of large-scale exploration.
• Scrying. This unassuming 5th-level spell allows the caster to see and hear a particular creature that is on the same plane of existence. That’s quite a lot of breathing room when it comes to expanding the scale of the game world, especially for characters that have already done some exploring and met a variety of NPCs. That king the characters met at level 1 as a prince in need of help is now someone the characters can easily observe. Similarly, an innkeeper that gave the characters trouble ages ago might now be a cult leader the characters have to observe. This spell can be a conduit to give characters a reason to scry on something far afield, allowing them to literally broaden their horizons.
• Storm of Vengeance. This 9th-level spell conjures a deadly storm cloud with a radius of 360 feet that can affect creatures up to 5,000 feet beneath it. While not as wide-reaching as control weather, storm of vengeance is just the kind of conjuration needed when the battle gets a little too big.USING LONG-TERM MAGIC


IN YOUR CAMPAIGNS
With a greater understanding of the effects of wide-ranging magic on both story and setting, now consider duration. How is a campaign affected by the introduction of powerful, long-lasting magic, and what are the key considerations for the long-term proliferation of supernatural phenomena? If magic changes the rules, it can be expected to change the landscape as well. All encounters and characters, even the essence of the game world itself, are presumed mutable—altered by the very fantasy that defines them.


The application of long-term magic can be a satisfying
compliment to using spell lists to create adventure hooks (detailed earlier in this section), particularly when it comes to a caster’s subclass or arcane tradition of choice. Spells that share a theme can act as waypoints for the evolution of narrative ideas throughout a campaign, which is to say, one spell logically follows the other along a caster’s path of progression. In many ways, this also becomes a quest for permanence—the more powerful the spell, the more enduring its impact on the game world. Spells of higher levels often have longer durations, and some higher-level magic becomes long-term by default. With that in mind, here a few long-lasting spells and examples of the campaign-altering effects they can have:
• Clone. The duplicate creature created by this 8th-level spell is permanent and is actually capable of receiving the soul of the original creature upon their death. This could allow an evil spellcaster to never truly be vanquished so long as their clones survive, prompting the characters to go on an adventure to capture or eliminate all the clones.
• Feeblemind. The damage wrought upon a creature’s 
intellect and personality by this 8th-level spell has the potential to last forever if the affected subject fails their saving throw every month. A bit unlikely perhaps, but intriguing nonetheless when it comes to long-term considerations. What if a powerful spellcaster used this spell on the one person that knew the spellcaster’s only weakness, forcing the characters to find a cure before they can put a stop to the spellcaster’s terrible plans?
• Gate. On top of its far-reaching transportation properties, this popular 9th-level spell—like the entire suite of spells akin to it—can unwittingly introduce denizens from other planes of existence to a game world. Even at early levels, this can have long-lasting impacts on a campaign—especially if the gate serves as an access point for malevolent extraplanar beings.
• Geas. The default duration for this potent 5th-level 
spell is 30 days, but at 9th-level, geas becomes nigh permanent—ending only by the successful casting of the remove curse, greater restoration, or wish spells. Since the affected person still has full control of themselves 
110
DEEP MAGIC VOLUME 2outside of performing the task, the characters might 
not figure out their favorite NPC is under a spell until much later in the campaign, allowing for subtle, long-term storytelling.
• Mass Suggestion. At the highest level of casting, this 6th-level spell can affect up to 12 creatures for a year and a day. As with this spell’s entry earlier in this section, mass suggestion has numerous campaign-affecting applications both in scale and duration.
• Modify Memory. While this 5th-level spell lasts, the caster can permanently affect the target’s memory of an event that it experienced within the last 24 hours that lasted no more than 10 minutes. The subtlety of this kind of social encounter is often challenging, but the story richness and rewards on both sides of the GM screen can be everlasting.
• Reincarnate. This 5th-level spell fashions a new body for a deceased creature to inhabit, which likely causes the creature’s race to change. The inner (and outer) conflict that can arise from such a transposition is certainly the stuff of drama and will no doubt leave its mark throughout the length of a campaign.
• Simulacrum. When speaking of long-term magic, simulacrum comes quickly to mind. The illusory duplicate created by this 7th-level spell is nearly permanent, lasting until it’s dispelled, and can even be alchemically repaired. Similar to clone, this can allow a villain or even a character to subtly manipulate the story over a long period of time.
• Symbol. The harmful glyph created by this 7th-level spell lasts until dispelled or triggered. When it comes to spellcasters leaving a permanent mark to trap or protect their secrets for decades or even centuries, accept no substitutes.
• Wish. This 9th-level conjuration is the mightiest spell a mortal creature can cast. By simply speaking aloud, they can alter the very foundations of reality in accord with their desires, setting the stage for a long-lasting, wide-reaching mechanical disruption that can (and will) affect a campaign for the rest of its run. This kind of extensive arcane creation is the very essence of the topics in this section, and it can truly shape stories at the gaming table.
Aside from spells, magic items (and cursed items in particular) can also introduce long-term—and often permanent—ramifications into a campaign. The infamous story “The Monkey’s Paw,” by W .W . Jacobs, treats us to a salient study in precisely how talismanic magic (and ill-fated decisions) can have an enduring effect on the narrative.Villains   Using Magic
Magic is a brilliant tool in the hands of heroes, but in the hands of villains, magic is turned to sinister purpose, often causing chaos, fear, and mayhem. And as the 
characters’ mastery of magic increases, so too should 
the villains’ mastery. Ensuring foes have access to all the 
resources, trickery, and danger that magic readily provides is important to building compelling adventures and raising the campaign stakes to provide worthy challenges.


This section contains various tools to inspire
the creation of truly dastardly schemes, powerful 
magic -centered f actions, and potent magical grimoires 
with world-shattering potential.


VILLAINOUS MAGIC SCHEMES
The first step to creating a compelling villain is choosing their motivation. Deciding on a villain’s ultimate goal 
provides an excellent starting point for building more 
intricate plots and short-term goals. The Villainous 
Schemes table presents options suitable as core schemes for any magical villain.


SAMPLE VILLAINOUS FACTIONS
This section provides sample villainous factions ready to 
drop into a campaign or use as inspiration for creating 
magic-centered villains. 
SAMPLE FACTION: THE MUSES
Alignment: T rue Neutral
Organization: League of cosmic guardians 
Motto: We are the honed instruments of fate.
Born from the twisting tides of destiny, the celestial 
beings known as Muses are the self-appointed guardians 
of fate. This organization views the universe as the 
pinnacle of cosmic perfection, where fate’s plan rules all 
beings who don’t stray from their predestined path.


Creed
The Muses are committed to preserving the sanctity 
of the divine plan by whatever means necessary. They 
continuously read the web of fate, and when threats to 
its patterns emerge, one or more of them are dispatched 
to nudge circumstances back onto their proper path. 
Whenever possible, a muse attempts subtle coercion—
inspiring the right creatures to take the right actions at 
the right times—but they don’t shy from taking more 
extreme action when necessary. Since they have no 
allegiances beyond their commitment to the divine plan, 
they intercede on behalf of good or evil forces in equal 
measure. Their fixation on neutrality has more than once 
made them pawns in the plans of greater villains.

Far away and long ago, the Golden Dawn ran their empire 
from glittering thrones, ruled by immortal sorcerer-kings. Hubris led to magical calamity that wiped the civilization from the earth and living memory—but with the last 
of their power, one sorcerer-king cast a single city out 
of time, saving their subjects from the fate that befell 
their brethren. Thrown through space and time into the modern age, the people of the Golden Dawn now seek to rebuild what was lost, using their ancient sorcery to 
incinerate all who stand in their way.MUSES ADVENTURE HOOKS
d4 Adventure Hook
1 A famous prophet aligned with the Muses issues a public call for the characters to be brought before them to “be 
judged for their transgressions against the universe.” The public is unaware of the muses’ involvement, but the prophet is respected enough to warrant a realm-wide search for the heroes.
2 Artists across the world begin to die as the muses force them to ceaselessly create works of art that show how events should come to pass. The characters are alerted to this ongoing epidemic when an artist friend or contact is seized with the same dangerous mania and is certain to die of exhaustion if the party doesn’t intercede. 
3 The characters hear rumors of a band of mysterious knights that have been murdering random people across the region. There are four knights in total, each with a different emblem: a cup, a sword, a pentacle, and a wand. It is unclear what connects the knights’ victims, but villagers across the land are seeking adventurers to stop them.
4 The Muses kidnap a young girl with remarkable powers of prescience. Her parents hire the characters to retrieve their missing daughter.

1 A government official makes a secret pact with the Golden Dawn, providing the faction with a base of operations 
inside their city in exchange for powers that begin to corrupt them. If left unchecked, the official begins terrorizing citizens with cruel treatment and barbaric new laws.
2 After the sudden appearance of an ancient city mere miles away, a local ruler hires the characters to escort a group of scholars and diplomats instructed to learn more about the settlement and its people.
3 Followers of the Golden Dawn have begun torching temples and attacking clerics dedicated to gods of light or fire, proclaiming such deities to be false idols.
4 In an effort to learn more about potential threats, the Golden Dawn invites renowned adventurers to attend a festival in their city. Attendees are encouraged to participate in a series of gladiatorial competitions.


Creed
The people of the Golden Dawn are obsessed with 
recovering the glory and power they lost—but they are well aware of the precarious position they are in. Their immediate goal is to secure the area around their city, and then they will forge alliances with whatever governments or entities are nearby. Once their position is secured, the Golden Dawn will infiltrate rival nations, learn their secrets, and begin their conquest—forcing all to bend the knee to their reborn glory.


Membership
The Golden Dawn is ruled by a sorcerer-king and a cadre of mage-priests who possess terrifying arcane abilities. Below 
them sits the common citizenry, who were transported along with the city, but nearly all of these citizens also possess a measure of their leaders’ arcane mastery over light and flame. As the Golden Dawn’s influence grows, they actively recruit followers from the nations they infiltrate—frequently offering power in exchange for loyalty. However, the Golden Dawn views these followers as little more than tools to be used and discarded.

VILLAINOUS GRIMOIRES
Magic items are a terrific tool for creating compelling 
villains and their schemes. Even the most unimpressive mage can become a nigh-unstoppable foe with one of the following grimoires in hand. Alternatively, if the characters acquire one of these fabled items, there are no shortage of villains who will do their utmost to claim such objects to further their own dark agendas.
GRIMOIRE OF LIFE AND DEATH:


CODEX AETERNUS
This oddly bound grimoire appears to be two separate tomes with separate covers and spines, though bound fore-edge to fore-edge with a common back cover shared by both. The left cover features 
the image of a dark, cloaked figure while the right displays a 
healer. Metal clasps in the shape of hourglasses keep the two 
covers closed.
Hertha and Jarisi Wymane were the last, and certainly most idealistic, apprentices of the famed white necromancer Athaghast. At his side, the young twin women gained enlightenment about the cyclic connections between life and death. It was the twins who aided their master in the creation of his Grinning Skull, an artifact Athaghast used to restore the balance after an unprecedented influx of undead in the land. Though they learned together, the twins each gravitated toward a different side of the necromantic triad. Hertha studied the healing arts, learning to cure disease, mend bone, and remove vile curses. Contrariwise, Jarisi delved deeply into the study of undeath, perfecting the arts of reanimation and the effects the undead have upon the living.


After their master vanished along with the
Grinning Skull, the twins closed themselves up in his tower and used the resources there to pen the Codex Aeternus. Much as they were themselves, their grimoire possessed two separate books bound together. They planned for the dual tome to be the definitive work on white necromancy as well as the great triad of life, death, and un-life. The twins wished, above all else, to ensure their work would be more useful than just a dry academic discussion, and each worked their most powerful magic into the tome.


The Wymane sisters used the grimoire to perform acts
viewed as miracles. They raised the dead, healed wounds 
that resisted other curative enchantments, brought ancient figures back to life to reveal lost secrets, and even continued 
their former master’s crusade against the vampiric courts. It was no doubt this last act that proved their undoing. The twins vanished, leaving only their grimoire behind. T oday, it is believed several copies of the Codex Aeternus exist, but their owners often meet grisly ends.


Grimoire Adventure Hooks
The grimoire can act as potent reward for characters or serve as a plot device in adventures. Here are several hooks to utilize it in a campaign.
Lich’s Bargain. Word has reached a patron of the 
characters that the Codex Aeternus is due to be traded to a lich by an underground figure known to them. When they reach the meeting place though, they find the lich gravely wounded and its phylactery compromised. The undead lord promises them great riches if they will recover the grimoire and use it to repair its phylactery.

CHAPTER 3 MAGIC IN YOUR CAMPAIGNMask of Autumn. A local ruler has fallen ill to a malady 
that no prayer or healing can cure. The only hope is said 
to lie in the Codex Aeternus. Braving the masked ball of a vampire queen to bargain for the grimoire, the characters learn that they themselves are the main attraction.
Vengeance, Saith the Twins. By some means, 
the characters have acquired the Codex Aeternus. Unfortunately, a series of healing mishaps and undead attacks seem to originate from the grimoire, and they are growing worse. In truth, the characters are plagued by undead versions of Hertha and Jarisi, who want the characters to abandon the tome.


CODEX AETERNUS
Wondrous Item, Fabled (5th-Level and Higher Properties Require Attunement by a Spellcaster)


The dual nature of the Codex Aeternus is reflected in its
two-tome binding, with “death” on the left and “life” on the right. The death tome contains necromantic rituals and treatises on the undead, while the life tome reflects on the nature of the divine and details healing methods and medicinal herbs. The owner of the grimoire gradually becomes interested in learning and performing funerary rites and medicinal remedies.
If attuned to it, you can use the grimoire as a 
spellcasting focus, and it functions as a spellbook for you. Moreover, when you finish a long rest while this tome is in your possession, you can choose either the chill touch or spare the dying cantrip. If you are holding the tome, you can cast the cantrip you selected at will. 
When found, the book contains the following spells. 
Spells marked with an asterisk (*) appear in Chapter 5:
1st level: cure wounds, inflict wounds2nd level: prayer of resolve*, wound surge*3rd level: animate dead, revivify4th level: death toll*, halo of blood and tears*5th level: contingency boils*, raise dead6th level: create undead, harm, heal7th level: defile healing*, finger of death9th level: afflict line*, true resurrection
Tome of Duality (Requires Attunement). As your level 
increases, you gain the following benefits while the 
grimoire is on your person. Saving throws for its features equal your spell save DC.
5th level. As a reaction when you take necrotic damage, 
you can transmute some of the damage into healing energy. Y ou negate an amount of damage equal to 1d10 + your proficiency bonus and heal yourself or a creature of your choice within 10 feet by the same amount. 
9th level. As an action, one undead creature that you 
can see within 30 feet must make a Wisdom saving throw, taking 8d6 radiant damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. If the target is reduced to 0 hit points by this attack, an exact copy of the creature appears in an adjacent unoccupied square and is under your control.


The copy has the statistics of the original creature as it
was at the beginning of your turn. As a bonus action on each of your turns, you can mentally command the copy if it is within 120 feet of you. Y ou decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete. The copy lasts for a number of rounds equal to your proficiency bonus, and then it vanishes.


Y ou can use this feature three times and regain all
expended uses when you finish a long rest. 
13th level. Y ou can use your action to cast either the 
finger of death or the resurrection spell. Once you do so, you can’t use this feature again until you finish a long rest. 
In addition, after you take damage from radiant or 
necrotic damage, you become immune to that type of damage for 1 minute. If you take damage from the other type while under the effect of this feature, you lose your immunity in favor of becoming immune to the new type, and the duration resets to 1 minute.
17th level. Y our Intelligence or Wisdom score (your 
choice) increases by 2, to a maximum of 20. An undead creature who targets you with an attack or harmful spell must first succeed on a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature must choose a new target or lose that attack or spell. Moreover, whenever a spell or effect that restores hit points is used within 30 feet of your position, 
you regain hit points equal to half as much as the original spell or effect. 
Quirks of the Codex Aeternus. While attuned to the 
grimoire, you occasionally experience the emotions and attitudes of its previous owners, who have left their psychic imprint upon it. While you are not compelled to act on these feelings, you might randomly experience one of the quirks presented in the Quirks of the Codex Aeternus table.
GRIMOIRE OF THE CELESTIAL:


ARTES BELLATOR
This beautiful tome is surrounded by a nimbus of light. A thin golden lattice decorates the cover, which is embossed with interlocking divine glyphs. Faintly, the sound of a celestial chorus emanates from the grimoire.
Elenora Falco was a clerical novice, young but very 
devout. She wished for nothing more than to serve her deity, an ancient god of war. Despite her yearning, her requests for martial service were denied time and again. In desperation, she searched the vast library of her temple, hoping to find something, some way to prove her worth. 
116
DEEP MAGIC VOLUME 2In a dusty scroll, she discovered a ritual that would bind 
her to her god as something more than cleric, more than paladin. She would become an avatar. 
For many months, she prepared and planned, and 
finally performed the celestial ritual. She pledged herself to her god, and her god answered. When the ritual was complete, Elenora found the Artes Bellator in her hands.
Using the grimoire, Elenora could generate any weapon 
she wished, wielding them to defend her temple and thwart evil. Many young paladins flocked to her side, and they accomplished many great deeds. But time, even for a divine avatar, can conquer any foe. 
Following Elenora’s final request, the temple of the god 
of war constantly searches for someone worthy to wield the Artes Bellator.


Grimoire Adventure Hooks
The grimoire can act as potent reward for characters or serve as a plot device in adventures. Here are several hooks to utilize it in a campaign.
A Crusade Untold. An outbreak of demons in a nearby 
kingdom prompts the local bishop to hire the characters to lead a small assault force to besiege an isolated fortress. Somewhere within the walls of the keep is an active portal to the realms below. With a force of demons and cultists standing in their way, the bishop gives one of the group the Artes Bellator. 
Broken Book. Something is wrong with the Artes 
Bellator. When not producing weaponry, the grimoire randomly spawns strange aberrations. The characters may have already acquired the tome, or they might have been hired by its current owner. Either way, the quest to fix the grimoire takes the characters into the celestial realms where they must appease the god of war himself. 
Warlord’s Captive. Somehow the great khan, Vendris 
Wyrmbane, has acquired the Artes Bellator. The cover, however, will not open for him. In order to use his prize, the khan needs an appropriate sacrifice for a ritual he is convinced will unlock the tome. T o that end, he needs some adventurers to kidnap a living saint and bring her to the khan’s remote palace.


ARTES BELLATOR

The pages of Artes Bellator contain biographies of famous
warriors, weapon techniques for a wide variety of different armaments, accounts of military tactics, and monster fighting advice. The illustrations are etched with rare inks and gleam with their own inner radiance. The owner of the grimoire gradually becomes compulsive about cleaning and maintaining their arms and armor.
If attuned to it, you can use the grimoire as a spellcasting 
focus, and it functions as a spellbook for you. The spells listed below count as spells for your spellcasting class. If you are not a spellcaster and you attune to this 
grimoire, you gain three spell slots that you can use to cast the spells found within it, requiring no components. Y ou can choose either Wisdom or Charisma for your spellcasting ability. All of your spell slots are the same level, as shown below. Y ou recover all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. Only the spells listed below can be cast in this way, even if other spells are subsequently added to the book.

grimoire is on your person. Saving throws for its features equal your spell save DC.
5th level. As a bonus action, you can plunge your hand 
into the open page of the Artes Bellator and withdraw any nonmagical ranged or one-handed melee weapon of your choice. Y ou are proficient with it while you wield it. The weapon counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. Weapons created by the grimoire vanish after 1 minute or if the grimoire is not on your person or if you use this feature again.
Once you have withdrawn a weapon from the grimoire, 
you can use a bonus action to exchange it for a different weapon.

item currently held by the target, destroying it. Items or weapons incapable of being destroyed are instead flung 2d10 feet away in the direction of your choice.
Quirks of the Artes Bellator.


While attuned to the
grimoire, you occasionally experience the emotions and attitudes of its previous owners, who have left their psychic imprint upon it. While you are not compelled to act on these feelings, you might randomly experience one of the quirks presented in the Quirks of the Artes Bellator table.
GRIMOIRE OF THE INFERNAL:


KYLINDROS DAEMONIUM
This scepter-like grimoire resembles an octagonal metal cylinder set atop a skin-wrapped handle. Each of the five-inch-tall facets of the cylinder is engraved with disturbing imagery of fiendish creatures. The top of the scepter is fashioned to resemble multiple horned demon skulls. A metal ring allows one facet to be pulled, extending or retracting a coiled length of magical vellum from the interior of the cylinder. 
Ages ago, famed mercenary Captain Hadean T ath 
commanded a small but fanatically loyal band called the Bright Sabers. T ogether they defeated the vicious vampire guild, drove off the mighty blue dragon Fralnarias, and delved to the heart of the Endless Dungeon. Though each member of his band was powerful individually, their real power came from the bonds of friendship and family between them. 
As he grew older, Hadean grew afraid. Not for 
himself but for his Sabers. He could not keep them from adventuring, for to do so would destroy them faster than any foe. But still, he searched for a way to keep them safe. While traveling, he rescued a strange old hermit and as a reward was offered a priceless treasure, a magical scepter. Using the scepter, Hadean turned the tides of fate again and again, keeping his Sabers safe. Hadean’s Scepter became almost as famous as the captain himself.
However, Hadean had been betrayed.The old hermit was an elder demon, and each time 
Hadean used the scepter, he drained a year of life from his men. He watched them fall one by one, and using the 
118
DEEP MAGIC VOLUME 2scepter only accelerated the dying. By the time Hadean 
realized the truth and purged the scepter of the demon’s influence, he was the only Bright Saber left alive. Some say Hadean surrendered the scepter to a holy monastery, others claim he threw it into the sea. Most accounts agree, the last time anyone saw Captain Hadean, he pledged to journey to the dark realms and avenge himself on the demon who so fooled him.


Grimoire Adventure Hooks
The grimoire can act as potent reward for characters or serve as a plot device in adventures. Here are several hooks to utilize it in a campaign.
Grand Contest. A great tournament is about to begin in 
the capital city, with the Kylindros Daemonium on offer as the grand prize. T o win, the characters must battle their way through combat, skill challenges, intellectual puzzles, and even social conflicts. Standing against them are adventurers, mercenaries, demon-worshiping cults, and orders of holy paladins. No problem, right?
Prisoner Within. 
One of the characters, having found 
and attuned to the Kylindros Daemonium, is plagued with dreams in which a demon lord claims to be trapped within the scepter. With fiends attracted to the scepter and dogging the character’s steps, the only way to purge the scepter of its demonic prisoner is to journey to the site of the Bright Saber’s last battle and undergo a dangerous ritual.
To Battle the Sabers. Captain Hadean and the Bright 
Sabers have returned. Unfortunately, Madame Resba, a powerful hag, has reanimated them as fiendish undead. The Sabers revisit the sites of their ancient victories, undoing all their past triumphs by causing death and destruction. Defeating the Sabers proves short-lived as they rise again, more powerful than before. The only way to stop the threat is to find Madame Resba and put an end to her forever.


KYLINDROS DAEMONIUM
Wondrous Item, Fabled (5th-Level and Higher Properties Require Attunement by a Spellcaster)
Using the metal ring, the wielder can disconnect one 
facet of the scepter, unrolling a long scroll of magical vellum attached to the inside of the removed facet. Made of specially prepared humanoid skin, the scroll holds glyphs inscribed in blood and illustrations of demonic rites. An enchanted mechanism within the cylinder allows the scroll to smoothly expand or retract. The owner of the Kylindros Daemonium gradually only respects those who demonstrate strength and power and becomes more obsessed with striking bargains. 
If attuned to it, you can use the grimoire as a 
spellcasting focus, and it functions as a spellbook for you. The spells listed below count as spells for your spellcasting class. While this grimoire is in your possession, you know Infernal and Abyssal, and you have advantage on Wisdom (Persuasion) checks while conversing with fiends.
When found, the book contains the following spells.

5th level. Y ou have resistance to radiant damage. In 
addition, when a creature within 60 feet that you can see declares an attack against you or an ally, you can use your reaction to force the target to make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the target has disadvantage on the triggering attacks.
If you expend a spell slot of 3rd level or higher when you 
use this reaction, the effect on the target lasts until the end of the target’s next turn. 
9th level. Y ou have advantage on saving throws against 
spells. In addition, when a creature you can see casts a spell requiring a saving throw, you can use your reaction to force the caster to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target fumbles the casting, and any target of that spell has advantage on its saving throw.

6 Y ou believe that you are actually a demon somehow born as a mortal.
7 Y ou delight in taking each and every opportunity to sow chaos or discord.
8 Y ou yearn for the glory of combat and the thrill of hunting other creatures.If you expend a spell slot of 4th level or higher when you

a failed saving throw.
13th level. Y ou are immune to radiant damage. In 
addition, when a creature you can see within 60 feet (including yourself) takes damage from an attack, you can use your reaction to wreathe the attacker with grasping claws of infernal flames. These hellfire claws then leap from that target to an additional number of targets you can see equal to your proficiency bonus, each of which must be within 30 feet of the first target.
A target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a 
failed save, it takes 2d6 fire damage and 1d6 necrotic damage and is restrained until the beginning of your next turn. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage and is not restrained.
If you expend a spell slot of 6th level or higher when you 
use this reaction, the damage increases by 2d6 fire and 1d6 necrotic for every spell slot above 5th. 
17th level. While holding this scepter, if you fail a saving 
throw, you can choose to succeed. Once triggered, this property can’t be triggered again until the next dawn. In addition, when a creature you can see casts a spell or moves within 10 feet of your position, you can use your reaction to magically teleport the target. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw or be magically teleported up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space on the ground that you can see.
If you expend a spell slot of 7th level or higher when you 
use this reaction, a target that fails the saving throw also takes 12d6 + 40 force damage after being teleported.

THE AOSDA HYMNAL
Intricate and unsettling designs decorate the cover of this 
palm -sized belt tome. An ancient iron chain attaches to the base 
of the book’s spine, allowing it to hang inverted at thigh height, 
while latches of the same material secure the cover. Hidden 
among the designs covering the grimoire, alien eyes occasionally open and close.


The elder things lurking beyond the void seek to corrupt
and control the mortal world. There are countless tales about the touch of such beings for those who know where 
to look. One such is the influence of the Aosda Hymnal.


The story of this grimoire begins some centuries ago with
Otford Durrig, a dwarven poet of middling talent. After a disastrous performance of his epic romance, Upon A Mire’s Heap Go I, Otford lost his position in the court of 
his patron and was driven from the town by shame and 
ridicule. Since he was by no means an outdoorsman, 
Otford was soon lost in the wilderness. Shivering, hungry, and furious, his diatribe of his perceived injustices was interrupted by the nearby impact of a falling star. In a smoking crater, Otford found a curious book with strange words that seemed to resonate within his mind. 
When Otford reappeared in society, he mesmerized 
audiences, quickly earning accolades and wealthy patrons. Though his verse was still execrable, his poems were peppered with the strange words from the book, which  he took to calling the Aosda Hymnal. Perhaps Otford’s rise to fame, riches, and power would have gone on unabated if he hadn’t chosen to perform for the Monastery of the Insightful Ear, an order of monks who magically silenced themselves.
Though Otford’s end was not recorded, the histories 
record that the monastery was later razed to the ground during a series of gnoll raids. Perhaps the grimoire was taken as a prize of war or claimed by looters, rooting through the ruins of the monastery. Many generations of mages and bards have carried the Aosda Hymnal, the use of its fell words channeling the eldritch influence of the elder things.

DEEP MAGIC VOLUME 2Grimoire Adventure Hooks


The grimoire can act as potent reward for characters
or serve as a plot device in adventures. Here are several hooks to utilize it in a campaign.
Birthright/Deathright. One of the characters is 
bequeathed an ancient book, the Aosda Hymnal, and becomes the target of two different cults. The Hand of Mercy believes the characters are too corrupt to be trusted with the magics in the grimoire. The Ossified T ruth is obsessed with killing the characters to punish them for defiling the grimoire. Can the characters master the Aosda Hymnal before the cults find them?
Lamentation Village. Eager for a brief respite, the 
characters stop in a sleepy village led by a charismatic cleric who worships the Aosda Hymnal. The characters soon discover the strange inhabitants want far more than to offer them food and rest as, one by one, their deepest fears, failures, and foes come to life all around them. 
Sing a Song of Six. A local opera house is the site of a 
gruesome murder, and signs point toward three pairs of performers newly arrived in the city. T racking the culprits, the characters learn each of the pairs possesses a powerful magical word and a grudge against various nobles. Stopping the murderers proves to only be half of the task, for where did they get the words of power from?


AOSDA HYMNAL
Wondrous Item, Fabled (5th-Level and Higher Properties Require Attunement by a Spellcaster)


The iron chain of this belt or girdle tome allows the
grimoire to hang at the thigh, ready to be picked up and read. Within, the ancient pages seem impossibly thin yet magically resist damage. The grimoire is organized in the manner of a choir book, each page displaying notations on forgotten and powerful words that originated with the elder beings beyond the void. The owner of the Aosda Hymnal gradually becomes skeptical and wary, developing a fascination with codes, word puzzles, and names.
If attuned to it, you can use the grimoire as a 
spellcasting focus, and it functions as a spellbook for you. The spells listed below count as spells for your spellcasting class. Moreover, while this tome is in your possession, you can use an action to cast the word of unmaking spell (see Chapter 5) from it at will.
When found, the book contains the following spells. 
Spells marked with an asterisk (*) appear in Chapter 5:
1st level: broken charge*2nd level: clearing the field*, combust the dead*3rd level: dimensional shove*, forceful repurposing*4th level: knife of fate*, verbal assault*5th level: bone of contention*, souleater*6th level: dimensional rending*7th level: symbol8th level: desolation*9th level: black hole*Tome of Hidden Words (Requires Attunement). As your 
level increases, you gain the following benefits while the grimoire is on your person. Saving throws for its features equal your spell save DC.
5th level. As an action, you read a word of power from 
the grimoire that causes a creature to forget a bit of time. If the creature has 25 hit points or fewer, it forgets the last minute of time. When you use this property, you can choose specific events or individuals that the target will forget. The target’s mind fills in any gaps in its memory and will naturally explain away absences or illogical events, such as a message arriving when the messenger has been forgotten. The target’s memory returns after 1 week.
If you expend a spell slot of 3rd level or higher when you 
use this property, you can insert one memory into the time the target has forgotten. For example, you might suggest to a noble that you are the new guardsman he just met. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target believes the memory is real and true. This memory must somehow fit into the target’s experience during the forgotten time. If the inserted memory is too illogical, the target gains advantage on the saving throw.
Once you use this property, you must finish a short or 
long rest before you can use it again.
9th level. As an action, you read a word of power from 
the grimoire to momentarily take control of a creature’s attacks. If the creature has 50 hit points or fewer, it immediately uses its reaction to make an attack or cast a spell on a target of your choice. Y ou can command the target to use a spell if you have witnessed the target using the spell and if it has uses of that spell remaining.
Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or 
long rest before you can use it again.

the grimoire to strip away a creature’s magic. One creature 
that you can see within 60 feet is subjected to an aura of antimagic, as in the antimagic field spell. This aura moves with the creature. At the end of each of the target’s turns, it can make a Wisdom saving throw. On a success, the effect ends on the target.
Once you use this feature, you must finish a long rest 
before you can use it again.
17th level. As an action, you read a word of power from 
the grimoire to send a rippling wave of detonations to rend your foes’ very existence. Hostile creatures within 90 feet of a point you can see within 60 feet of you are affected in descending order of their current hit points (ignoring unconscious creatures).Starting with the hostile creature that has the highest 
current hit points, the first creature takes 10d10 force damage, the second target takes 9d10 force damage, and so on until there are no d10s remaining. A creature can only take damage from this property once with each use. When there are no d10s remaining or no unaffected hostile creatures in range, the effect ends.
Once you use this property, you must finish a long rest 
before you can use it again.

CHAPTER 5 SPELL DESCRIPTIONS
The new spells presented in Deep Magic 2 are detailed here. 
The spells are listed in alphabetical order. Refer to specific 
class spell lists in Chapter 4 to determine which of these spells each class can use.
 A


AEGIS OF HONOR
1st-Level Abjuration
Casting Time: 1 reaction, which you take when a 
friendly creature you can see within 30 feet of you takes 
damage from an attack
Range: 30 feet
Components: VDuration: Instantaneous 
Y ou reach out toward the friendly target, placing a brief 
barrier between the target and the target’s attacker. The damage the target takes is reduced by 1d6 + your spellcasting ability modifier. If this effect reduces the damage to 0, you can turn the damage back on the Spell Descriptions

138
DEEP MAGIC VOLUME 2attacker. Make a ranged spell attack against the attacker. 
On a hit, the attacker takes force damage equal to the amount of damage you reduced.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell 
slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage the target takes is reduced by an additional 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.


AFFLICT LINE
9th-Level Necromancy (Ritual)
Casting Time: 1 minute
Range: 1 mileComponents: V , S, M (a statuette carved in the likeness 
of the victim worth at least 1,250 gp)
Duration: Permanent; one generation


Y ou invoke the darkest curses upon your victim and its
descendants. This spell doesn’t require that you have a clear path to your target, only that your target is within range. The target must make a successful Wisdom saving throw or be cursed until the magic is dispelled. While cursed, the victim has disadvantage on ability checks and saving throws made with the ability score that you used when you cast the spell. In addition, the target’s firstborn offspring is also targeted by the curse. That individual is allowed a saving throw of its own if it is currently alive, or it makes one upon its birth if it is not yet born when the spell is cast. If the target’s firstborn has already died, the curse passes to the target’s next eldest offspring.
Ritual Focus. If you expend your ritual focus, the curse 
becomes hereditary, passing from firstborn to firstborn for the entire length of the family’s lineage until one of them successfully saves against the curse and throws off your dark magic.
AMBUSHER’S REGRET
1st-level Evocation
Casting Time: 1 reaction, which you take when you are 
hit by a ranged attack from an attacker you can’t see
Range: 120 feet
Components: SDuration: 1 round


Y ou release an arcane arrow that traces the path of the
triggering attack back to your unseen attacker, provided the attacker is in range. That creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be outlined in light until the end of your next turn. While outlined in light, the creature sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius, any attack roll against it is made with advantage if the attacker can see the creature, and the creature can’t benefit from being invisible.AMPLIFY SOUND
1st-Level Divination 
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 120 feet
Components: S, M (a small cup and bit of string)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute


Y ou turn your attention to a point you can see within
range, creating an invisible sensor in that location. For the 
duration of the spell, you hear sounds from that point as if 
you were in its space.


If the space where the point is located is subjected
to thunder damage, you take the thunder damage as if 
you were in the space, but you don’t suffer other effects 
associated with that thunder damage. For example, if a 
creature casts the thunderwave spell, and the point you 
chose is within the spell’s area, you take thunder damage 
as if you failed the saving throw, but you aren’t pushed.  
A creature that can see the sensor (such as a creature 
benefiting from see invisibility or truesight) sees a thin, luminous string winding from the sensor to you.


ANNEAL
1st-Level Transmutation 
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: T ouchComponents: V , S, M (a pinch of iron filings)
Duration: 1 hour
Y ou touch a nonmagical melee weapon, temporarily 
making it stronger, sharper, and more destructive. Until 
the spell ends, the weapon deals an extra 1d6 damage of its 
type on a hit. This spell doesn’t make the weapon magical. 
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a slot of 
3rd level or higher, you can target one additional weapon 
within your reach for each slot level above 2nd.
APPARITION’S INVITATION
3rd-Level Illusion
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: 60 feet
Components: V,  S
Duration: Concentration up to 1 minute


Y ou conjure an illusory apparition in an unoccupied
space within range. The shape of the apparition changes 
in the minds of creatures who behold it, appearing as a 
comforting something or someone that beckons to the 
creature. When you cast this spell, choose up to three 
creatures within range that can see the apparition. Each 
target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be 
charmed by the apparition until this spell ends. While 
charmed, a target must take the Dash action and move 
toward the apparition by the safest available route on 
139
CHAPTER 5 SPELL DESCRIPTIONSeach of its turns, unless there is nowhere to move. If the 
target ends its turn within 5 feet of the apparition, the target takes 2d10 psychic damage, and the spell ends for that target.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell 
slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 3rd.


AQUEOUS ARENA
2nd-Level Transmutation 
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: 90 feetComponents: V , S, M (a drop of water)Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Y ou alter the air in a 15-foot-radius, 30-foot-high cylinder 
centered on a point you can see within range. Within the cylinder, air becomes viscous and takes on some of the properties of water. Creatures inside the cylinder move and fight as if underwater, and objects that aren’t being worn or carried float or sink to the top or bottom of the cylinder as if underwater. Creatures can move vertically within the cylinder as if swimming in water. 
Though the cylinder acts like water, it is still air. 
Creatures and objects within the cylinder don’t have resistance to fire damage from being fully immersed in water, and creatures that breathe air can breathe normally while inside the cylinder. This spell has no effect if cast on a point underwater, and any part of the cylinder that is underwater has no special effect.
When the spell ends, any creature above the ground that 
doesn’t have a flying speed falls, taking falling damage as normal.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell 
slot of 4th level or higher, the cylinder’s radius increases by 5 feet and its height increases by 10 feet for each slot level above 3rd.


ARCANE SPARKLER
Evocation Cantrip 
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feetComponents: V,  SDuration: Instantaneous


Y ou fling a condensed ball of colorful lights and sounds at
a creature you can see within range. Make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the target takes 1d6 thunder damage, and the target is distracted by the lights and sounds until the start of your next turn. While distracted, a creature must make a Constitution saving throw whenever it casts a spell that requires concentration. On a failed save, the creature can’t concentrate on that spell, losing concentration on it at the start of your next turn. The spell’s damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th 
level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).


ARROW DOOR
3rd-Level Conjuration 
Casting Time: 1 reaction, which you take when you or 
a creature you can see within 120 feet of you fires an 
arrow, bolt, or other projectile from a ranged weapon
Range: 120 feet
Components: V,  SDuration: 1 minute
When you cast this spell, two shimmering portals appear: 
one green portal in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you and one purple portal in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the arrow’s target. Any creature can step through the green portal and appear in the purple portal’s space. The portals are one-way. A creature that steps into the purple portal’s space feels a tingling chill but is otherwise unaffected by this spell. The portals last for the duration or until a creature steps through the green portal.


ARROW OF ASH
5th-Level Evocation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 120 feetComponents: V,  SDuration: Instantaneous


Y ou create and launch a missile of hardened ash which
travels toward one creature you can see within range. Make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the target takes 3d6 force damage and 3d6 fire damage. When it reaches the target, the ash arrow bursts into a 30-foot-radius sphere of ash centered on the target, regardless if the attack hits the target. The cloud of ash spreads around corners, its area is heavily obscured, and it lasts for 1 minute.


When a creature enters the cloud for the first time on a
turn or starts its turn there, that creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become poisoned until the start of its next turn. A moderate wind (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses the cloud after 4 rounds. A strong wind (at least 20 miles per hour) disperses it after 1 round.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell 
slot of 6th level or higher, the fire damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 5th.
140
DEEP MAGIC VOLUME 2ASHEN LASHES
1st-Level Evocation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 90 feet
Components: V,  S
Duration: 1 minute


Y ou create two tendrils of magical ash to appear in
unoccupied spaces within range. The tendrils can’t 
be targeted with attacks and are immune to damage.


When you cast this spell and as a bonus action on your
subsequent turns, you can command one or more of the 
tendrils to attack a creature within 10 feet of it. Make a 
melee spell attack for each tendril using your spellcasting 
ability modifier. On a hit, a tendril deals 1d4 fire damage 
to the target.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 
spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can creature one additional tendril for each slot level above 1st.


AURA OF ENTROPY
4th-Level Abjuration
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self (30-foot radius)
Components: VDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes


Sickening energy radiates out from you in a
sphere with a 30-foot radius. While the spell 
lasts, the sphere remains centered on you 
and moves with you. Each hostile creature in the sphere has disadvantage on saving throws against becoming frightened, 
paralyzed, poisoned, or stunned. 
Creatures in the sphere can’t gain 
temporary hit points, and any effect that restores hit points to a creature within the sphere has those hit points reduced 
by an amount equal to your spellcasting 
ability modifier (minimum of 1).


AURA OF FILTH
4th-Level Necromancy
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self (30-foot-radius)
Components: V
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Putrefying energy radiates in a 30-foot radius around you. 
Each creature in the aura, including you, has disadvantage 
on saving throws against poison and disease and on death 
saving throws. In addition, each creature in the aura can’t 
be cured of a disease or poison, except by means of a heal 
or wish spell.Dying or decaying material within the aura, such 
as corpses, picked flowers, or food, rapidly putrefy, 
decaying an additional day for each round it is in the aura. This effect increases the amount of time a corpse has been dead, counting against the time limit of spells such as raise dead.


AZALEA SKIN
1st-Level Transmutation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: SelfComponents: V , S, M (an azalea vine)Duration: 1 minute
Dozens of azaleas blossom on your skin. Until this spell 
ends, if a creature hits you with an attack while within 5 feet of you, it takes 1d6 poison damage. If a creature within 5 feet of you scores a critical hit against you, the azaleas release a burst of poisonous pollen. Each creature within 5 feet of you must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 2d6 poison damage and be poisoned until the end of its next turn. The spell then ends. 

141
CHAPTER 5 SPELL DESCRIPTIONSAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell 
slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 
for every two slot levels above 1st.B
BABA’S PINCUSHION
2nd-Level Conjuration 
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 90 feetComponents: V , S, M (a handful of thorny stems or a set 
of forks, pins, or darts)
Duration: Instantaneous


Y ou conjure a torrent of serrated darts that fly toward a
target within range, puncturing and pinning it. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 5d4 piercing damage and is pinned to the ground or another surface within 5 feet of the target, such as a wall, tree, or similar, for 1 minute.


While pinned to the ground or to a surface heavier than
it, the target is restrained. The restrained target can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. If it succeeds, it is no longer restrained. 
While pinned to a surface that is lighter than it, such as 
a chair or saddle, the target’s speed is halved, but it isn’t restrained. The target can use an action to extricate itself from such a surface.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell 
slot of 3rd or higher, the damage increases by 1d4 for each slot level above 2nd.
BALO’S BOLSTER DEAD
3rd-Level Necromancy 
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: SelfComponents: V , S, M (a femur engraved with gold runes 
worth 50 gold)
Duration: Instantaneous
Necrotic energy flows out from you, bolstering your 
Undead allies. Each friendly Undead within 30 feet of you gains temporary hit points equal to twice your spellcasting ability modifier for 8 hours. If you expend your life force when you cast this spell, you can increase the temporary hit points each target gains. Expend and roll a number of Hit Dice of your choice up to half your maximum Hit Dice. Each target of this spell increases the temporary hit points it gains by that amount.
Hit Dice spent in this way can’t be used to regain hit 
points during a short rest. Y ou regain spent Hit Dice as normal.BARK BULWARK
4th-Level Abjuration 
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: 5 feet
Components: V , S, M (a piece of bark)
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes


A nonmagical wall of bark erupts from the ground to
protect you and your allies. Choose a space in front of 
or behind you. The wall forms in that space, extending 
15 feet out from that space along the ground in opposite 
directions for a total length of 30 feet. The wall is 5 feet 
high, 6 inches thick, opaque, and provides three-quarters 
cover to creatures behind it. 
If the wall cuts through a creature’s space when it 
appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your choice). The wall can’t otherwise occupy the same 
space as a creature or object. The wall must be vertical and 
must rest on a firm foundation, such as the ground, the 
floor of a building, the deck of a ship, or similar.


The wall is an object made of bark that can be damaged
and thus breached. Each 10-foot section of the wall has AC 15, 100 hit points, and vulnerability to fire damage. Reducing a section to 0 hit points destroys it.


If you maintain your concentration on this spell for its
whole duration, the wall becomes permanent and can’t be dispelled. Otherwise, the wall disappears when the spell ends.

you take half the triggering damage. On a critical hit, the target takes all the triggering damage, and you take none. After the attack, regardless if it hits or misses, you gain

difficult terrain.BLACK WELL
6th-Level Necromancy
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 300 feet
Components: V,  S
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Y ou summon a seething sphere of dark energy 5 feet 
in diameter at a point within range. The sphere pulls 
creatures toward it and devours the life force of those 
it envelops. Every creature other than you that starts 
its turn within 90 feet of the black well must make a 
successful Strength saving throw or be pulled 50 feet 
toward the well. A creature pulled into the well takes 
6d8 necrotic damage and is stunned; a successful


Constitution saving throw halves the damage and causes
the creature to become incapacitated. A creature that 
starts its turn inside the well also makes a Constitution 
saving throw; the creature is stunned on a failed save or 
incapacitated on a success. An incapacitated creature that leaves the well recovers immediately and can take actions and reactions on that turn. 
A creature takes damage only upon entering the well—
it takes no additional damage for remaining there—but 
if it leaves the well and is pulled back in again, it takes 
damage again. A total of nine Medium creatures, three 
Large creatures, or one Huge creature can be inside the well’s other-dimensional space at one time. When the spell’s duration ends, all creatures inside it tumble out in a 
heap, landing prone.

body. The blade is a magical weapon, uses your spell attack 
bonus when you attack with it, and deals 1d6 slashing 
damage on a hit. Y ou are considered proficient with the 
blade. As a bonus action, you can slide the blade back 
into your body to conceal it. When the duration ends, the

If the target is already suffering from a disease or poison that allows for repeated saving throws to remove the effect, it can immediately make a new saving throw against the effect with advantage. Regardless if this new save succeeds or fails, a target that is already suffering from a disease or the poisoned condition can’t be affected by this spell again until it finishes a long rest.

Y ou cause discord in up to eight creatures you can see
within range. Each target must be within 30 feet of at least one other target. The targets must share a language or the spell fails. Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, a target begins bickering and arguing with other affected targets on topics relevant to the targets. For example, religious creatures might argue over doctrine, while warriors might argue over the most efficient fighting stances or ways of dispatching foes. For the duration, each affected creature’s speed is halved, and it spends each of its turns arguing with another affected creature.
146
DEEP MAGIC VOLUME 2An arguing creature can repeat the saving throw at the 
end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a

from that explosion to a second target point you can see exactly 40 feet from the first explosion.

Then the flame jumps instantly again to a third target point, also within your line of sight and exactly 40 feet from the second explosion, where it detonates for the final time with identical results.
Note that for the second and third bursts, the flame 
jumps exactly 40 feet—never more, never less—and if any part of a burst area overlaps the area of a previous burst, the burst fails to happen and the spell ends immediately.

An object the same size or smaller than the thrower is thrown up to 30 feet in a random direction. A creature the same size as the thrower is thrown up to 15 feet in a random direction and knocked prone.

creature if the bubble is reduced to 0 hit points. A creature

The bubble is weightless and just large enough to
contain the creature inside of it. When the enclosed 
creature moves, the bubble moves with it. If the bubble 
was created in an area with air, the bubble contains enough air for a breathing creature contained within it to breathe for the duration of the spell. If the bubble was 
created in an area of water, the bubble contains enough 
water for a water-breathing creature to breathe for the 
duration of the spell.

Y ou cause the vital organs of a creature you can see within
range to swell and burst inside its body. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 6d10 necrotic damage and suffers one of the following effects of your choice.

BURY THE DEAD
3rd-Level Abjuration 
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feetComponents: 
V , S, M (a pinch of grave dirt from a coffin)

149
CHAPTER 5 SPELL DESCRIPTIONSstone that is large enough to contain the target’s entire 
body and that is at least 6 feet deep, or the spell fails.
The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On 
a successful save, the target is restrained by earth or stone until the end of its next turn. On a failed save, the target is dragged up to 6 feet under the surface and is incapacitated and restrained until the spell ends. The displaced earth or stone becomes a mound on the surface in the space the target previously occupied. 
When the spell ends, the target is harmlessly pushed 
to the surface in the space it previously occupied or the nearest unoccupied space. If you concentrate on this spell for the full duration, the target remains restrained underground until it or another creature digs it out.


BUSY BEE
3rd-Level Conjuration 
Casting Time: 1 minute
Range: Self
Components: V , S, M (tiny carving of a bee worth 50 gp)Duration: 1 hour


Y ou summon a spirit that animates the bee carving for
up to 8 hours, which attaches to your clothing, sits on your equipment, or otherwise remains within 1 foot of you. If the bee is ever more than 1 foot away from you, this spell ends. 
When you lose concentration on a spell of 3rd level 
or lower, the spirit animating the bee takes over and maintains concentration on that spell until that spell ends or this spell ends, whichever has a shorter duration. While the spirit is maintaining concentration on a spell, you can’t cast a spell that requires concentration.
The spirit can’t be attacked or destroyed, and its 
concentration can’t be interrupted. Y ou can dismiss this spell at any time (no action required), and a dispel magic spell cast on the bee, if successful, ends this spell. 
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell 
slot of 4th level or higher, the spirit can concentrate on spells with a spell level up to the spell slot you used, and the duration increases by 1 hour for each slot level  above 3rd.


BY THE LIGHT OF THE MOON
2nd-Level Divination 
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self (30-foot radius)Components: V,  SDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
The area within 30 feet of you becomes bathed in 
magical moonlight. In addition to providing dim light, it highlights objects and locations that are hidden or that hold a useful clue. Until the spell ends, all Wisdom (Perception) and Intelligence (Investigation) checks made in the area are made with advantage.


BY THE LIGHT OF THE WATCHFUL MOON
4th-Level Divination
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 90 feet
Components: V,  SDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Regardless of the time of day or your location, you 
command the watchful gaze of the moon to illuminate threats to you and your allies. Shafts of bright moonlight, each 5 feet wide, shine down from the sky (or from the ceiling if you are indoors), illuminating all spaces within range that contain threats, whether they are enemies, traps, or hidden hazards. An enemy creature that makes a successful Charisma saving throw resists the effect and is not picked out by the moon’s glow.
The glow does not make invisible creatures visible, but 
it does indicate an invisible creature’s general location (somewhere within the 5-foot beam). The light continues to illuminate any target that moves, but a target that moves out of the spell’s area is no longer illuminated. A threat that enters the area after the spell is cast is not subject to the spell’s effect.

CALL SHADOW MASTIFF
3rd-Level Conjuration
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V , S, M (a dog’s tooth)Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute


Y ou tap into the power of the Plane of Shadow and
conjure a large dog made of pure shadow in an unoccupied space you can see within range. The shadow mastiff disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.
The mastiff is friendly to you and your companions. 
Roll initiative for the mastiff, which has its own turns. It obeys verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required by you). If you don’t issue any commands to it, the mastiff defends itself from hostile creatures, but otherwise takes no actions.
The GM has the shadow mastiff ’s statistics, using a dire 
wolf, except it is a Monstrosity, it doubles its proficiency bonus when making Dexterity (Stealth) checks, and it has the Bay action and the Shadow Stealth bonus action, both of which are described below:
150
DEEP MAGIC VOLUME 2Bay. The shadow mastiff uses an action to release a 
terrifying howl. Each creature within a 30-foot cone of the 
mastiff must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. While frightened, a creature must take the Dash action and move away from the mastiff by the safest available route on each of its turns, unless there is nowhere to move. A frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature’s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the Bay of shadow mastiffs for the next 24 hours.
Shadow Stealth. As a bonus action while in dim light or 
darkness, the mastiff takes the Hide action.

caustic substance)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Y ou create either a rectangular pool of acid 50 feet long, 
10 feet wide, and 5 feet deep, or a circular pool of acid 20 feet in diameter and 3 feet deep, in an open space you can see within range.

CECILY’S STORMSHOT


Evocation Cantrip
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 90 feet
Components: V,  SDuration: Instantaneous


Y ou channel the primal energy of storms into your
free hand or spellcasting focus before releasing an instantaneous blast of lightning at a creature you can see within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 lightning damage. If the target is wearing armor or carrying a weapon made of metal, it instead takes 1d10 lightning damage. 
This spell’s damage increases by one die when you reach 
5th level (2d8 or 2d10), 11th level (3d8 or 3d10), and 17th level (4d8 and 4d10). CELEBRATION
7th-Level Enchantment (Ritual)
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 90 feet
Components: V , S, M (a small party favor)
Duration: 1 hour
Y ou create a 30-foot-radius area around a point that you 
choose within range. An intelligent creature that enters 
the area or starts its turn there must make a Wisdom 
saving throw. On a failed save, the creature starts to 
engage in celebratory revelry: drinking, singing, laughing, 
and dancing. Affected creatures are reluctant to leave 
the area until the spell ends, preferring to continue the 
festivities. They forsake appointments, cease caring 
about their woes, and generally behave in a cordial 
(if not hedonistic) manner. This preoccupation with 
merrymaking occurs regardless of an affected creature’s 
agenda or alignment. Assassins procrastinate, servants 
join in the celebration rather than working, and guards abandon their posts. 
The effect ends on a creature when it is attacked, takes 
damage, or is forced to leave the area. A creature that makes a successful saving throw can enter or leave the area 
without danger of being enchanted. A creature that fails 
the saving throw and is forcibly removed from the area 
must repeat the saving throw if it returns to the area.
Ritual Focus. If you expend your ritual focus, an 
unaffected intelligent creature must make a new saving 
throw every time it starts its turn in the area, even if it has 
previously succeeded on a save against the spell.


CHAINS OF JUSTICE
3rd-Level Conjuration 
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feetComponents: V
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute


Chains erupt from a point on the ground you can see
within range. The chains cover the ground in a 20-foot radius centered on that point. For the duration, the chains 
turn the ground in the area into difficult terrain.
When a creature enters the spell’s area for the first 
time on a turn or starts its turn there, that creature must 
succeed on a Strength saving throw or be restrained by the chains until the spell ends. A creature restrained by the 
chains can use its action to make a Dexterity saving throw. 
On a success, it wriggles free of the chains.
Until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action on each 
of your subsequent turns to tighten the chains around one 
creature restrained by the chains. The target must succeed 
on a Strength saving throw or take 2d6 radiant damage 
and be knocked prone.

CHAPTER 5 SPELL DESCRIPTIONSCHAMBER OF RESTORING AMBER
4th-Level Abjuration 
Casting Time: 1 minute
Range: Self (15-foot-radius hemisphere)
Components: V , S, M (a piece of amber worth at least  
50 gp)
Duration: 10 minutes
A 15-foot-radius immobile dome of amber springs into 
existence around and above you and remains stationary  
for the duration. The spell ends if you leave the area.


The amber can fit up to twelve Medium or smaller
creatures inside of it. The spell fails if its area includes 
a larger creature or more than twelve creatures. Only 
creatures you designate can enter the dome through an 
entrance in one of the dome’s walls. All other creatures are 
barred from entering the amber dome. Spells and other 
magical effects can’t extend through the amber or be cast 
through it. The atmosphere inside the amber is comfortable 
and dry, regardless of the weather outside. The interior is dimly lit in a soft, amber glow. The amber is opaque from the outside, but it is transparent from the inside.


A creature that remains in the amber for its full duration
gains the benefits of a short rest, and it can’t be affected by 
this spell again until it finishes a long rest.


CHAOTIC CONTRITION
3rd-Level Enchantment
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: VDuration: 1 minute


Y ou fill one creature you can see within range with
profound remorse and guilt. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be incapacitated until the end of 
its next turn. When the condition ends on the target, the 
nearest hostile creature within 30 feet of the first target 
must make the saving throw, becoming incapacitated until the end of its next turn on a failed save. If more than one creature qualifies, you break the tie and choose which of those creatures becomes the spell’s next target.


This effect continues to hop from one creature to the
next in this way until a creature succeeds on the saving throw or no valid targets are within range. A creature can’t become the target of this effect more than once per casting of this spell. CHAOTIC FLOWERFALL 
9th-Level Conjuration 
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 150 feet
Components: V , S, M (a posy of flowers)

A shower of flowers falls across the ground at ten different
points you can see within range. The flowers fall in 10-foot 
cubes centered on each point, and each cube must be 
contiguous with at least one other cube. Each friendly 
creature in a cube chooses one of the following when the 
flowers appear—it regains 10d6 hit points or it is cured 
of all diseases and all the following conditions: blinded, 
charmed, deafened, paralyzed, petrified, and poisoned.


Each hostile creature in a cube must make a Dexterity
saving throw, taking 10d10 necrotic damage on a failed 
save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A 
creature in the area of more than one cube of falling 
flowers is affected only once.


CHARM OF GREAT FONDNESS
2nd-Level Enchantment
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 30 feet
Components: V,  SDuration: 1 hour


Y ou attempt to charm a humanoid you can see within
range. It makes a Wisdom saving throw, with advantage if you or your companions are fighting it or if you are not 
the same species as the target. If the saving throw fails, the 
targeted humanoid becomes quite fond of you until the 
duration expires or until you or any of your companions do anything harmful to it. The charmed creature regards you as a potential romantic partner and seeks to attract 
you in whatever manner is most appropriate to it. It might 
tell you jokes or clown around, give you a (modest) gift, 
flirt gently, flex its muscles and demonstrate its athletic prowess, or compose a love poem to you. When the spell ends, the creature knows it was charmed by you.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell 
slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional 
creature for each slot level above 2nd. The creatures must 
be within 30 feet of each other when you target them. If 
two or more creatures fail their saving throws, they fall to 
bickering between themselves over who is more worthy 
of your affection.

This spell functions as charm person but with a longer
duration. The target of the spell remains charmed for 
one day per level you’ve attained in your spellcasting

expended Hit Dice (minimum 1), removes half its levels 
of exhaustion (minimum 1), and gains all the benefits of finishing a short rest.


Creatures affected by this spell must succeed on a

Duration: 1 hour
Y ou ensorcel a Medium vehicle powered by wind, 
increasing its speed by 10 feet or 1 mile per hour 
(whichever is most appropriate for the vehicle) for the

the vehicle can use an action to turn the vehicle up to 90 
degrees, quickly changing the vehicle’s direction. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell 
slot of 3rd level or higher, the duration increases by 1

Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: Self (30-foot cone)
Components: V , S, M (a cracked tourmaline)Duration: Instantaneous
Y ou utter, shout, or sing a short verse to damage and 
deafen your enemies. A cacophonous clap of thunder slams out from you in a 30-foot cone that is audible out to 300 feet. Each creature in the cone must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 4d6 thunder damage and is deafened until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half the damage and isn’t deafened. 
When you cast this spell, up to four friendly creatures 
within 30 feet of you that can see you can each use a reaction to join the chorus with a clash of weapon against shield, a ringing shout, or other loud noise. For each creature that joins the chorus, the spell’s damage increases by 1d6, and the cone’s size increases by 5 feet.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell 
slot of 4th level or higher, the primary damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.


CHRYSALIS
5th-Level Transmutation 
Casting Time: 1 reaction, which you take when a 
friendly creature you can see within 60 feet of you is 
reduced to 0 hit points
Range: 60 feet
Components: V , S, M (a caterpillar cocoon)Duration: 1 round


A protective chrysalis surrounds a creature you can
see within range as it is reduced to 0 hit points. While protected in this way, the target is still unconscious from being reduced to 0 hit points, but unlike when a creature is normally unconscious, attacks from attackers within 5 feet aren’t automatically critical hits. In addition, the target has three-quarters cover and isn’t prone while protected. The target must make applicable death saving throws, as normal. 
The chrysalis has hit points equal to 5d8 + three times 
your spellcasting ability modifier. When the protected target would take damage, the chrysalis takes the damage instead. The chrysalis is destroyed when it has 0 hit points. 
If the chrysalis remains at the end of your next turn, 
the target regains hit points equal to the chrysalis’s remaining hit points, then the chrysalis crumbles to dust and is destroyed. As the chrysalis crumbles, spectral wings manifest on the target’s back, and the target gains a flying speed of 30 feet for 1 minute.

raking beastly claws appears on the target as a tattoo, embroidery, painted symbol, or similar decorative embellishment for the duration. The next time the target is hit with a melee attack by an attacker within 5 feet of it before this spell ends, the attacker takes 1d8 slashing damage as the claws rise up and slash at the attacker. The claws then disappear and the spell ends.
This spell’s damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th 
level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).


CLAWS OF DARKNESS

CLEARING THE FIELD
2nd-Level Transmutation (Ritual)
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 40 feet
Components: V,  SDuration: 1 hour
With a harsh word and a vicious chopping motion, you 
cause every tree, shrub, and stump within 40 feet of you to sink into the ground, leaving the vacated area clear of plant life that might otherwise hamper movement or obscure sight. Overgrown areas that counted as difficult terrain become clear ground and no longer hamper movement. The original plant life instantly rises from the ground again when the spell ends or is dispelled. Plant creatures are not affected by clearing the field.
Ritual Focus. If you expend your ritual focus, each Plant 
creature in the area must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or decrease in size as if it failed the saving throw against the reduce effect of the enlarge/reduce spell.

When the wall appears, each creature within its area 
must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, 
a creature is covered in a sticky, heavy film of shadow 
until the spell ends. A creature covered in the shadowy 
film is blinded, takes a −1 penalty to its AC, and can’t 
benefit from being invisible. Furthermore, the first time a 
creature enters the wall or ends its turn there, the creature 
must make the Dexterity saving throw.


A creature covered in the shadowy film can take an
action to wipe off the film, ending the effect on itself.


CLOAK OF SHADOW

As a bonus action, you can command your cloak to 
leave your body, becoming a swarm of insects, and enter the space of an adjacent foe. The swarm attacks that foe 
(the GM has the swarm’s statistics) until you use a bonus 
action to command it to return to you, the foe moves

damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a 
successful one. 
A body can be targeted by this spell only once. If the 
target body was dead for more than one week, the body is completely destroyed, and the creature can be restored to 
life only by means of a true resurrection or a wish spell.

Range: 60 feetComponents: V,  SDuration: 1 minute
Y ou create a 20-foot-radius sphere of mist centered on a 
point within range. The sphere spreads around corners, 
and its area is heavily obscured. It lasts for the duration or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it. 
If a creature within the mist takes lightning damage, 
the mist immediately disperses, ending this spell, and the lightning damage spreads to other creatures in the mist. Each creature within the mist, other than the creature that took the lightning damage, must make a Constitution 
saving throw, taking the same amount of lightning 
damage that the triggering creature took on a failed save, 
or half as much damage on a successful one.

Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 30 feet
Components: V , S, M (a broken compass)
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes


This spell befuddles the minds of up to six creatures
that you can see within range, causing the creatures to 
see images of shifting terrain. Each target that fails an


Intelligence saving throw is reduced to half speed until the
spell ends because of confusion over its surroundings, and 
it makes ranged attack rolls with disadvantage.Affected creatures also find it impossible to keep 
track of their location. They automatically fail Wisdom (Survival) checks to avoid getting lost. Whenever an affected creature must choose between one or more paths, it chooses at random and immediately forgets which direction it came from.


CONJURE FERRYMAN
2nd-Level Conjuration 
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 90 feetComponents: V , S, M (a couple of copper coins)Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour


When standing on a riverbank or on the shore of some
other body of water, you summon a ferry spirit and its boat, which appears in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. The spirit disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends. The spirit is friendly to you and your companions for the duration. Roll initiative for the creature, which has its own turns. It takes you and up to 1 companion per your level across the river or body of water (no action required by you) or to other locations along the same water. If you don’t issue any such commands, it defends itself from hostile creatures but otherwise takes no actions. 
If your concentration is broken, the ferry and its 
guide don’t disappear. Instead, you lose control of the conjured spirit, it becomes hostile toward you and your companions, and it might attack. An uncontrolled ferryman can’t be dismissed by you, and it disappears 1 hour after you summoned it. 
The GM has the ferry spirit’s statistics, using the 
statistics of a bearded devil. 
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell 
slot of 3rd level or higher, the boat can take you and your companions across a planar boundary into the Ethereal Plane and then exit on another body of water.

It obeys any verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required by you) as long as your commands don’t violate its alignment. If you don’t issue any commands to the giant, it defends itself from hostile creatures but otherwise take no actions. If your concentration is broken, the giant doesn’t disappear, but instead, you lose control of it: the giant becomes hostile toward you and your companions and might attack. An uncontrolled giant can’t be dismissed by you, and it disappears 1 hour after summoned. 
The GM has the giant’s statistics.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell 
slot of 7th level or higher, the challenge rating increases by 1 for each slot level above 6th.

1st-Level Conjuration
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: 60 feetComponents: V , S Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour


Y ou summon rats or ratfolk that appear in unoccupied

Roll initiative for the summoned rats as a group, which has its own turns. They obey any verbal commands that you issue to them (no action required by you), except the wererat. If you don’t issue any commands, they defend themselves from hostile creatures but otherwise take no actions. The GM has the creatures’ statistics.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using 
higher-level spell slots, you can choose one of the summoning options above, and more creatures appear: one additional creature with a 2nd-level slot or three additional creatures with a 4th-level slot. Any summoned wererats obey verbal commands.CONJURE SHADOW TITAN

Casting Time: 1 minute

when the spell ends.


The shadow titan is friendly to you and your
companions. Roll initiative for the shadow titan; it acts 
on its own turn. It obeys verbal or telepathic commands 
that you issue to it (no action required by you). If you don’t 
issue any commands to the shadow titan, it defends itself 
from hostile creatures but otherwise takes no actions.
The GM has the shadow titan’s statistics, using a stone 
giant, except its Stone Camouflage works in dim light and 
darkness rather than rocky terrain, and the rocks it throws are composed of shadow stuff and cause cold damage instead of bludgeoning damage.


CONJURE SPELLHOUND
4th-Level Conjuration
Casting Time: 1 minute
Range: 90 feet
Components: V,  S
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour
Y ou summon a spellhound, a Large hound with a 
shimmering, multihued coat, in an unoccupied space you 
can see within range. The spellhound disappears when it 
drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.


The spellhound is friendly to you and your companions
for the duration. Roll initiative for the creature, which 
has its own turns. It obeys any verbal commands that you 
issue to it (no action required by you). If you don’t issue 
any commands to the spellhound, it defends itself from hostile creatures but otherwise takes no actions. While you control the spellhound, you and your companions are immune to the spellhound’s Nullifying Howl.
If your concentration is broken, the spellhound doesn’t 
disappear. Instead, you lose control of the spellhound, it becomes hostile toward you and your companions, and it might attack. An uncontrolled spellhound can’t be dismissed by you, and it disappears 1 hour after you 
summoned it.
The GM has the spellhound’s statistics, using a 
spellhound (see T ome of Beasts 2) or a winter wolf with the 
following action:
Nullifying Howl (1/Day). The spellhound lets out a 
high-pitched, multiphonic howl to disrupt magical effects 
within 60 feet of it. Any spell of 3rd level or lower within

In addition, each spellcaster within 30 feet of the spellhound that can hear the howl must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of its next turn.

CONTAGIOUS HEALING
2nd-Level Evocation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: T ouch
Components: V,  SDuration: 1 minute


Y our touch infects a friendly creature with a magical
disease. The target regains a number of hit points equal to 1d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier. The next time the target takes damage, the disease ends on the target and infects a new friendly creature within 10 feet of the first. The new target regains hit points equal to 1d8 + your spellcasting modifier. The next time the new target takes damage, the disease ends on it and moves to another friendly creature within 10 feet of it, continuing in this manner until no valid targets are in range or the spell ends. A creature can be healed by your contagious healing only once per casting of this spell. This spell has no effect on Undead or Constructs.

DEEP MAGIC VOLUME 2CONTINGENCY BOILS
5th-Level Necromancy 
Casting Time: 10 minutes
Range: Self
Components: V , S, M (an obsidian knife infused with 
mummy dust, worth at least 1,000 gp)
Duration: 10 days
Choose a necromancy spell of 5th level or lower that 
you can cast, that has a casting time of 1 action, and 
has a range of T ouch. Y ou cast that spell—called the 
contingent spell—as part of casting contingency boils, 
expending spell slots for both, but the contingent spell 
doesn’t come into effect. The contingent spell is stored 
in a boil on your skin that is created as part of the casting 
of contingency boils. Each time you cast contingency boils, 
you create a new boil on your skin. Y our skin can contain 
a number of contingent spells within boils equal to your 
spellcasting ability modifier. For each boil on your skin, 
your Charisma score is reduced by 2 until you no longer have any boils from this spell on your skin. 
When a creature within 5 feet of you deals 
damage to you with a weapon attack, you can use your reaction 
to rupture a boil. The 
contingent spell takes 
effect immediately after the rupture, targeting the attacker. That boil 
and that instance of the 
contingency boils spell then ends.


If you are affected by lesser
restoration, greater restoration, 
or a similar effect that removes 
diseases (such as a paladin’s Lay 
on Hands), all your boils are 
immediately cured and all instances of the spell end, removing all remaining boils and their stored spells.


COURT THE FLAME
2nd-Level Abjuration 
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self
Components: V,  S
Duration: 1 hour


Y ou court the power of a nearby fire to shield
you. Choose one source of nonmagical fire 
that is the size of a torch or larger within 5 
feet of you. Y ou gain a +2 bonus to your AC for the duration. Until this spell ends, if you would take fire damage from any source, you 
can use your reaction to reduce that damage to 
0. If you do, the spell ends. 
If you spend at least 1 minute more than 5 feet away 
from the source of fire you chose when you cast this spell, 
the spell immediately ends.

CHAPTER 5 SPELL DESCRIPTIONS
during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, 
such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the dragon only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the dragon continues to follow it until its task is complete.
The dragon is under your control for 8 hours, after 
which it stops obeying any command you have given it. T o maintain control of the dragon for another 8 hours, you must cast this spell on the dragon before the current 8-hour period ends, or you can use an action to make an ability check using your spellcasting ability contested by the dragon’s Charisma check, reasserting your control over the dragon for another 8 hours on a success.  This use of the spell reasserts your control over the dragon rather than animating a new one. Once you have reasserted your control over the dragon with two successful checks, you can’t do so again until you reassert your control over the dragon at least once with a casting of this spell. 
The GM has the statistics for this creature, using a 
graveyard dragon (see T ome of Beasts 2) or a young black dragon with resistances and damage types appropriate to the type of dragon you targeted with this spell and with the following bonus action: 
Reassemble Bones. As a bonus action, the dragon can 
rearrange its bone structure to fit into a space as narrow as 1 foot wide without squeezing. It can use a bonus action to reassemble itself into its normal form. While in this compressed form, it can’t make melee weapon attacks.

This spell creates an undead servant infected with
disease. Choose up to two corpses of Medium or Small Humanoids within range. Y our spell imbues each target with a foul mimicry of life, raising it as a plague zombie. The plague zombie uses the game statistics of a zombie, except each time the plague zombie hits with a Slam attack, the target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or take poison damage equal to your spellcasting ability modifier and contract the cackle fever or sewer plague disease (your choice). 
As a bonus action on each of your turns, you can 
mentally command any plague zombie you animated with this spell if the creature is within 60 feet of you (if you control multiple plague zombies, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one). Y ou decide what action the plague zombie will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete.
The plague zombie is under your control for 24 hours, 
after which it stops obeying any command you have given it. T o maintain control of the creature for another 24 hours, you must cast this spell on the creature before the current 24-hour period ends. This use of the spell reasserts your control over up to four plague zombies you have animated with this spell, rather than animating new ones.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 
spell slot of 5th level or higher, you animate or reassert control over two additional plague zombies for each slot level above 5th. Each of the plague zombies must come from a different corpse. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the disease the plague zombie inflicts with its Slam attack can now be cackle fever, sewer plague, or one of the diseases detailed in the contagion spell.

slowly in a direction you choose. The grasping, shadowy tendrils occupy up to three 10-foot cubes within range. The mass has a speed of 20 feet, and it moves each round at the end of your turn, ignoring difficult terrain. The shadows can also move vertically or across a ceiling, as long as they can travel along a surface on which to cling. 
All light in this area is reduced to dim light. The surface 
covered by the darkness is considered difficult terrain.


If the darkness moves into the space occupied by a
living creature, that creature takes 6d6 necrotic damage and is restrained. The creature must make a Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the creature takes half the damage and is not restrained. Any creature in the area of the spell at the start of its turn must make another Constitution saving throw, taking damage in each round that it remains in the area. Restrained creatures move with the darkness, dragged along by the shadowy tendrils. A creature can take an action on its turn to make a Strength check against your spell save DC to free itself from the tendrils.
Bright light can destroy portions of the spell. One 
10-foot cube is destroyed if it takes 12 radiant damage. As long as at least one 10-foot cube occupies all or part of a creature’s space, the creature remains restrained.

away from you in a direction following the cone up to the edge of the cone. On a successful save, a creature takes half the damage and isn’t pushed.
When you cast this spell, the phantasmal image of a

must make a Charisma saving throw. If it fails, the target 
becomes frightened of you for the duration. A frightened 
creature can repeat the saving throw each time it takes 
damage, ending the effect on a success. While frightened 
in this way, the creature will not willingly enter or attack

your body and dying immediately.

for each slot level above 1st. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for every two slot levels above 1st. The creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them. 
DENSINI’S RADIANCE
3rd-Level Evocation 
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 120 feetComponents: V,  SDuration: Instantaneous


Y ou call down an explosion of radiant fire from the
heavens on a point you can see in range. Each creature in a 15-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 6d6 radiant damage and is marked with holy radiance until the end of your next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half the damage and isn’t marked.

DESOLATION
8th-Level Necromancy (Ritual)
Casting Time: 1 hour
Range: SelfComponents: V , S, M (an obsidian acorn worth at least 
500 gp, which is consumed in the casting)
Duration: 1 year


Y ou plant an obsidian acorn in solid ground and spend
an hour chanting a litany of curses to the natural world, after which the land within 1 mile of the acorn becomes 
infertile, regardless of its previous state. Nothing will grow there, and all plant life in the area dies over the course of a day. Plant creatures are not affected. Spells that summon plants, such as entangle, require an ability check using the caster’s spellcasting ability against your spell save DC. On a successful check, the spell functions normally; if the check fails, the spell is countered by desolation.
After one year, the land slowly reverts to its normal 
fertility, rejoining the march of nature.


A living creature that finishes a short rest within the
area of a desolation spell halves the result of any Hit Dice it expends. Desolation counters the effects of a bloom spell.
Ritual Focus. If you expend your ritual focus, the 
duration becomes permanent.

DEEP MAGIC VOLUME 2DETECT SECRETS
4th-Level Divination (Ritual) 
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: Self
Components: V , S, M (a magnetic needle floating in a 
bowl of oil)
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
For the duration, you sense the presence of secret doors, 
concealed traps, and areas hidden by magical or mundane 
covers within 30 feet of you. If you sense a secret in this 
way, you see a faint aura around the secret, such as an aura 
outlining a secret door, a glow highlighting a trapped 
flagstone, or a shimmering across the illusory wall that 
hides a passage beyond it.
A secret door or hidden area, for the purpose of this 
spell, includes anything purposefully hidden or concealed 
in some way by its creator. A trap, for the purpose of this 
spell, includes anything that would inflict a sudden or 
unexpected effect you consider harmful or undesirable, which was specifically intended as such by its creator. Thus, the spell would sense an area affected by the alarm spell, a glyph of warding, a mechanical pit trap, a leaf-covered pit, a door behind a hanging tapestry, or a door flush with a 
stone wall that is opened by a pressing a specific stone. 
The spell would not reveal a natural weakness in the floor, 
an unstable ceiling, an evil tome “hidden” in plain sight alongside other books, or a crystalline phylactery “hidden” in a display case with other crystals.
This spell merely reveals a secret’s presence and its 
location. Y ou don’t learn the methods of opening, disarming, or otherwise bypassing or revealing the secret, but you do learn the general nature of the secret and, if it is a trap, the danger it poses.
The spell can penetrate most barriers, but it is blocked 
by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt.

form or a different form. This spell detects only creatures 
whose bodies have been transformed in some way, such as a werewolf ’s Change Shape or the alter self spell. It doesn’t detect creatures disguised by illusions or other similar 
magic, such as a hag’s Illusory Appearance or the disguise 
self spell.The spell can penetrate most barriers, but it is blocked 
by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of 
lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt.

slot of 6th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 5th.

500 gp)

creature you can see within range. The vortexes flank the creature and pull it in opposite directions, tearing limbs and flesh. The target must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 3d10 force damage and its speed is halved until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, it takes half the damage and its speed isn’t reduced.
Until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action on 
each of your turns to force this creature to repeat the saving throw, taking damage and reducing its speed as normal. The spell ends early if the target is ever outside the spell’s range.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell 
slot of 7th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 6th.

saving throw, it disappears from its current location and 
reappears 30 feet away from you in a direction of your 
choice. This travel can take it through walls, creatures, or 
other solid surfaces, but the target can’t reappear inside a 
solid object or not on solid ground; instead, it reappears in 
the nearest safe, unoccupied space along the path of travel.

or similarly work together on their turns. At the GM’s 
discretion, the creatures might attack each other, might 
compete for the tastiest among you and your friends, or similarly act against each other.

effect must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is unable to make more than one attack on 
its turn, and it is unable to use bonus actions or reactions until the start of its next turn. If the creature that failed the save is maintaining concentration on a spell, it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or lose concentration.

Y our touch wards an arch, doorway, entryway, or other 
threshold against intruders. For the duration of the spell, each time a creature attempts to cross the warded threshold, the creature must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is redirected away from the threshold as if it had passed through the threshold from the other side, and it forgets its primary, intended course of action in relation to the threshold, such as obtaining an object or chasing a creature on the other side of the threshold, for 1 minute. On a successful save, the creature is redirected away from the threshold, but it doesn’t forget its primary, intended course of action. 
When you cast this spell, you can designate a password 
or other trigger that allows a creature to pass through the threshold unimpeded, such as walking through the threshold backward or whistling a specific tune while stepping through the threshold.


Y ou can create a permanently warded threshold by
casting this spell on that threshold every day for a year and a day.

• The target can’t see beyond 30 feet.
• The target has disadvantage on attack rolls.
• The target has disadvantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws and checks.
• The target has advantage on Intelligence and Wisdom saving throws and checks.

lasting 3 rounds. Creatures within 5 feet of you, including 
yourself, must make a Constitution saving throw when 
the spell is cast and again at the start of each of your turns 
while the spell is in effect. A creature whose saving throw 
fails is restrained; a restrained creature whose saving 
throw fails is paralyzed; and a paralyzed creature whose 
saving throw fails is petrified and transforms into a statue 
of blue crystal. As with all concentration spells, you can 
end the field at any time (no action required). If you are 
turned to crystal, the spell ends after all affected creatures 
make their saving throws. Restrained and paralyzed 
creatures recover immediately when the spell ends, but petrification is permanent.
Creatures turned to crystal can see, hear, and smell 
normally, but they don’t need to eat or breathe. If shatter is cast on a crystal creature, it must succeed on a

CHAPTER 5 SPELL DESCRIPTIONSDOOM OF DANCING BLADES
3rd-Level Illusion 
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self
Components: V,  S
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour
Y ou create 1d4 illusory copies of your weapon that float 
in the air 5 feet from you. These images move with you, 
spinning, shifting, and mimicking your attacks. When 
you are hit by a melee attack but the attack roll exceeded 
your Armor Class by 3 or less, one illusory weapon parries 
the attack; you take no damage and the illusory weapon 
is destroyed. When you are hit by a melee attack that an 
illusory weapon can’t parry (the attack roll exceeds your 
AC by 4 or more), you take only half as much damage 
from the attack, and an illusory weapon is destroyed. 
Spells and effects that affect an area or don’t require an 
attack roll affect you normally and don’t destroy any 
illusory weapons.


If you make a melee attack that scores a critical hit while
doom of dancing blades is in effect on you, all your illusory weapons also strike the target and deal 1d8 bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage (your choice) each.


The spell ends when its duration expires or when all
your illusory weapons are destroyed or expended.


An attacker must be able to see the illusory weapons to
be affected. The spell has no effect if you are invisible or in total darkness or if the attacker is blinded.


DOOM OF DESTINY
2nd-Level Enchantment 
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: 30 feet
Components: V , S, M (a cracked mirror)Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute


Up to three creatures of your choice that you can see
within range must make Charisma saving throws. Whenever a target that fails this saving throw makes an attack roll or a saving throw before the spell ends, the target rolls with disadvantage.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell 
slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional 
creature for each slot level above 2nd.DOOM OF DISENCHANTMENT
3rd-Level Abjuration 
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self
Components: V,  S
Duration: Concentration, up to 5 rounds
When you cast doom of disenchantment, your armor and 
shield glow with light. When a creature hits you with an 
attack, the spell counters any magic that provides the attack 
with a bonus to hit or to damage. For example, a +1 weapon 
would still be considered magical, but it gets neither +1 to 
hit nor +1 to damage on any attack against you.


The spell also suppresses other magical properties of
the attack. A sword of wounding, for example, can’t cause 
ongoing wounds on you, and you recover hit points lost 
to the weapon’s damage normally. If the attack was a spell, 
it’s affected as if you had cast counterspell, using Charisma 
as your spellcasting ability. Spells with a duration of 
instantaneous, however, are unaffected.


DOOM OF FALSE FRIENDS
8th-Level Enchantment 
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feetComponents: V , S, M (a pink rose petal)Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute


Y ou sever the bonds of friendship and affection between
your targets. T arget two creatures of your choice within range that can hear and see you. Each target must make 
a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, a target must 
use its movement and action to move toward and attack 
the other target of the spell. If an unaffected target of the spell moves out of range, the other target must make every effort to find and attack it. At the end of each turn 
that one of the targets cannot see the other target, it can 
make a new saving throw, overcoming the compulsion on 
a successful save. 
Once all the spell’s targets make successful saving 
throws, you become stunned until the end of your next turn.
At Higher Levels. If you cast this spell using a 9th level 
slot, you can target two additional creatures. Each of the 
targets can decide on its turn which of the other targets it 
attacks or otherwise works against for the moment.

Components: V , S, M (a small bell) 
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute 
All creatures within 10 feet of you must make a Wisdom 
saving throw. Y ou must also make this save. On a failed 
save, targets become bumbling and inept for the duration 
of the spell. When you cast this spell, choose one from the 
following options: 
• Choose one ability score. While doomed, the target has disadvantage on ability checks and saving throws made 
with that ability score. 
• While doomed, the target falls prone at the start of each 
round, and its speed is halved. 
• While doomed, the target must make a Wisdom saving 
throw at the start of each of its turns. If it fails, it wastes 
its action that turn, doing nothing. 
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell 
slot of 2nd level or higher, the duration is up to 10 minutes. If you use a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the duration is up to 8 hours. Using a spell slot of 4th level or higher grants a duration that doesn’t require concentration.

Range: Self (10-foot radius)
Components: V , S, M (a chicken doll)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute 
All creatures within range (including you) perceive 
everything as hilariously funny and fall into fits of laughter 
if this spell affects them. The targets must make a Wisdom 
saving throw. Y ou must also make this save. On a failed 
save, targets fall prone, becoming incapacitated and unable to stand up for the duration. Creatures with an Intelligence score of 4 or less are not affected. At the end of each of its turns, and each time it takes damage, a target 
can make another Wisdom saving throw. The target has 
advantage on the saving throw if it’s triggered by damage. 
On a success, the spell’s effect ends.


DOOM OF NIGHT
6th-Level Conjuration 
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: 120 feet
Components: V , S, M (a vial of shadow dust) 
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes 
Y ou create a 30-foot-radius sphere of pulsing, luminous 
purple mist centered on a point you choose within range. This area is heavily obscured. When a creature enters the 
spell’s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, that creature must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 5d12 necrotic damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. Creatures are affected even if they hold their breath or don’t need to breathe. After leaving the mist, the creature takes 5 points of necrotic damage per round until it succeeds on a Constitution saving throw or dies. 
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell 
slot of 7th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d12 for each slot level above 6th. The follow-on damage increases by 1 point for each slot level above 6th.


DOOM OF POOR FORTUNE
1st-Level Necromancy 
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 30 feet
Components: V , S, M (a dead clover)Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute


Y ou turn luck against a creature of your choice within
range. When the target makes an ability check, they must first make a Charisma saving throw or the check fails. This spell persists once cast, even if the target moves out of range. If cast with a higher-level slot, each subsequent effect is added to the effect noted above.
If the target ultimately succeeds on the check (or saving 
throw or attack at higher levels), then you take 1 psychic damage. If you ever unintentionally lose concentration on the spell, you take 1d4 psychic damage. 
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell 
slot of 2nd-level or higher, when the target is required to make a saving throw, it must make a Charisma saving throw in place of the required one, unless the required one is more difficult to make. When you cast this spell with a 4th-level slot, when the target makes an attack roll, it must make a Charisma saving throw prior to making the attack. On a failed save, the attack fails. If you cast this spell with an 8th-level slot, this spell persists for the duration without requiring concentration.


DOOM OF SERPENT COILS
4th-Level Necromancy 
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self (10-foot radius)
Components: V , S, M (a vial of poison)Duration: Instantaneous


Y ou drink a dose of venom or other poison and spread
the effect to other living things around you. If the poison normally allows a saving throw, your save automatically fails. Y ou suffer the effect of the poison normally before spreading the poison to all other living creatures within 10 feet of you. Instead of making the usual saving throw 
169
CHAPTER 5 SPELL DESCRIPTIONS
against the poison, each creature around you makes 
a Constitution saving throw against the spell. On a successful save, a target suffers no damage or other effect from the poison and is immune to further castings of doom of serpent coils for 24 hours. On a failed save, a target doesn’t suffer the poison’s usual effect; instead, it takes 4d6 poison damage and is poisoned. While poisoned in this way, a creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a subsequent failed save, it takes 4d6 poison damage and is still poisoned. On a subsequent successful save, it is no longer poisoned and is immune to further castings of doom of serpent coils for 24 hours.


Multiple castings of this spell have no additional effect
on creatures that are already poisoned by it. The effect can be ended by protection from poison or comparable magic.


DOOM OF STACKED STONES
6th-Level Transmutation 
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 30 feetComponents: V , S, M (a granite pebble)Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute


Y ou and three creatures of your choice within range must
succeed on a Constitution saving throw when the spell is cast and again at the start of each of your turns while the spell is in effect. A creature whose saving throw fails is restrained. If one of the three targeted creatures fails this saving throw, as many as two other creatures (per initial target), each within 30 feet of the initial target, must make the same save. A restrained creature must continue to make saving throws each turn, and their condition worsens on a failure, as follows:


Number of
Turns Affected Condition
1 (spell is cast) Restrained
2 Incapacitated
3 Stunned
4 Paralyzed
5 Petrified (turned to stone)
Each condition afflicted adds to the previous conditions.


New saving throws reduce the severity of the condition
affecting a target by one step on a success. If a target 
other than you succeeds on the saving throw while it is 
restrained, the spell ends for it. (Y ou must make a saving 
throw each round.)
As with all concentration spells, you can end the spell at 
any time (no action required). If you are turned to stone, 
the spell ends after all affected creatures make their saving 
throws. Creatures recover immediately when the spell 
ends, except for creatures turned to stone, which remain 
that way until the effect is removed.Creatures turned to stone can see, hear, and smell 
normally, but they don’t need to eat or breathe. If shatter is 
cast on a stone creature, it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against the caster’s spell save DC or be killed.


Creatures transformed into stone can be restored with
dispel magic, greater restoration, or comparable magic.


DOOM OF SUMMER YEARS
7th-Level Transmutation 
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 30 feetComponents: V , S, M (a pinch of sand from an 
hourglass)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Y ou rapidly reduce the age of your target. Choose a 
living creature within range. At the time the spell is cast and again at the start of each of your turns, your target must make a Constitution saving throw, decreasing 1d4 + 1 years in age on a successful save or 1 year on a failed one. A target ceases the de-aging process once it is reduced to infancy. A creature that is reduced in age retains all of its memories, ability scores, and features, 
170
DEEP MAGIC VOLUME 2but it gains 1 level of exhaustion for each 5 years it is 
reduced in age. A Medium creature reduced to childhood cannot use weapons with the heavy property. A Medium creature reduced to infancy cannot wield weapons or use tools. If the spell ends before 1 minute has passed, the target reverts to its true age. Otherwise, the targets is permanently reduced to its new age. Remove curse and greater restoration can be used to return a creature to its true age.


If you ever unintentionally lose concentration on the
spell, you gain levels in exhaustion equal to what the target gained from this spell.


DOOM OF THE BLACK RIVER
4th-Level Transmutation 
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: Self (10-foot radius)
Components: V , S, M (marsh water) Duration: Instantaneous


Y ou speak a word of unmaking that devours all wood
and leather in the area, destroying leather armor, shield straps, spear shafts, arrows, bows, staves, clubs, and so forth, including your own items. Objects made of other materials, such as linen, wool, glass, and metals, are unaffected. Items that are worn or held gain a collective Dexterity saving throw by the wearer. On a successful save, none of that wearer’s items are affected. Magical items are never affected by this spell.


DOOM OF THE CRACKED SHIELD
1st-Level Transmutation 
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: T ouch
Components: V,  SDuration: Instantaneous
Doom of the cracked shield is cast on a melee weapon. The 
next time that weapon is used, it destroys the target’s nonmagical shield or damages nonmagical armor, in addition to the normal effect of the attack. If the foe is using a nonmagical shield, it breaks into pieces. If the foe doesn’t use a shield, its nonmagical armor takes a −2 penalty to AC. If the target doesn’t use armor or a shield, the spell is expended with no effect.


DOOM OF THE EARTHEN MAW
4th-Level Evocation 
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V,  SDuration: 1 minute
The ground within 30 feet of a point you designate within 
range turns into filthy and slippery muck. This spell affects sand, earth, mud, and ice, but not stone, wood, or other material. For the duration, the ground in the affected area is difficult terrain. A creature in the area when you cast the spell must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be restrained by the mud until the spell ends. A restrained creature can free itself by using an action to make a successful Strength saving throw. A creature that frees itself or that enters the area after the spell was cast is affected by the difficult terrain but doesn’t become restrained.
Each round, a restrained creature sinks deeper into the 
muck. A Medium or smaller creature that is restrained for 3 rounds becomes submerged at the end of its third turn. A Large creature becomes submerged after 4 rounds. Submerged creatures begin suffocating if they aren’t holding their breath. A creature that is still submerged when the spell ends is sealed beneath the newly solidified ground. The creature can escape only if someone else digs it out or it has a burrowing speed.


DOOM OF THE PIT
4th-Level Conjuration 
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 120 feetComponents: V , S, M (a pinch of dust from a stone 
quarry)
Duration: 1 minute


Y ou create a ripple of dark energy that destroys everything
it touches. A 10-foot-radius, 10-foot-deep, cylindrical extradimensional hole appears on a horizontal surface of sufficient size. Since it extends into another dimension, the pit has no weight and does not otherwise displace the original underlying material. Y ou can create the pit in the deck of a ship as easily as in a dungeon floor or the ground of a forest.
The pit’s radius expands by 10 feet at the start of your 
turn each round for the duration. Any creature standing in the original conjured space, or on a space taken up by the pit as it grows, must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw to avoid falling in. Any creature adjacent to the pit when it expands must likewise succeed on a Dexterity saving throw to avoid falling in. Creatures subjected to a successful pushing effect (such as by a spell like gust of wind) may not make this saving throw. Creatures that fall into the pit take falling damage as normal. 
The walls of the pit are slick and slimy, requiring a DC 
15 Strength (Athletics) check to climb. Creatures and objects that remain in the pit take 1d6 necrotic damage at the start of each of their turns. If you fall into your own pit, you take damage; then the spell ends and you are incapacitated for 2 rounds. When the spell ends, the floor of the pit rises, bringing creatures in the pit back up to the original surface. Each creature in the pit must then make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is

the dreams of nearby plants. The canopy extends out from you to a distance of 5 feet for the duration, surrounding you in the images and minor sounds of these dreams. 
When you cast this spell, you can designate any number of creatures you can see to be unaffected by it. At the start of each of your turns, choose one of the following effects. The effect remains until the start of your next turn when you can choose another effect or to maintain that same effect.
Mesmerleaf. A creature that enters the area for the

Y ou know the current goal or desire of a
creature you can see within range. The target must have an Intelligence of 3 or greater. This spell reveals only the most pressing, important, or impactful goal or desire that is at the top of the mind of the target. It doesn’t reveal any hidden or secret goals or desires, and it doesn’t reveal goals or desires the target wouldn’t already be willing to share with someone it trusts. A creature affected by this spell knows you used magic to learn something about it, and, at the GM’s discretion, it might become hostile toward you or seek retribution against you in some way in the future.

target it with this spell again for 24 hours.

DREAMSTRIDE
3rd-Level Illusion (Ritual)
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: SelfComponents: V,  SDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes


Y ou reach out with your consciousness and step into
the dreams of a creature you can see or a creature that is known to you. The creature must be on the same plane of existence as you and have a minimum Intelligence score of 7. If the target is not asleep or in meditation (in the case of elves or similar races) when the spell is cast, the spell fails. This spell has no effect on constructs or undead. 
When you cast the spell, you enter your target’s dream, 
and you view the events as an invisible third party. The creature is unaware of your presence, and you cannot interact with the dream in any way other than the method listed below.
As an action, you can reach out your consciousness 
and attempt to influence the course of the dream. For example, you may cause something new to appear or cause the tone of the dream to change to a nightmare (or vice-versa) or influence a “character” in the dream other than the target to act a certain way. When you attempt to influence the dream, your target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, your attempt to alter the dream is successful. On a successful save, you are immediately ejected from the dream as the dreamer awakens. 
For the duration of the spell, your body lies in repose 
in the location you cast the spell. Y ou are blind and deaf to your body’s surroundings, though you can feel and are aware if you take damage. If your body is moved, the spell ends. If your target is awakened, the spell ends.

Range: 20 feetComponents: V,  SDuration: Concentration
Y ou conjure up a very light rain, enough to dampen the 
ground in a 20-foot square but not enough to drink or to put out a fire of any size larger than a candle or match. If sustained for 1 minute, the ground is wet to the touch, and if sustained for 10 minutes, the affected area is slightly muddy or slippery, though not enough to impede movement. In freezing weather, this may generate a coating of thin ice.


DUST AND ASHES
4th-Level Transmutation 
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: 30 feet
Components: V , S, M (a ball of crumbly dirt)Duration: Instantaneous


A thin green ray springs from your pointing finger to a
target that you can see within range. The target can be any nonmagical physical object, to a maximum size of 10 feet on a side. If the target is held by a creature, that creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the object is reduced to a pile of fine gray dust. This spell automatically and completely disintegrates a Large or smaller nonmagical object or a creation of magical force. If the target is a Huge or larger object or creation of force, this spell disintegrates a 10-foot-cube portion of it. A magic item is unaffected by this spell.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell 
slot of 5th level or higher, the object size increases by another 10-foot-cube for each slot level above 4th.

7th-Level Evocation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 120 feetComponents: V , S, M (a black pearl worth at least 250 
gp)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
A wave of withering darkness erupts from you, filling a 
120-foot-radius sphere and extinguishing any nonmagical light sources in the area. Any light produced by spells of 6th level or lower is dispelled. Magic items (but not artifacts) that give off light have that property suppressed while in the spell’s area. Any light sources brought into the area during the spell’s duration are likewise extinguished. Light-producing spells of 7th level or higher function within the area.


Nonmagical light sources removed from the area can be
reignited. Magic items regain their ability to give off light 1 round after leaving the area. This magical darkness foils darkvision, except for creatures that can see in magical darkness, such as devils. Y ou can see within the area of the spell as if it were brightly lit.


Each creature you choose to be affected that ends its
turn in the darkness takes 4d8 necrotic damage and gains one level of exhaustion. A successful Constitution saving throw halves the damage and negates the exhaustion.

creatures you can see within range the ability burrow through nonmagical, unworked earth and stone for the duration. Each target gains a burrowing speed equal to half its walking speed. While burrowing, an affected target doesn’t disturb the material through which it moves.

target within unworked earth or stone, the spell carries the target to the surface at a rate of 60 feet per round.
EEN’S ARMOR OF GLASS
6th-Level Conjuration 
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: SelfComponents: V , S, M (a glass marble 
inlaid with silver worth at least 50 gp)
Duration: 1 hour


Y ou conjure a magical suit of glass armor
over your existing armor and apparel for the duration. The glass armor appears in any color and style you choose. If you are wearing heavy armor, you have disadvantage on attack rolls as the bulk of the glass armor on top of the heavy armor limits your range of movement. Until this spell ends, your AC increases by 3 and you have advantage on saving throws against spells and effects that would alter your form. 
When you cast this spell, the armor has a number 
of charges equal to your spellcasting ability modifier. Whenever you take cold, fire, lightning, or poison damage, you can use your reaction to expend a charge and reduce that damage to zero. The spell ends early if all charges are expended.


If you take thunder damage while wearing this glass
armor, you must make a Constitution saving throw as if you were concentrating on a spell. On a failed save, this spell ends, as the glass armor shatters from the thunder damage.EEN’S MOLTEN SHARD


Conjuration Cantrip
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: Self
Components: V,  SDuration: 1 minute
Y ou conjure two small, magical shards of molten glass 
that circle around you. The shards appear in any color and pattern you wish. Until this spell ends, you can use your reaction to command a shard to hinder one melee attack 
against you. If you do so, that shard flies between you 
and your attacker and shatters, imposing disadvantage 
on the attack roll. If the attack hits you, the attacker takes 1d4 piercing damage. When all shards have shattered, the spell ends.


The spell conjures one additional shard when you reach
5th level (three shards), 11th level (four shards), and 17th level (five shards).

3rd-Level Conjuration 
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self (10-foot radius) 
Components: V,  S
Duration: Concentration up to 1 minute
Y ou conjure glass shards that take on shapes, colors, and 
styles of your choice. The shards spin in a dazzling display 
around you to a distance of 10 feet for the duration. A 
creature in the aura of shards has disadvantage on the 
first attack roll it makes against you each turn, and when a 
creature enters the spell’s area for the first time on a turn 
or starts its turn there, it must make a Dexterity saving 
throw, taking 3d6 slashing damage on a failed save, or half 
as much damage on a successful one. 
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell 
slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.


EFFERVESCE SENSE
Transmutation Cantrip 
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: T ouchComponents: V , S Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute


Y ou transform one sensory organ of a willing creature
you touch. Choose one of the target’s sensory organs 
(eyes, nose, mouth, ears, or skin). In a blur of magical 
bubbles that inflate and pop around it, the chosen organ transforms into the corresponding organ of an animal, enhancing the associated sense (sight for eyes, smell for 
nose, taste for mouth, hearing for ears, and touch for 
skin). For example, a pair of transformed eyes might 
become like a chameleon’s or owl’s, while transformed skin might become covered in millions of tiny hairs like those on a spider or the skin of the target’s hand might 
become exceptionally fleshy like a star-nosed mole’s nose.
Once before the spell ends, the target can grant itself 
advantage on one Wisdom (Perception) check of its 
choice using that sense. The spell then ends. At the GM’s 
discretion, this advantage can be applied to a different 
ability check related to the chosen sensory organ, such as 
a rogue gaining advantage on a thieves’ tools check while 
listening to the tumblers within a lock the rogue is picking.


This spell has no effect on a creature with a naturally
strong sense, such as a badger’s already-enhanced smell 
from its Keen Smell trait (though this spell can be used to 
enhance the badger’s sight or hearing). ELECTRIC EELS
4th-Level Evocation

for the duration or until you cast this spell again. When 
you cast the spell, you can force each lightning eel to 
emit a single bolt of lightning at a creature within 5 feet 
of it. Make one melee spell attack for each eel. On a hit, 
the target takes lightning damage equal to 2d6 + your 
spellcasting ability modifier.
As a bonus action on your turn, you can move each 
lightning eel up to 30 feet and repeat the attack against a 
creature within 5 feet of it.
If one lightning eel is within 5 feet of you, you have 
resistance to lightning damage. If both eels are within 5 
feet of you, you have immunity to lightning damage.

Nonmagical effects can’t increase the level of illumination in the affected area.


A spell that creates darkness or shadow takes effect in
the area as if the spell slot expended was one level higher than the spell slot actually used.

save, the target takes 4d6 fire damage and is grappled by 
the fiery serpent. On a successful save, the target takes 
half the damage and isn’t grappled. At the end of each of 
the grappled target’s turns, it takes 2d6 fire damage. A 
creature grappled by the fiery serpent can use its action to 
make a Strength or Dexterity check (the target’s choice) 
against your spell save DC. If it succeeds, it is no longer 
grappled, and the spell ends on it.

target attempts to cast a spell with a verbal component 
targeting you or another member of your faith, or if 
it attempts to cast a spell with a verbal component 
while in a place dedicated to your deity, it must make a 
Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the spell fails 
to cast, expending the action used to cast it but not the 
spell slot or use.

At the start of the target’s next turn, the disease ends on the target and moves to a creature hostile to you within 10 feet of the target. The new target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 3d8 necrotic damage and be infected with the disease. The disease continues moving from target to target in this way, reducing the amount of necrotic damage by 1d8 each time the disease moves to a new target. On a failed save, the final target takes 1d8 necrotic damage and this spell ends. If a target succeeds on a Constitution saving throw, it takes half the damage, and the disease doesn’t jump to a new target, ending the spell. A creature can take damage from this spell only once per casting of this spell.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell 
slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 4th.

creature within 60 feet of you casting a spell
Range: 60 feet
Components: SDuration: Instantaneous
With a wink and a nod, you attempt to take control of a 
spell as it is being cast. If the creature is casting a spell of 4th level or lower, make an ability check using your spellcasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the spell’s level. On a success, you gain control of the spell as if you cast it from that creature’s space. Y ou can choose the direction of the line, the point where the spell is centered, the spell’s targets, and any other parameters of the spell. If the spell has a range of Self and doesn’t affect other targets, fey tricks fails. For example, you can redirect the line of a lightning bolt spell with the original caster as the origin, but you wouldn’t be able to take control of the false life spell. 
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell 
slot of 5th level or higher, the spell you take control of can be less than or equal to the level of the spell slot you used.

prevents others from forming concrete memories of you. 
Until the spell ends, a creature that interacts with a target 
for less than 1 minute and in a way that isn’t impactful 
remembers the target only passingly and with only 
vague details. An impactful interaction includes combat, 
being loud in a quiet crowd, or other interaction that 
might be particularly memorable, such as being the only 
person in drab, brown clothing at a noble’s extravagant, 
colorful ball. At the GM’s discretion, other interactions 
might be impactful to a creature based on that creature’s 
personality, occupation, or other factors, such as a target giving a gold coin to a beggar who hasn’t eaten in days.

the targets to be fleeting, vague memories. It doesn’t change a target’s appearance or create any other form of

rolls are modified to account for its reduced attributes.

weapon attack against the maggot with a weapon that deals 
piercing or slashing damage. The maggot has AC equal

damage is dealt to the maggot, and the other half is dealt to 
the target itself. If the maggot is killed, the spell ends.

bonus action on your turn and can use a bonus action on each of your subsequent turns to mentally command it as long as you are within 60 feet of it.

which it stops obeying any command you’ve given it. T o maintain control of the creature for another 24 hours, you must expend a spell slot of 5th level or higher before the current 24-hour period ends.

If you use a spell slot of 9th level or higher, a target

4th-Level Conjuration 
Casting Time: 1 minute 
Range: 200 feet
Components: V , S, M (an opal worth at least 500 gp, 
which the spell consumes)
Duration: Instantaneous


This spell instantly summons a glittering moonbeam that
transports one sleeping creature or object of your choice 
that you can see within range to a destination you select. 
If you target an unwilling creature, it can make a Wisdom 
saving throw. On a successful save, the spell fails, and 
you appear in the target location instead. A transferred 
creature wakes up as soon as it arrives at its destination. If 
you target an object, it must be able to fit entirely inside a 
10-foot cube, and it can’t be held or carried by an unwilling creature. The destination you choose must be known to 
you, and it must be on the same plane of existence as you. 
Y our familiarity with the destination determines whether the creature or object arrives there successfully. 
The GM rolls a d20 and consults the Lunar T ransfer 
table below. 
• Grove or Magic Circle means a hallowed druid grove or a permanent teleportation circle whose sigil 
sequence you know. 
• Memento means that you possess an object taken 
from the desired destination within the last six months, such as a book from a wizard’s library, bed linen from a royal suite, or a chunk of marble from a 
lich’s secret tomb. 
• Very Familiar is a place you have been very often, a 
place you have carefully studied, or a place you can see 
when you cast the spell. 
• Seen Casually is someplace you have seen more than once but with which you aren’t very familiar. 
• Viewed Once is a place you have seen once, possibly 
using magic. 
• Description is a place whose location and appearance 
you know through someone else’s description, perhaps 
from a map. 
• False Destination is a place that doesn’t exist. 
Perhaps you tried to scry an enemy’s sanctum but 
instead viewed an illusion, or perhaps you are 
attempting to teleport to a familiar location that no 
longer exists.
On Target. The target creature or object appears where 
you want it to.
Off Target. The target creature or object appears a 
random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 5 miles times a d20 roll, 
though never more than half the distance traveled. For 
example, if you sent someone 250 miles and they landed 
197
CHAPTER 5 SPELL DESCRIPTIONSoff target, and you rolled an 8 on the d20, then they would 
arrive off target by 40 miles. If you had sent them only 20 miles, they could not be more than 10 miles off target. The GM determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on around the points of the compass. If you were teleporting someone to a coastal city and they wound up 20 miles out at sea, they could be in trouble.
Similar. Y our target creature or object winds up in a 
different area that’s visually or thematically similar to the target area. If you are sending someone to your home laboratory, for example, they might wind up in another wizard’s laboratory or in an alchemical supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as your laboratory. Generally, the creature or object appears in the closest similar place, but since the spell has no range limit, they could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane.
Mishap. The spell’s unpredictable magic results in a 
difficult journey. The teleporting creature or object takes 2d12 force damage, and the GM rerolls on the table to see where you (instead of the target) wind up. (Multiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage each time.)


LUNARBOLT WAXING
1st-Level Evocation 
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 120 feetComponents: V , S, M (small spherical stone painted 
white)
Duration: Instantaneous


Y ou hurl a bolt of concentrated moonlight at a creature
you can see within range. The bolt expands in size and grows in strength as it travels. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, a target takes 1d10 cold damage and suffers additional damage based on the distance between you and the target, as detailed below:
• If the target is between 35 and 60 feet away from you, it takes an additional 1d4 radiant damage.• If the target is between 65 and 90 feet away from you, it takes an additional 2d4 radiant damage.
• If the target is between 95 and 120 feet away from you, it takes an additional 3d4 radiant damage.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell 
slot of 2nd level or higher, the cold damage increases by 1d10 for every two slot levels above 1st. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the d4s of the additional radiant damage become d6s.

When a creature in the spell’s area casts a spell of the chosen school, it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or the spell fails to cast, expending the action and the spell’s use or spell slot. 
Active magical effects of the chosen school, such as the 
spell false life when dampening necromancy or the spell mage armor when dampening abjuration, are suppressed while within this spell’s area. While an effect is suppressed, it doesn’t function, but the time it spends suppressed counts against its duration.
This spell has no affect on spells cast outside the spell’s 
area. 
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell 
slot of 4th level or higher, the radius of the spell increases by 10 feet for each slot level above 3rd.LUNAR TRANSFER

this spell ends, the ammunition becomes magically magnetized as it hits the target.


The magnetized ammunition clings to the target until
removed. When the target moves into or through a space 
that is within 10 feet of a creature wearing metal armor 
or of a Small or larger metal object, such as an anvil, a statue, a decorative suit of armor hanging on a wall, or similar, the target treats that space as difficult terrain as 
the magnetized ammunition pulls the target toward that 
creature or object.


A creature with magnetized ammunition clinging to it
can use its action to make a Strength check against your 
spell save DC. On a success, the ammunition is removed 
and crumbles to dust.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 
spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can magnetize one additional piece of ammunition for each slot level  
above 1st. MAGNIFY WEAPON

A wave of magical disease washes out from a point of
your choice within range. Choose up to three creatures in a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on that point. Each target is infected by a magical disease and regains hit 
points equal to 3d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier. 
The next time an infected target takes damage, the 
disease ends on the target and infects a new friendly 
creature within 10 feet of the first. The new target regains hit points equal to 2d8 + your spellcasting ability 
modifier. The next time the new target takes 
damage, the disease ends on it and moves to 
another friendly creature within 10 feet of it. The disease continues moving from target to target in this way, reducing the amount of 
healing by 1d8 each time the disease moves to 
a new target. The final target regains hit points 
equal to 1d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier and 
that instance of the disease ends. This spell ends early 
if all instances of the disease end.


A creature can be healed multiple times by this spell
but can have only one instance of the disease on it at 
a time. If a creature already has an instance of this 
disease and would gain another, the previous instance 
of the disease immediately moves to another valid 
target as if the creature had taken damage. This spell 
has no effect on Undead or Constructs.

target’s space and vice versa. The two targets must be 
within one size category of each other. A creature can’t be 
teleported into damaging terrain or into a space it can’t

the target takes 1d6 necrotic damage, and it ages one hour.  
On a successful save, the target takes half the damage and 
doesn’t age one hour.


As part of casting this spell or as a bonus action on a
subsequent turn but before your next long rest, you can consume this stolen hour of time. Alternatively, you can gift the time to a friendly creature you can see within 
range. As a bonus action at any point before your next long rest, that creature can consume the stolen time.

choice that you can see within range. The area of water must be large enough to accommodate the boat, at least 100 feet long, 20 feet wide, and 15 feet deep, and it must be clear of any other boats or structures. Any creatures in the area are harmlessly pushed out of the boat’s space.
The warship is a Gargantuan vehicle that is 100 feet 
long and 20 feet wide. The ship has four siege weapons on the deck: two ballistae and two cannons.
Below deck is divided into two floors: the lower deck 
and the hold. Each level of the ship is connected by wooden stairs. Below deck is furnished and decorated however you like, and it contains sufficient food to serve a nine-course banquet for up to 60 people each day. Furnishing, food, and other objects created by this spell crumble to dust if removed from the ship.


A crew of forty invisible servants obeys any commands
given to it by creatures you designate when you cast the spell. Each servant functions as if created by the unseen servant spell.


The ship and the siege weapons aboard it are all made
of wood and metal that can be damaged, but they are immune to poison damage and psychic damage. The hull of the ship has AC 15 and 500 hit points. The ballistae have AC 15 and 50 hit points each. The cannons have AC 19 and 75 hit points each.

CHAPTER 5 SPELL DESCRIPTIONSMINIATURE HURRICANE
3rd-Level Evocation 
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V , S, M (a stone submerged in a jar of 
seawater)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute


Y ou conjure a miniature hurricane on a point you can
see within range. The hurricane forms in a 40-foot-tall 
cylinder with a 20-foot-radius centered on that point. 
When a creature enters the spell’s area for the first time 
on a turn or starts its turn there, it is buffeted by rain, ice 
pellets, and roaring wind and must make a Constitution 
saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 3d6 
cold damage, and its speed is halved until it leaves the 
hurricane. On a successful save, a creature takes half the 
damage, and its speed isn’t reduced.
Until the spell ends, the hurricane moves up to 20 feet 
in a random direction at the start of each of your turns. T o

Enchantment Cantrip 
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 30 feet
Components: V,  S
Duration: Instantaneous
Y ou gesture to a creature within range that you can see. If 
the target fails a Wisdom saving throw, it uses its reaction 
to move 5 feet in a direction you dictate. This movement 
does not provoke opportunity attacks. The spell automatically fails if you direct the target into a dangerous area such as a pit trap, a bonfire, or off the edge of a cliff, or 
if the target has already used its reaction.

Y ou create a dark rain cloud in the shape of a cylinder that
is 10 feet tall with a 40-foot radius, centered on the point 
you can see 100 feet in the sky directly above you. The spell 
fails if you can’t see a point in the air where the rain cloud 
could appear (for example, if you are in a room that can’t 
accommodate the cloud). The cloud remains centered on 
you in the sky above you, and moving to a place where you 
don’t have a clear path to the sky ends the spell early.Until the spell ends, heavy rain and hailstones fall in 
the area within 40 feet of you, pummeling creatures and 
objects and loosening the ground. Nonmagical fires in the area are extinguished, the area is lightly obscured, and the ground in the area is difficult terrain. Any creature other than you that starts its turn in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 2d10 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. When you cast this spell, you can designate any number of creatures you can see to be unaffected by it.

inscribe a glyph that covers a 10-foot-square area on a flat, stationary surface such as a floor or a wall. Once the spell is complete, the glyph is invisible in moonlight but glows with a faint white light in darkness.
Any creature that touches the glyph, except those you 
designate during the casting of the spell, must make a successful Wisdom saving throw or be drawn into an inescapable maze until the sun rises.

Charisma (Persuasion) check to compel the fiend to seek out a particular creature you choose that is on the same plane of existence as you. On a success, the fiend slinks off to its target, usually but not always by night. On a failure, the fiend refuses, and the offering and the bowl are consumed in the casting.


The conjured fiend may find that the target
is warded or inaccessible or simply difficult to find (whether because of invisibility or some other reason). In this case, you must make a DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check. On a success, the fiend returns and demands no further offering, reports its failure, and vanishes. On a failure, the fiend returns and demands another offering. If this is not immediately forthcoming, it attacks you.MOONSPHERE METEOR

or carried is buried under 5 feet of mud. Each creature in

save, a creature takes 3d10 bludgeoning damage and is 
pushed up to half the length of the line in a direction 
following the line, knocked prone, and buried under 
the mud. On a successful save, a creature takes half the

creature to pass through. When you cast this spell, choose 
a nonmagical archway, doorway, or other threshold you 
have moved through at least once within 100 miles of

is destroyed. 
When you cast this spell, you can choose a number 
of creatures equal to your spellcasting ability modifier.

doorways, opening the destination doors if necessary.

locations weren’t tied to magical doorways.

Dreams can be gateways to understanding, and you can 
induce such prophetic and insightful dreams in yourself and others. Y ou touch a willing creature of your choice. The creature immediately falls into an enchanted dream state and remains that way for the full length of a normal long rest for that creature, unless awakened or if the target chooses to end the spell early. 
During this long rest, the target experiences dreams 
and visions centering around one event or question of its choice, specified at the casting of the spell. The answer in the dreams may be literal, or it may be wrapped in symbolism, omens, and metaphor and left to the dreamer to interpret. This spell doesn’t disrupt the target’s long rest, and the target can still gain the benefits of a long rest if it finishes the long rest while affected by this spell. 
If the target’s sleep is interrupted, this spell ends and 
must be cast again for the target to experience the  dreams again.

Range: T ouch
Components: V,  SDuration: 1 round


Y ou touch a creature suffering from exhaustion or a
poison or disease. Until the start of your next turn, 
the effects of the exhaustion, poison, or disease are 
suppressed. This spell doesn’t cure the exhaustion, 
poison, or disease, but it temporarily halts the effects. 
For example, panacea wouldn’t prevent a poison from 
continuing to deal damage each round, but it would 
temporarily pause a reduction to an ability score caused by 
that poison. After a creature has benefited from this spell 
for 1 minute (10 rounds), it can’t be affected by this spell 
again until it finishes a long rest.

Y ou reach out with your consciousness and influence the dreams of another creature. The creature must be on 
the same plane of existence as you and have a minimum 
Intelligence score of 7. If the target is not asleep or in 
meditation (in the case of elves or similar creatures) when the spell is cast, the spell fails. This spell has no effect on 
Constructs or Undead.
The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On 
a failed save, the target’s dream becomes a nightmare, and it takes 4d10 psychic damage. On a successful save, the target takes half the damage, the spell ends, and you take 4d10 psychic damage as you are shoved from the dream. At the start of each of its turns, the target can make another Wisdom saving throw, taking 4d10 psychic damage on a failed save, or ending the spell on a successful one. Once the target succeeds on its saving throw, it can’t be affected by this spell again until 7 days have passed. The target can’t wake itself, but if it is awakened by an outside force or if it is reduced to 0 hit points, the spell ends. 
If the target succeeds on the saving throw, it can make 
a Wisdom (Insight) check against your spell save DC. On a success, if the target is familiar with you, it recognizes you as the attacker. If the target succeeds but is unfamiliar with you, it doesn’t recognize you, though at the GM’s discretion, it may vaguely recognize you at a later date if you cross paths. 
For the duration of the spell, your body lies in repose 
in the location you cast the spell. Y ou are blind and deaf to your body’s surroundings, though you can feel and are aware if you take damage. If your body is moved, the spell ends. If your target is awakened, the spell ends.

Y ou can communicate telepathically with the soldiers as long as you are on the same plane of existence, and the soldiers obey any commands that you issue to them (no action required by you). If you don’t issue any commands to the soldiers, they defend themselves from hostile creatures or position themselves protectively next to you and your allies, each soldier moving to within 5 feet of at least one of you. While positioned protectively, a soldier can use its reaction to impose disadvantage on a melee attack roll against the target it is protecting,

Undead with the symptoms of a disease of your choice, 
which can include cackle fever, sewer plague, or any of the 
diseases caused by the contagion spell or found in the 
Random Disease table in Chapter 2. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become convinced it is suffering from a disease, including manifesting physical symptoms. However, it suffers no actual damage, conditions, or penalties from this disease. All symptoms are superficial and vanish when the spell ends. This is a curse, not a disease, and as such, spells and effects that cure or detect diseases have no effect.
While cursed and manifesting symptoms, the target 
emits an aura of hysterical fear. A creature that isn’t a Construct or Undead and that comes within 60 feet of the target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of the target. 

208
DEEP MAGIC VOLUME 2While frightened, that creature must take the Dash 
action and move away from the target by the safest 
available route on each of its turns, unless there is nowhere to move. If the creature ends its turn in a location where it doesn’t have line of sight to the cursed target, the creature can make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC, ending the frightened condition on itself on a success. If a creature’s saving throw is successful or the frightened effect ends for it, the creature can’t be frightened by this spell again for the next 24 hours.

follows in your footsteps and lingers on your trail. This miasma is visible as a mist hovering in each space you leave. The mist remains in each of those spaces, forming a trail behind you, for 10 minutes before fading. The mist forms only along the ground and doesn’t form in spaces you left by flying, swimming, or similarly not in contact with the ground.


A creature that enters the miasma for the first time on
a turn or starts its turn there must succeed a Constitution saving throw or take 2d8 poison damage and be poisoned for 1 minute. At the end of each of its turns, a poisoned creature can make another Constitution saving throw, ending the poisoned condition on itself on a success.  Nonmagical plants that aren’t creatures, such as trees and shrubs, wither and die in the miasma in your wake.

2nd-Level Abjuration 
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: T ouch
Components: V,  S

The creature you touch when casting this spell becomes
immune to disease for the duration. The creature can 
still contract and carry diseases; it simply does not suffer 
any effects of a disease. When exposed to a disease, the 
creature must make the saving throw required. If the 
saving throw fails, the creature becomes a carrier of the 
disease and might expose others to it per the rules for the 
particular affliction. The creature under the effect of the 
spell is aware when it becomes infected. If the creature 
recovers from or is cured of all diseases it suffers while this 
spell is in effect, it continues to benefit from the spell until 
the spell ends.
When the duration expires, the target becomes 
susceptible to the effect of any disease it is still carrying, as 
if it had just now contracted it.

RAISE ELDER
6th-Level Necromancy
Casting Time: 1 hour
Range: T ouch
Components: V , S, M (a diamond worth at least 1,000 
gp, which the spell consumes)
Duration: Instantaneous
This spell is identical to raise dead, but it works only on a 
creature that died of old age. The spell grants the raised elder one additional year of life. The raised creature has 
entirely white hair, its eyes are weak, and it loses 2 points 
each from Strength and Constitution; no magic less 
potent than a wish can restore these lost points. In all 
other respects, the creature can live out its life normally 
until the added year elapses.
Raise elder has no effect if it’s cast on the same creature a 
second time.

CHAPTER 5 SPELL DESCRIPTIONSRAISE GHOST
3rd-Level Necromancy
Casting Time: 1 hour
Range: T ouch
Components: V , S, M (a diamond worth at least 500 gp, 
which the spell consumes)
Duration: Instantaneous


Y ou return a dead creature you touch to a ghostly and
incorporeal form, provided it has been dead no longer 
than 10 days. The creature can see and hear, and it can 
speak in a hollow, sepulchral tone if it chooses to. Whether 
it’s willing to speak to you depends on its whim and its 
prior relationship with you, if any.
The affected creature is not undead; it is alive but 
incorporeal, with 1 hit point. It can’t interact with the physical world, attack or cause damage, or cast spells. It 
is immune to nonmagical damage. It can move through 
creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain, but 
it takes 1d10 force damage if it ends its turn inside an object. It regains hit points normally through resting or spending Hit Dice but never recovers hit points via spells, items, or potions.


This spell also neutralizes any poison and cures
nonmagical diseases that affected the creature at the time 
it died. This spell doesn’t remove magical diseases, curses, 
or similar effects; if these aren’t removed prior to casting the spell, they take effect when the creature returns to life. The spell also closes mortal wounds, but it doesn’t restore 
missing body parts. If the creature is lacking body parts or 
organs integral for its survival—its head, for instance—
the spell automatically fails.
Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The target has 
a –4 penalty to saving throws and ability checks. Every 
time the target finishes a long rest, the penalty is reduced 
by 1 until it disappears.
A creature affected by raise ghost is restored to normal, 
physical life by raise dead or comparable magic. Raise ghost 
has no effect if cast on an Undead creature.


RAISE HERO
4th-Level Necromancy
Casting Time: 1 hour
Range: T ouch
Components: V , S, M (a diamond worth at least 500 gp, 
which the spell consumes)
Duration: 24 hours


This spell is identical to raise dead in every way except
duration; the creature is restored to life for only 24 hours. The spell can be recast on the same creature, but on the second and subsequent castings, the caster must roll a 
d20. If the roll is equal to or less than the number of prior 
castings on the same creature, the spell fails and cannot affect that creature again. Each new casting resets the 
clock to 24 hours; it doesn’t stack another 24 hours onto a previous casting.


RAISE NEMESIS
5th-Level Necromancy
Casting Time: 1 hour
Range: T ouchComponents: V , S, M (a diamond worth at least 500 gp, 
which the spell consumes)
Duration: Instantaneous
This spell is identical to raise dead, except it simultaneously 
raises two creatures with opposite alignments. For example, if you raise a Lawful Good paladin, then somewhere nearby, a Chaotic Evil warrior of similar power also returns to life. The second corpse must be within 100 miles. The two raised creatures have a vague sense of the direction and distance to their nemesis. They aren’t compelled to battle one another or even to seek each other out. Their lives are, however, inextricably bound together in such a way that if either of them dies, the other also drops dead instantly.


Evil NPCs brought back with raise nemesis typically
see it as an opportunity to create every sort of trouble imaginable.


If the spell is cast on a creature of true Neutral
alignment, only that creature is restored to life.


RAISE QUESTING DEAD
6th-Level Necromancy
Casting Time: 1 hour
Range: T ouch
Components: V , S, M (a diamond worth at least 500 gp, 
which the spell consumes)
Duration: Instantaneous
This spell is identical to raise dead, except it empowers you 
to impose a geas on the creature you raise. The targeted soul can opt to decline the geas, in which case it isn’t restored to life. If the creature accepts your geas, it must complete the task within 30 days. If it accepts but fails to meet the conditions of the geas, it dies on the dawn of the 31st day and its spirit again departs the mortal world. If it accomplishes the task, it’s free to live out the remainder of its restored life as it chooses.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell 
slot of 7th or 8th level, the creature has a year to fulfill its geas, allowing for much more complex demands. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 9th level, the geas lasts until it’s fulfilled, no matter how long that takes, or until it’s ended by remove curse, greater restoration, or wish.

which the spell consumes)
Duration: Instantaneous
This spell is identical to raise ghost in every way, except 
the ghostly figure can manipulate, hold, or carry objects 
weighing up to 5 pounds. Note that while 5 pounds of 
force is enough to pick up many melee weapons, it’s not 
sufficient to wield one in combat or to draw a bow.

Y our touch inflicts disease. Make a melee spell attack 
against a creature within reach. On a hit, you afflict the 
creature with one of two possible rat plagues, described below. At the end of each of the target’s turns, it must make a Constitution saving throw. After failing three 
of these saving throws, the disease’s effects last for the 
duration, and the creature stops making these saves. After 
succeeding on three of these saving throws, the creature recovers from the disease, and the spell ends. Since this spell induces a natural disease in its target, any effect that 
removes a disease or otherwise ameliorates a disease’s 
effects apply to it.
Rat Fever. A creeping horror of rats, ratfolk, wererats, 
and all other rat-like creatures enters the creature’s mind, 
and it fears contact with rats and is terrified of crowds. The 
creature is frightened of rats for the duration.
Rat Shakes. Violent shivers convulse the creature’s 
limbs, its speed is halved, and it cannot use the Dash 
action. After making any melee or spell attack, the creature falls prone.

Y our magic summons an illusory recreation of an event, 
allowing you to watch and learn from different angles. When you cast this spell, choose a period of time you have 
experienced within the last 7 days that is up to 1 minute 
long. Illusory copies of the people, places, and events 
that existed within 30 feet of you during that minute fill the spell’s area. The illusion appears centered on the past version of you and is recreated from your perspective at 
the time you experienced it. The recreation is not limited 
to your line of sight, and it magically recreates everything 
that occurred within 30 feet of you at that time. 
For the duration, you can command the illusion to 
replay, pause, speed up, or slow down as you wish. Y ou 
and other creatures can walk within the illusory scene, 
investigating and watching the event. Y ou have advantage 
on Intelligence (Investigation) and Wisdom (Perception) checks made while observing the event. The spell doesn’t provide insight into the minds of creatures that were present at that time, and it is limited to actions and 
movements that could have been observed by an average 
person experiencing the event. For example, it might 
depict wet footprints left by an invisible creature that walked past you during the event, but it wouldn’t reveal the invisible creature.

succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 3d10 
bludgeoning damage and suffer one of the following 
effects of your choice until the end of its next turn: halved 
speed or disadvantage on attack rolls.

1 minute


Y ou conjure a small rift to another
plane on a point you can see within range. When you cast this spell, 
choose one of the following natures.


The rift exhibits the chosen nature
for the duration. 
Chaos. The rift’s presence warps the 
area around it, disorienting nearby creatures. A creature that starts its turn within 20 feet of the 
rift has disadvantage on the first attack roll it makes 
before the start of its next turn, and when it moves on 
its turn, it moves in a random direction.
Delights. Soothing lights and sounds float out from 
the rift. Each creature that starts its turn within 5 feet of the rift regains hit points equal to your spellcasting 
ability modifier and can’t be frightened until the start 
of its next turn. Horrors. T entacles erupt from the rift and fly toward 
up to three creatures you can see within 20 feet of the rift. 
Each creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be restrained by the tentacles until the spell ends. A creature restrained by the tentacles can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. On a success, it is no longer restrained. If no creatures are restrained by the rift’s tentacles at the end of your turn, the next creature, other than you, to move within 20 feet of the rift must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be restrained by the tentacles for the duration.

If you don’t issue any commands to them, the Celestials defend themselves from hostile creatures but otherwise take no actions.
If your concentration is broken, the Celestials don’t 
disappear. Instead, you lose control of the Celestials, and they may become hostile to you or aid you on their own terms, depending on your alignment and observable actions while the Celestials were summoned.

On a failed save, a Large or smaller creature takes 4d10 bludgeoning damage and is thrown up to 60 feet in a random direction and knocked prone. On a failed save, a Huge or larger creature takes 4d10 bludgeoning damage but is restrained until the start of its next turn instead of being thrown. On a successful save, a creature takes half the damage and isn’t thrown, restrained, or knocked prone, but it is pushed out of the tornado to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the edge of the tornado.If a thrown creature strikes a solid surface, the creature 
takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it was thrown. If the creature is thrown at another creature, that creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC or take the same damage and be knocked prone. If a thrown creature is thrown into another tornado, it is then thrown up to 60 feet again in a random direction from that tornado.
At the start of each of your turns, the tornados move up 
to 30 feet in random directions and can affect you as easily as any other creature. If multiple tornados would move to the same space, one tornado moves to the space, and the other moves to within 10 feet of the space. The spell ends early if you are incapacitated or die.

TO DAVID HANSON
By Chad Hanson
On the day that I was planning to write my spell, I woke 
up to a call telling me that my dad had died. Dad wasn’t a 
gamer, but with his love of westerns I think he would have 
understood the desire for adventure and daring deeds.
“My friend, I do not know what else I shall leave my son, 
but if I have left him a love of language, of literature, 
a taste for Homer, for the poets, the people who have told our story—and by ‘our’ I mean the story 
of mankind—then he will have legacy enough.” Louis

Y ou use a creature’s name to bind its will, reducing its 
effectiveness against you. Choose a creature you can see within range. Y ou must speak at least one name to which the target will answer or with which the target identifies, though you need not know its language. The name can’t be vague, like “ogre,” but it doesn’t have to be the creature’s actual name. For example, the local legend name of “Ol’ Gold Eye” for an ogre with a golden false eye can suffice, if the target often identifies itself as such, if the target is accustomed to answering to the name, or if the name is regularly used by others to define the target.
The target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a 
failed save, it has disadvantage on attack rolls against you, and you have advantage on saving throws against its spells and abilities until the spell ends.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell 
slot of 4th level or higher, you can allow one friendly creature to be included in the benefits of this spell against the target for each slot level above 3rd. Y ou and each of the friendly creatures you want to include must be within 30 feet of each other when you cast this spell.

humanoids.


ANCIENT DRAGON MAGE
With shimmering skin that gleams like scales and cruel reptilian 
eyes, the robed figure speaks in a sibilant tongue as its staff erupts 
with fire.


Ancient dragon mages are powerful spellcasters who
serve ancient dragons. Dragon mages typically begin their 
lives simply as gifted spellcasters who somehow capture 
the attention of the ancient dragon they are ultimately bound to serve. In the case of good-aligned dragons, this relationship is typically a mutual one. In the case 
of evil-aligned dragons, it is not uncommon for gifted 
spellcasters to be abducted and forced into servitude. 
After years spent living with and learning from their draconic masters, these mages evolve into even more potent masters of magic as their bodies transform to become more draconic.
Secretive Stewards. The process by which ancient 
dragons transform their mages is a well-guarded secret.


Little is known about the process beyond the fact that
it requires years or decades of personal contact with 
an ancient dragon. Those who transform into dragon 
mages are imbued with an undying loyalty to the dragon who created them, and each mage’s personality alters, 
sometimes radically, to become complimentary to its 
master’s nature. Type Specific. The abilities of each ancient dragon mage 
are determined by the type of dragon it serves. Those 
familiar with the varieties of dragons can clearly identify 
a dragon mage’s master by the aesthetic changes to the mage’s form. When creating an ancient dragon mage, 
choose which type of dragon it serves. This decision 
changes some of the dragon mage’s statistics, as noted in the ancient dragon mage’s stat block.

Dragon-Blessed. The dragon mage has immunity to a type 
of damage based on the type of dragon that it serves: acid 
(black, copper), cold (silver, white), fire (brass, gold, red), lightning (blue, bronze), or poison (green).
Dragon-Blessed Weapons. The dragon mage’s weapon attacks 
are magical. When the mage hits with any weapon, the weapon deals an extra 4d8 damage of the type determined by Dragon-Blessed (included in the attack).


ACTIONS
Multiattack. The dragon mage can use its Majestic Presence. 
It then makes three Elemental Burst attacks or one Dragon Staff attack and two Elemental Burst attacks. It can replace one attack with a use of Spellcasting. 
Draconic Staff. Melee Weapon Attack:  +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one 
target. Hit: 9 (2d6 + 2) bludgeoning damage plus 18 (4d8) 
damage of the type determined by Dragon-Blessed.
Elemental Burst. Melee or Ranged Spell Attack: +10 to hit, 
reach 5 ft. or range 120 ft., one target. Hit: 27 (5d8 + 5) 
damage of the type determined by Dragon-Blessed. 
Dragon Breath (Recharge 5–6). The mage exhales elemental 
energy in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 54 (12d8) damage of the type determined by Dragon-Blessed on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
Majestic Presence. Each creature of the mage’s choice that is 
within 120 feet of the mage and aware of it must succeed on a DC 16 Charisma saving throw or become charmed by the mage for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns and each time it takes damage, 

243
APPENDIX A: SPELLCASTING NPCSending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature’s saving 
throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is 
immune to the mage’s Majestic Presence for the next 24 
hours.
Spellcasting. The mage casts one of the following spells, using 
Intelligence as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 18).
At will: detect magic , feather fall , fog cloud 
3/day each: dispel magic , suggestion
1/day each: hold monster , wall of force


BONUS ACTIONS
Dragon Wings (3/Day).  A pair of draconic wings sprout from 
the dragon mage’s back for 1 minute or until the mage 
dismisses them as a bonus action. The mage has a flying 
speed of 30 feet for the duration.


ARCHDRUID
What appears to be yet another tree in the forest is revealed as a 
person dressed in animal skins, with deep, wise eyes, seemingly at 
one with their surroundings.


Archdruids are powerful druids who have achieved a
deep communion with the natural world. They typically 
lead druid circles and are the apex of druidic orders.


While other spellcasting orders respect experience and
age, some attain the status of archdruid at a young age, prodigies with an innate connection to the wilds of the world. T o most druids, true communion with the natural 
world matters more than experience or survivability. 
Circle Champions. Archdruids who are leaders of druidic 
circles or other groups reflect and champion the concerns 
of their organizations. When two circles differ in their 
approach on how to handle a threat or situation, it’s the 
archdruids leading those circles who attempt to find a 
resolution. These conflicts can range from spirited debate 
to shapechanger combat, reflecting the sometimes-violent 
struggles of the wilds. 
Call of the Wild. Archdruids carefully cultivate their 
deep communion with nature, but tales speak of those 
archdruids who connect so deeply that they lose the sense of themselves. Such druids spend most of their time in 
animal forms, or standing in one position, emulating a 
tree. Though they are left alone by the other creatures of 
their chosen terrain, they lose touch with the members 
of their circle, and coaxing them back can be a difficult prospect. Archdruid

Nature’s Champion. While the archdruid is conscious, 
wearing no armor, and in a natural environment or terrain, 
such as a desert, forest, or mountain, it adds its Wisdom modifier to its AC (included above).
Nature’s Weapons. When the archdruid hits with any 
weapon, the weapon deals an extra 4d8 cold, fire, lightning, poison, or thunder damage (included in the attack), the archdruid’s choice.


ACTIONS
Multiattack. The archdruid makes three Thorned Staff or 
Nature’s Wrath attacks. It can replace one attack with a use of spellcasting. 
Thorned Staff. Melee Weapon Attack: + 7 to hit, reach 5 
ft., one target. Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) piercing damage plus 18 
(4d8) cold, fire, lightning, poison, or thunder damage (the archdruid’s choice).

speak with animals  
3/day each: heat metal , spike growth , plant growth   
(as an action), speak with plants
1/day each: polymorph , insect plague


BONUS ACTIONS
Change Shape. The archdruid magically transforms into a 
Beast that has a challenge rating no higher than its own, or 
back into its true form, which is Humanoid. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying transforms with it. It reverts to its true form if it dies. In a new form, the archdruid retains its alignment, hit points, Hit Dice, ability to speak, proficiencies, 
and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, as well 
as this bonus action. Its statistics and capabilities are otherwise replaced by those of the new form, except any class features or legendary actions of that form.


The archdruid can choose to instead magically transform
into an Elemental that has a challenge rating no higher than 6, or back into its true form. If it transforms into an Elemental, the archdruid can remain in that form for up to 6 hours then must finish a short or long rest before it can transform into an Elemental again.


BARD
The charming smile and casual pose of the musician imply 
frivolity, but as they begin to play, the music moves through the audience, stirring emotion.


Bards are traveling performers typically occupied with
entertaining audiences through a creative art of some type, such as music, oration, acting, storytelling, poetry, puppetry, verse, or song. For some bards, performance is their end goal, and they earn their living performing for audiences. Others use their skills in service of other goals, whether that be learning, travel, or even spying. 
Magical Performers. A bard’s magic is intimately tied 
to their art and their performances. Bards do not just 
cast spells, they sing, paint, or dance them. When casting spells, they turn the requisite words and movements into a 
memorable display. Without magic, a bard’s performance 
is already more than capable of evoking emotion. With magic, that same performance becomes much more 
powerful, able to move even the hardest of hearts. 
Information Collectors. Bards perform for audiences 
and many travel, playing in taverns, inns, and other places 
where people gather. This positions them well to hear 
news and gossip. Many bards already collect stories, but a truly savvy bard can have their finger on the pulse of a region simply by listening. Add to this their ability to spread information and influence attitudes through 
story and song, and it’s no wonder that some bards make 
effective spies.

Artistic Expression. The bard has one primary form of artistic 
expression, such as song, poetry, dance, fashion, paint, or 
similar. It has resistance to one type of damage associated with that artistic expression. For example, a bard expressing art through song or oration has resistance to thunder 
damage, a bard expressing art through paint has resistance 
to acid or poison damage (the bard’s choice), and a bard 
expressing art through witty discourse or clever quips has 
resistance to psychic damage. This trait can’t give the bard resistance to force, necrotic, or radiant damage.

245
APPENDIX A: SPELLCASTING NPCSExpressive Weapons. When the bard hits with any weapon, 
the weapon deals an extra 3d8 damage of the type 
determined by Artistic Expression.


ACTIONS
Multiattack. The bard makes two Rapier or Hand Crossbow 
attacks. It can replace one attack with a use of Spellcasting.  
Rapier. Melee Weapon Attack:  +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. 
Hit: 7 (1d8 + 3) piercing damage plus 13 (3d8) damage of 
the type determined by Artistic Expression. 
Hand Crossbow. Ranged Weapon Attack: + 6 to hit, range 
30/120 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage 
plus 13 (3d8) damage of the type determined by Artistic Expression. 
Dissonant Outburst (Recharge 4–6).  Each creature within 30 
feet of the bard and that can see or hear it must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 4d6 thunder damage and 2d6 psychic damage and has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until the end of its next turn. On a success, a creature takes half the 
damage and doesn’t have disadvantage on attack rolls and 
ability checks. 
Spellcasting. The bard casts one of the following spells, using 
Charisma as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 15):
At will: dancing lights , mage hand , message
3/day each: faerie fire , hold person , suggestion
1/day each: confusion , greater invisibility , scrying


BARD MAESTRO
The person takes the stage and immediately the audience hushes. 
They stand with perfect poise, as if they command the entire stage, and their voice rings out, clear, melodic, and strong.


Bard maestros are those bards who have distinguished
themselves through their skill and talent to become some of the most well-regarded musicians, poets, orators, and creators in the world. Maestros tend to be well known within bardic circles, but many are recognized in the wider world as well. Some bard maestros head bard colleges, sharing their knowledge and experience with students, while others make their living as high-paid performers in major cities, performing to audiences of hundreds or even thousands.  
Master Performers. While bard maestros specialize 
in a favored artistic form, they are typically trained in 
multiple modes of performance and a variety of musical instruments. A true maestro can perform anywhere 
and with whatever is (or isn’t) at their disposal. They 
know hundreds of songs and stories and can also create their own on the spot. The best maestros are skilled at 
reading an audience, anticipating what they want and 
gauging their response. Whether a maestro caters to that audience depends on the attitude of the maestro. Some 
maestros endeavor to please the audience, no matter 
what, some take joy in riling up an audience or presenting a performance that is both impactful and uncomfortable for the audience, and others simply prefer to preserve the 
integrity and intent of the original work, regardless of 
how the audience feels. 
Magical Influencers. Maestros have mastered the 
combination of performance and magic to influence their 
audiences, whether to aid or hinder. They can impart even simple phrases with the power to harm, accenting their 
weapon strikes. Those in the know often treat maestros 
gently, recognizing that a scorned and bitter maestro with 
a large audience could accomplish truly awe-inspiring acts.

a symbol that magically hangs in the air for a moment, performs the perfect pirouette, or gives some other short 
performance related to its Artistic Expression and chooses 
one creature it can see within 60 feet of it. If the target is 
friendly, the target gains 9 (2d8) temporary hit points until 
the start of the maestro’s next turn. If the target is hostile, 
the target must succeed on a DC 17 Charisma saving throw

Full Performance (Recharge 6). The maestro sings a melody, 
dances a short routine, or gives some other performance

1/day each: confusion , greater invisibility , scryingELEMENTALIST, PYROMANCER
A robed figure holds out its hands and fire erupts from them, 
flickering up and down the figure’s arms as a wave of heat expands around it. 
Pyromancers eschew magical versatility to focus on the power of fire. Because of fire’s destructive nature, these elementalists are often drawn to places and people that value such destruction. Some pyromancers serve a cause or organization where they can practice their magic without incurring the wrath of the law, while others study the power of fire as its own end, wishing to master 
it and understand it as best they can. Such pyromancers 
often form connections to, and seek contact with, the 
Plane of Fire. 
Creative Force. While fire can be a destructive force, 
it is also used to sustain many of the touchstones 
of civilization: cooking food, warming homes, and 
powering forges. Some pyromancers focus on this aspect of fire, studying applications that can help improve the 
lives of others.


Immutable and Uncontrollable
. The most ardent 
pyromancers maintain that fire can never be 
completely controlled and that even the most practiced 
pyromancers can only hope to direct it rather than dominate it. They caution that in addition to cultivating 
respect for fire’s power, it’s equally important to retain a 
certain level of fear.

ELEMENTALIST, FROST MAGE
A figure emerges from a snow flurry, ice covering its body atop 
pale blue robes. It raises its hand, and a shard of ice hurtles through the air. 
Frost mages devote their magical studies to the power of frost and cold, learning how to harness that power. While other elementalists focus on one element, frost mages study the conjunction of elemental water and elemental air, which some frost mages see as evidence of their superiority to other elementalists. Winter’s Bite. Frost mages adapt their abilities for 
combat, coating their bodies in a layer of rime and creating 
ice shards to defend themselves. Some frost mages can use 
their magic to alter the environment, helping or hindering the flow of troops, goods, or other travelers. 
The Coming Ice. Some frost mages believe they are 
channeling the ultimate power and that, eventually, it will dominate all. They believe in a coming ice age that will 
freeze the world. While most of these frost mages accept 
that they, too, will freeze when the ice arrives, others are convinced that when it does, they will rule. These frost 
mages actively work to bring about the ice age and to 
ensure the world descends into an age of frost.

frost to a point it can see within 60 feet of it. Each creature within 15 feet of that point must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 27 (6d8) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The ground within 15 feet of that point freezes and becomes difficult 
terrain for 1 minute.

MAGE APPRENTICE

The path to becoming a mage usually begins with
becoming a mage apprentice. Apprentices are paired with experienced mages, allowing them to learn the basics of magic and spellcasting with guidance and protection. The level of guidance and protection, however, depends greatly on the teaching mage’s attentiveness and care. An apt pupil can only prosper so much when paired with a poor teacher. 
For an apprentice, the nature of the student -teacher 
relationship greatly influences their success and ultimately their disposition. An individual may be apprenticed to one teacher mage, or they may learn from several as part of a magical school or other organization. Those who attend a magical school often have more safety in environs designed for magical experimentation, though this isn’t always the case. 
A Strict Syllabus. The lessons that a mage apprentice 
must complete often have been developed over centuries, 
passed down through magical orders with little to no change. In some cases, apprentices might find the pace 
and scope of their lessons unrelenting, and they risk 
cracking under the pressure or accidentally injuring themselves. In other cases, the lessons might seem slow and rudimentary, spurring them to study things outside 
their lessons, likely without the guidance and watchful eye 
of their teacher. 
Mostly Harmless. Mage apprentices typically have 
limited magical knowledge, but sometimes a little 
knowledge, paired with a lack of experience, can lead to danger, especially among the most ambitious apprentices. 
Aggressive rival apprentices, desperate to prove their 
superiority, might sabotage or even attack their peers. Others might stretch the boundaries of magical learning, 
reaching for powers and techniques beyond their skill. 
Many an apprentice has later regretted the summoning spell or planar magic that went awry—if they managed to 
survive the experience.

Creating Something from Nothing. Driven to push the 
limits of their knowledge and the capabilities of alchemy, 
alchemists can be found buying and selling alchemical 
wares in shops, experimenting in personal laboratories, 
or wandering the lands in search of rare ingredients. Their 
potions and unguents are often in high demand no matter 
where they find themselves.  
Mentors. Alchemy is a dangerous profession that requires 
exceptional attention to detail to survive. Few alchemists ever live to achieve mastery of their craft, and the ones 
that do are held in high esteem. It is common for master alchemists to have multiple apprentices working beneath 
them at any given moment.

ACTIONS
Multiattack. The master alchemist makes two Hasty 
Concoction attacks.Hasty Concoction. Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, 
reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 22 (4d8 + 4) 
acid, cold, fire, or poison damage (the alchemist’s choice). The concoction then causes one of the following effects of the master alchemist’s choice:
 •Disorienting Vapors. Overly sweet-smelling, pink vapors 
erupt from where the concoction hit the target. The 
target and each creature within 5 feet of it must make 
a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw. When a creature that failed this saving throw moves on its next turn, it moves 
in a random direction. To determine the direction, roll a 
d8 and assign a direction to each die face.
 •Poisonous Cloud. An acrid-smelling, green gas pours 
out from where the concoction hit the target. The gas fills 
a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on the target. The gas 
spreads around corners, and its area is lightly obscured. A creature that enters the gas for the first time on a turn or 
starts its turn there must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution 
saving throw or be poisoned until the end of its next turn. 
The gas disperses at the start of your next turn.
 •Slick Floor.  A thick, purple foam bursts out from where 
the concoction hit the target. The floor within 10 feet of the target is coated in the slick goop until the start of 
your next turn, when the foam dries. For the duration, when a creature moves through the area, it must succeed 
on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or fall prone.
When the master alchemist makes a Hasty Concoction attack, 
it can choose to target a point on the ground it can see 
within 60 feet instead. If it does so, the concoction causes only one of the above effects centered on that point instead of dealing damage.
Explosive Flask (Recharge 5–6).  The master alchemist throws 
a flask of something bubbling at a point it can see within 30 feet of it. Each creature within 10 feet of that point must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 31 (7d8) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

Dual-Specialty Focus. The theurge concentrates on two 
spells simultaneously. If it casts a third spell that requires 
concentration, the theurge loses concentration on the oldest spell. If the theurge is concentrating on two spells and loses concentration because of taking damage, it loses concentration on the oldest spell. While concentrating 
on two spells simultaneously, it has disadvantage on 
Constitution saving throws to maintain concentration.

Witches seek knowledge, power, and connection in 
their communion with nature. They cultivate their bond to these elemental and primal forces, becoming guardians at the gate, attendants of deep knowledge, 
and liaisons to a realm of immeasurable possibilities.
Nature Spirits. Witches have a deep connection 
to nature, often stemming from years of studying 
the natural world and regular communion with 
nature spirits. Their communion with such 
spirits can be a practice of utility, veneration, or 
exploitation. Some witches commune through a 
deity of magic or nature, but most prefer to commune 
with spirits directly, with wind on their face, dirt underfoot, and blood on their tongue.
Witch Implements. Witches create a variety of magical 
tools by binding spirits into objects. The implements a 
witch chooses to use often reflect the kinds of powers or spells the witch favors.

Witch Implements. The witch carries several items imbued 
with the spirits of nature. At the start of each of its turns, the 
witch chooses two of the following implements to be active until the start of its next turn:
 •Book.  While this implement is active, the witch can 
read and understand any language, and the witch has 
advantage on Constitution saving throws to maintain 
concentration on a spell.
 •Broom. While this implement is active, the witch has a 
flying speed of 30 feet. If the witch is flying and doesn’t 
choose to keep this implement active at the start of its 
next turn, the witch falls up to 60 feet, landing on its  
feet and taking no falling damage when it lands. If the witch doesn’t land after it falls 60 feet, it falls the remaining distance, taking falling damage and landing 
prone, as normal. 
 •Candle. While this implement is active, the witch has 
darkvision out to a range of 60 feet, and magical darkness doesn’t impede the witch’s darkvision.
 •Chime. While this implement is active, a hostile creature 
that starts its turn within 30 feet of the witch must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be unable 
to move closer to the witch. Aberrations, Celestials, Elementals, Fey, Fiends, and Undead have disadvantage 
on the saving throw.

DEEP MAGIC VOLUME 2Appendix B:


This appendix contains guidance on how to convert any
5th Edition spell into one of the four circles of magic used 
in the T ales of the V aliant roleplaying game and the Core Fantasy Roleplaying engine.


Circles of Magic
All magic requires energy. The four circles of magic represent the four primary sources of magical energy 
that fuel the abilities of spellcasters. When a spellcaster 
produces a spell, the caster taps into one of these energies 
using magical training, natural abilities, personal inclinations, or innate connections with magical entities. The section below details the four circles of magic and 
explains their roles in spellcasting.


ARCANE CIRCLE
The Arcane Circle of magic draws its power from the 
manipulation of forces that govern the material world, like heat, space, and gravity. In the hands of an arcane caster, the precise combination of words and gestures can ignite oxygen into roaring flame or link two pieces of land 
hundreds of miles apart. Arcane magic is governed by an 
extensive set of rules and calculations that make it highly 
complex. This complexity at times makes arcane magic more closely resemble science than mystical workings. Harnessing magic from this circle requires study, 
precision, and a talent for perfection.


The tools that define arcane magical working are varied
and often highly personal to the arcane caster. The most 
common tools are runes, recitation, and hand gestures, but anything that engages the senses can be used. Casting arcane magic is only limited by imagination and an 
understanding of the formulaic laws of magic. Conversion. When converting standard 5th Edition 
spells into the circles of magic, the following qualities 
typically indicate a spell belongs in the Arcane Circle:
• The spell detects, suppresses, ends, or otherwise interacts with the mechanical aspects of spellcasting.
• The spell harnesses elemental energy.
• The spell interacts with the five senses, whether to fool them or to extend their powers beyond typical 
capabilities.


DIVINE CIRCLE
The Divine Circle of magic draws its power from the 
connectivity that exists between beings. A divine caster 
can imbue a dying creature with the will to live again, 
channel the wrath of a divine being into a storm of fire, or miraculously restore the crops of a starving community. Whatever the specific effect, divine magic requires a connection between the will of the caster and at least one other being to function. Harnessing magic from this circle requires unwavering devotion, hyper-awareness of others, and belief in your ability to change the world.


The use of divine magic is often framed through the
concept of faith, where an individual enacts the will of a mighty being known as a god. While this relationship 
between caster and god is the most common model, it 
isn’t required to fuel divine magic. The Divine Circle 
draws energy just as potently for a caster who devotes themselves entirely to a community’s needs, an evil coda set forth by a cult, or any other compelling source. 
Wherever need exists, there is the potential for divine 
magic. Casting divine magic is always done in the service 
of others, regardless of the morality of the caster.


Spell Conversion
253
APPENDIX B: TALES OF THE VALIANT SPELL CONVERSIONConversion. When converting standard 5th Edition 
spells into the circles of magic, the following qualities 
typically indicate a spell belongs in the Divine Circle:
• The spell specifically interacts with another creature’s life force, whether to heal, harm, or imbue with undeath.
• The spell specifies interaction with a deity or includes the word faith in the description.


PRIMORDIAL CIRCLE
The Primordial Circle of magic draws its power from the primal energies of nature. A primordial caster can cause a forest to sprout from barren land, spur the rapid decay of flesh, or instantly restructure their biology to transform into a beast. Primordial magic redirects the forces of nature in accordance with the spellcaster’s will. The Primordial Circle doesn’t concern itself with creating new things but rather alters the energy already present in the environment to enact startling or subtle effects. Harnessing magic from this circle requires great awareness of the environment, extensive knowledge of the building blocks of life, and deep respect for the power inherent in nature.
The use of primordial magic always requires a source. 
Creating a primordial magical effect can be defined by how a caster interacts with energy that is present in the environment, whether amplifying, suppressing, altering, redirecting, or encouraging. A primordial caster understands that there is a finite amount of energy in the natural universe, and this magic concerns itself with tipping the scales of balance in just the right ways to enact the spellcaster’s will. Primordial magic always draws from nature itself and can’t be accessed without placing its interests first. 
Conversion. When converting standard 5th Edition 
spells into the circles of magic, the following qualities typically indicate a spell belongs in the Primordial Circle:
• The spell alters or enhances a creature’s biological characteristics.
• The spell specifically interacts with plants or beasts.
• The spell replicates an effect that could possibly occur as a natural phenomenon, such as fog or an earthquake.


WYRD CIRCLE
The Wyrd Circle of magic draws its power from the forces that sit beyond the material world. A wyrd caster can draw unnatural energy into existence to form a mass of writhing tendrils, summon another creature from a different plane to fight on their behalf, or banish their foes to the spinning void beyond reality. Harnessing wyrd magic requires spellcasters to free their minds from normal perceptions and open themselves to the possibilities of what lies beyond the measurable universe.


The use of wyrd magic requires a caster to become
a conduit. The caster is the material anchor that calls unnatural energies into the world, then shapes those energies into the desired effect. Dealing with such bizarre forces antithetical to natural law is incredibly dangerous for a spellcaster, and tapping such powers usually requires the spellcaster to call on the assistance of beings familiar with the unfamiliar. Such spellcasters often forge pacts with extraplanar beings or invite spirits that dwell beyond the natural world into their bodies to interact with wyrd powers while shielding themselves from total ruin. Wyrd magic always breaks reality or the physical world to allow the forces from beyond to creep in. 
Conversion. When converting standard 5th Edition 
spells into the circles of magic, the following qualities typically indicate a spell belongs in the Wyrd Circle:
• The spell summons a creature from a different plane or realm of existence.
• The spell harnesses energy that is not elemental in nature.
• The spell allows travel between different planes of existence.


Mul ti-Circle Spells
The guidance here gives suggestions for converting 5th 
Edition spells into circles of magic, but many spells possess the qualities of multiple circles. So, what do we do then? In those cases, the spell simply belongs to multiple circles. Spellcasters trained in different circles might access and use magical energy in different ways, but they often seek to cause the same or similar effects. Because of this, the way individual spellcasters use or cast a spell that belongs to multiple circles might be different, depending on the circle that gives that particular spellcaster access to the spell. 
For example, the detect poison and disease spell belongs to 
both the Divine and Primordial circles. A divine spellcaster using the spell intuitively understands the target’s lifeforce is in danger and knows the danger is posed by a poison or disease. A primordial spellcaster using the spell understands the target’s natural rhythm is out of balance and can feel the unbalancing rhythm of the poison or disease as it courses through the target’s body.
As another example, the spider climb spell belongs to both 
the Arcane and Primordial circles. An arcane spellcaster using the spell might change their personal static electricity 
to better cling to surfaces, while a primordial spellcaster might rearrange their physiology to gain spider-like qualities that allow for clinging to surfaces.

DEEP MAGIC VOLUME 2Appendix C: Magical Random Tables


This appendix provides a variety of random
tables you can use to enhance the role of magic in your adventures. Magical Effect Descriptions
Y ou can use this table and a d20 to quickly roll up a sensory 
effect for your spell or spell-like ability to provide a unique, 
narrative flair. Alternatively, you can refer to this table by the 
school column to enrich your game with consistent effects for 
spells of that particular type.


MAGICAL DESCRIPTIONS
d20 School Magical Description
1 Abjuration In certain light, the affected target almost seems to have a dragon, fish, or lizard-scale pattern across its form. If struck, the pattern becomes momentarily visible as it flares in response.
2 Abjuration A translucent but visibly iridescent sheen covers the targeted area, its surface gently rippling like a river’s surface.
3 Abjuration Arcane runes, angelic seals, or sacred geometry float just a few inches off the targeted area. They are invisible to the naked eye but appear vividly if touched by something magical or 
viewed through some other type of sight like darkvision.
4 Conjuration Evidence of the created effect coalesces along the surface of the target, hinting at its true 
origin, such as lava-like cracks if it is from a fiery demiplane, flaking brimstone if is infernal, tiny tendrils of smoke if it is infused with shadowy elements, and similar effects.
5 Conjuration The initial effect leaves an imprint on the ground where it originated, scorching or rejuvenating vegetation, churning the soil, leaving cracks in stone, or creating small puddles of oil or water.
6 Conjuration The air around the object or target feels full with an inappropriate aroma for the current environment, such as the smell of petrichor on a sunny day, burnt toast with no flame or food nearby, or freshly dug loam.  
7 Divination Lights and flames flicker as if under a strong wind during the effect, and a faint tickling at the ear suggests an intangible force might be trying to communicate though nothing is actually audibly heard.
8 Divination The smell of rubbed tea leaves permeates the area within 15 feet of the effect.
9 Enchantment The eyes of the affected target glow with a pale green or pink light. If the target is an object, its form shifts slightly so that it appears as if it had a face if it doesn’t already and the eye-like features glow with the same light.
10 Enchantment The affected target occasionally jerks or develops small tics, as if it was a puppet on the end of a string.
11 Evocation Strong vibrations within 30 feet of the target or area rattle loose objects and shake structures at their foundations.
12 Evocation An audible popping sound that is felt as much as heard precipitates the effect.
13 Evocation Remnants of the effect harmlessly coarse along the caster’s body and around the impact area of the spell, alluding to the discharged damage type, such as floating cinders, sizzling pockmarks from acid, or the tinkling of tiny, piercing nettles.
14 Illusion The edges of the effect shimmer in barely perceptible waves, like hot stone on a blistering summer day.

this potion to push and pull at your features, knead your skin into a different color or pattern, and apply cosmetic 
changes before the effects set and become semi-permanent. This potion can’t add what isn’t already there or take 
away a key feature such as an eye or ear. This altered appearance then lasts for up to 1d10 days or can be cured with a 
regenerate spell. 
2 Drake’s Nose. Uncommon. Drinking this smoky potion gives you Greed Sense up to 60 feet, allowing you to 
innately sense the existence of precious metals and rare gemstones. Y ou know the general direction of such items 
and can determine their relative size, but you can’t sense their precise location or exact worth. This effect lasts for 8 hours.
3 Mephit’s Talent. Uncommon. Drinking this potion causes you to be immune to a random damage type. Roll a d6 to determine the type: 1 for acid, 2 for cold, 3 for fire, 4 for lightning, 5 for poison, and 6 for thunder. For 1 minute, at the start of each of your turns, you explode. Each creature within 10 feet of you must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or take 2d6 damage of the type to which you are made immune by this potion.
4 Hirsute. Uncommon. This potion has a fuzzy texture when you drink it. Drinking it instantly causes your hair to grow 1d6 inches, but it makes your breath smell particularly bad for 1d4 days.
5 Oil of Stickiness. Uncommon. For the next 8 hours, you stick to anything you touch. Whenever you grip, touch with your bare skin, or otherwise physically contact an object or creature, you must succeed on a DC 17 Strength check or become stuck to the surface. Y ou can escape this effect by taking an action and succeeding on a Strength check. If your hands are stuck in this way, you might have difficulty casting spells with somatic or material components or 
using or activating objects, at the GM’s discretion. Alternatively, this failed potion can be poured on the ground as 
an action, where it covers a 10-foot square and duplicates the effect of an entangle spell for 8 hours.
6 Instant Horns. Uncommon. Drinking this stinky potion causes you to immediately grow a pair of mammalian, 
reptilian, or insectile horns that remain for 24 hours. This process is painful, dealing 1d4 piercing damage to you, 
but the horns are natural melee weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. When you hit with your 
horns, your horns deal piercing damage equal to 1d8 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage 
normal for an unarmed strike. When this effect ends, the horns fall off, and the cavities they leave behind take 1d10 days to scab over and heal. Alternatively, the cavities can be healed by a regenerate spell. 
7 Renewal. Rare. When you imbibe this light, bubbly concoction, you immediately regain 1 expended use of a class feature of your choice as if you fulfilled the short or long rest requirement for doing so.
8 Deep Seeing. Rare. Drinking this slippery potion causes you to grow a third eye in the middle of your forehead. With this eye, you can see through stone, wood, and metal (but not lead) up to 10 inches thick. This effect lasts for 10 minutes, after which your new eye atrophies and falls out of your head. The cavity it leaves behind takes 1d10 days to scab over and heal. Alternatively, the cavity can be healed by a regenerate spell.
9 Distilled Hate. Rare. This viscous potion is brewed with extreme prejudice and reagents sourced from a reviled creature. When you drink it, you gain a favored enemy (as the ranger class feature) chosen at the time the potion is brewed. In addition, when you hit a favored enemy of yours with an attack, you deal extra damage to the target equal to your proficiency bonus. This effect lasts for 8 hours, after which you immediately suffer 1 level of 
exhaustion that can be cured only through a lesser restoration or greater restoration spell or by imbibing another potion 
of distilled hate.
10 Liquid Arcana. Very Rare. This bright blue beverage is prized by spellcasters everywhere. Drinking it allows you to 
regain 1d4 + 1 expended spell slots. Y ou can regain a number of 1st-level spell slots equal to that amount, or the spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than that amount. For example, if your result was a 3, you could regain one 3rd-level spell slot, or a 2nd-level spell slot and a 1st-level spell slot, or three 1st-level spell slots.


POTION FAILURE EFFECTSPotion Effects and Failures
These tables contain unique effects that happen when a creature drinks a potion or uses an oil. The potion 
failures table represents such effects that come about from the botched or incomplete creation of a potion.
258
DEEP MAGIC VOLUME 2d10 Potion Failure Effect
1 Spoiled. Any numerical effects the potion causes when consumed are halved. In addition, you must succeed on a 
DC 14 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1 hour.
2 Stone Shake. Y ou begin to turn to stone over the course of 1d10 days, becoming petrified at the end of the 
duration unless you find a cure. While turning to stone, you have resistance to bludgeoning, slashing, and piercing damage from nonmagical weapons, your speed is halved, and you have disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws and ability checks.
3 Kobold Strength. Y ou lose significant physical power as your muscles temporarily shrink. For 1 hour, your 
Strength score becomes the lesser of 7 (−2) or your normal Strength score.
4 Bothersome Humors. The potion causes uncontrollable bouncing, humming, vibrating, hiccupping, or some 
other physical repetition. Y ou have disadvantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Charisma ability checks for the next 24 hours or until you are the target of a lesser restoration spell or similar magic. 
5 Accidental Infatuation. When you drink this potion, in addition to its intended effects, you also are charmed by the next person you see. This condition persists for 1 hour and can be removed only with a wish spell. 
6 Oil of Dullness. This failed potion ruins the edges of weapons. Applying it to one slashing or piercing weapon or up to 5 pieces of ammunition causes the coated item to have a −3 penalty to attack and damage rolls for 1 minute. Alternatively, if you let this oil touch your skin or you ingest it, it absorbs quickly and causes you to have disadvantage on Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws and ability checks for the next 24 hours or until you are the target of a lesser restoration spell or similar magic. 
7 Animal Animosity. Y ou give off a smell, posture, or aura that agitates nearby animals. For 1 hour, Beasts are drawn to you, going out of their way to harm or harry you with extreme hostility.
8 Visibility. Y ou become hyper-visible as your skin takes on a neon,  luminescent tint that catches and reflects light. For 10 minutes, you can’t  
benefit from invisibility, you have disadvantage on Dexterity  
(Stealth) checks, and attacks against you are made with  advantage, provided the attacker can see you.
9 Truth Serum. Y ou are unable to lie for the next 24 hours.  In addition, you become prone to uncontrollable  outbursts, and periodically, you must succeed on a  
DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or loudly voice how  you’re feeling, what you’re thinking, or otherwise  have some other truthful outburst.
10 Harmful Appearance. Y our skin erupts  with colorful spots, stripes, welts, or pustules.  For 1 hour, you have vulnerability to a type of  damage related to the color of the blemish.  Roll a d10 to determine the color and damage  type: 1 chartreuse and acid, 2 blue and cold,  3 red and fire, 4 purple and force,  5 yellow and lightning, 6 black and necrotic,  
7 green and poison, 8 pink and psychic,  9 orange and radiant, 10 gray and thunder.

REVERSE SUMMONING QUEST PLOT HOOKS
d12 Plot Hook
1 Y ou are transported into the lair of a terrific and uncharacteristically polite ancient copper dragon named Tyricratoryx. The dragon has grown bored of its hoard and tasks you with furnishing a new collection to liven up the space. The catch? The dragon desires one specimen of every known potion recipe.
2 Ellivia Wildecrow (she prefers Livi), daughter of Malyn Wildecrow the Anointed, reads from the Five Oathwrit T exts of Hedren to summon your presence. She needs you to retrieve her cat, Mr. Mittinz, from the lower branches of an ancient, magical tree connected to the fey realm.
3 Y ou receive a courtly summons from the local realm’s regent. They need you to swiftly clear out the east wing of their palace or estate so that it may be renovated in time for a grand ball at the end of the week. The catch? The previous arcane advisor failed to clean up their runic wards and golem experiments before their disappearance 
following a fey boundary dispute.
4 Y ou are conjured by accident into the summoning circle of the arch lich Kayne Fellmarke. Hey, even great and 
all-powerful wizards have off days. Once the lich gets over the error, he agrees to let you go but not before you handle an errand for him. Bury his backup phylactery in a random place and return to him afterward to have your memory wiped. He then puts a geas on you to ensure your compliance.
5 Minor devils Kezrach and Axurgemen bind you to their infernal realm. Y ou can leave once you help them by mediating their contract dispute. They wouldn’t normally even consider mortal help in a matter like this, but it involves a mortal warlock who agreed to conflicting pact contracts with both devils.
6 By the will of Scaldris the Heated, fire elemental of the City of Brass and T orchbearer of the Scorching Ray, you are summoned and thusly commanded. Assist your new master in its quest to prove to the efreeti lords of the city that it is the hottest elemental this side of the Elemental Plane of Fire.
7 The angel Domiel interrupts your morning plans by summoning you to the gilded halls of the heavens. They have a task that requires a mortal’s touch. Attempt a heist for Mathelzor’s Twin Slumbering Scrolls to ensure the nearby angelic vault is both fiend and mortal-proof.
8 Naevyn Devilfriend the Branded brings you into her inner sanctum. She has a request and offers to return the favor with applied divinations. All you have to do is publicly discredit her rival, Iyrras Shadowhand, by exposing him for the necromancer he obviously is. Shortly thereafter, Iyrras summons you to his own inner sanctum and politely asks you to expose Naevyn for illegally consorting with fiends.
9 Y ou are summoned by a desperate and clearly sleepless warlock who introduces himself as Aenor the Fiery. He begs for your aid in helping him look good on “just a little quest” to retrieve the Baleful Stone of Jerilyn. Aenor’s infernal benefactor won’t stop “hover-patroning,” and the warlock really needs a win.
10 Y ou are conjured before the steps of the Netherveil Library, a repository lost to time and civilization. The 
Sentient Codex of Caligan, a tome of forgotten lore, has summoned you for assistance. Please kindly replace 
the Codex on the proper shelf within the library. It’s been ages since the tome was taken out and no one is left to 
mind the books.
11 Cornelia Brightbourne the Relentless has manifested your presence. She is free today and wants to know if you would like to go birdwatching with her. She has spare field guides for everyone and will offer a prize for whomever spots the most different species.
12 Y ou appear within the dank kobold warren of Clan Pebblefang. They need last-minute babysitters for their 3d10 + 3 pups while the adults all go raiding on the neighboring goblin horde two caves over. Make sure all the pups practice their trap building, eat dinner without making a mess, take their baths, and go to bed on time, and you will be justly paid for your time and effort, including a share of the raid spoils. The kobold seer that summoned you promises to check in throughout the night via message.

this pair of rooms.
Combat. An ink guardian (see Creature Codex) explodes 
from one of the bottles to attack the intruders.Social. A harried alchemist arrived at work only to find

to explode.
Exploration. The PCs discover a set of cryptic notes 
about how to brew an important potion, solution, or 
antidote. They must make a series of checks to find the 
ingredients they need amidst the room’s storage cabinets,

invisible force.


Here are suggestions of encounters that might occur in
this room.
Elemental Node: Air
Combat. One or more air elementals form from the 
clouds to attack anyone on the central platform.
Exploration. The key required to leave this room (or

ship surrounded by an endless expanse of inky space. A golden 
astrolabe bolted to the deck subtly shifts and spins, reflecting the 
dizzying patterns of stars that punctuate the void beyond.


Here are suggestions of encounters that might occur in
this room.Combat. A void dragon wyrmling or young void 
dragon (see T ome of Beasts) is hiding in the hull of the ship 
(which is accessible only by climbing down and under the prow). The dragon waits for the right opportunity before launching an attack—in hopes of claiming the PCs’ gear for its nest.
Exploration. PCs who examine the astrolabe notice it is 
out of alignment with the constellations visible in the void beyond. If the PCs figure out how to correctly realign the astrolabe, a secret panel opens, revealing a key or treasure.
269

in this room. An eerie whistle sound from the chimney is the only 
noise that punctuates the oppressive silence.


Here are suggestions of encounters that might occur in
this pair of rooms.
Combat. Several objects in the room animate to attack 
intruders. Use stat blocks like animated armor, flying swords, or animated instruments (see T ome of Beasts 3).Combat. A vampire spawn, vampire patrician (see

Haunted Studio Salon Exploration. When the PCs enter the room, a haunting 
melody comes from the piano. If the PCs successfully 
replicate the song (either on the piano or other instruments), a secret door opens in the fireplace.
Social. When a PC nears the mirror in the corner of 
the salon, a ghostly person appears instead of the PC’s reflection. The ghost asks the PCs to bury its remains to allow it eternal rest. The remains are in the ashes in the study’s fireplace.Social. A disheveled human sits behind the desk in the 
study, scribbling frantically on paper. After a moment, the scribbling stops, then the paper is crumbled and tossed toward the fireplace. When the PCs enter, the writer perks up, hoping for new inspiration. If the PCs help the writer with writer’s block, they are rewarded with a rare magic item.

this room.
Combat. If the PCs touch or otherwise disturb the 
shrine, the vines in the room slither together to form an 
enraged shambling mound.Exploration. Any effort to investigate the room reveals

understands Druidic reads the words aloud, the shrine summons a friendly sprite who willingly serves that PC for the next hour.
Social. A junior druid sits at the foot of the shrine, 
trying to encourage a potted seed to sprout. If the PCs help the druid (such as with magic or gardening advice), the druid rewards the PCs with the potted plant. After 14 days, it grows into a miniature bush and produces two goodberry berries at dawn each day.
273
APPENDIX D: ARCANE ADVENTURE SITES


Library Stacks Library
Floating lanterns cast a soft orang glow on the floor-to-ceiling 
bookshelves that line the walls of this carpeted room. Desks fill the 
connected scriptorium, where an ancient podium stands on a dais 
worn by centuries of footsteps.


Here are suggestions of encounters that might occur in
this pair of rooms.
Combat. If any of the PCs touch or otherwise disturb the 
books in this room, one or more paper golem swarms 
(see Creature Codex) emerge from hiding and attack.Combat. Summoned here by foolish students long 
ago, a barbed devil stalks the scriptorium. It is magically bound to the chamber and can’t leave, but it attacks any who enter.
Exploration. If the PCs take time to search the shelves 
of the library, they find a treatise on a magical style (see Chapter 2). The treatise doesn’t contain spells, but it contains descriptions of the style and plenty of guidance for a PC interested in adopting that style.
274
DEEP MAGIC VOLUME 2
Library Scriptorium Exploration. The scriptorium contains enough ink, 
quills, parchment, and other basic materials to create a set 
of calligrapher’s supplies or a forgery kit.
Social. A group of acolytes or mage apprentices 
(see Appendix A) heatedly argue magical theory in the scriptorium, while their young mage professor frantically tries to get the students back on track and paying attention to the lecture.

from behind the central desk. If they investigate, they find a devasted librarian who begs the party to retrieve several valuable tomes that were stolen by other denizens of the structure where this library exists. 
Social. In the scriptorium, the PCs come across a young, 
unarmed goblin stuffing scrolls into its robes. The goblin has some magical talent and has been sneaking in and stealing scrolls to learn better control of magic. The goblin promises to return the scrolls if the PCs promise not to tell the owner of the scriptorium.
275
APPENDIX D: ARCANE ADVENTURE SITES
Necromancers Lab Work Room Necromancer’s Laboratory


The stench of chemicals and the sickly smell of rot fill this
disturbing set of rooms. Filled specimen jars, piles of fresh ash, 
and barrels of blood-crusted bones hint at the macabre events 
that transpire here.


Here are suggestions of encounters that might occur in
this pair of rooms.Combat. A mage or necromancer (see Creature Codex) 
lurks behind one of the room’s worktables under the effects 
of a greater invisibility spell. If threatened, the spellcaster commands several skeletons or zombies hidden in the refuse barrels to spring forth and attack the party.

work room with a silver dagger sticking out from its leg. If the dagger is removed, a burst of lightning courses through the golem, causing it to arise and attack the intruders.
276
DEEP MAGIC VOLUME 2
Necromancers Lab Subject Cages Exploration. A severed hand in a bucket in the room 
wears a signet ring of a local noble. The hand once 
belonged to one of the noble’s relatives who went missing 
weeks ago. The noble pays the PCs handsomely for the 
return of the ring and information regarding the fate of its owner.
Exploration. One of the cages in the subject cages 
room holds a trio of colorful birds. They are a rare breed of poultry touched by fey magic, making their feathers prized as spell components. When used as a spell component to cast the gentle repose spell, the feather doubles the spell’s duration.
Social. A distressed ghost haunts this room. The ghost 
is not interested in attacking anyone other than the necromancer responsible for its death, but it begs the PCs to find an important memento that is on its corpse—which the ghost senses is hidden somewhere in the lab.

line the walls of this room. A circular stone gateway carved with 
arcane symbols stands against the far wall.


Here are suggestions of encounters that might occur in
this room.

satarre mystics (see T ome of Beasts 2) emerge from the portal just as the PCs enter. The satarre demand total 
compliance with whatever they ask of the party and attack any who refuse their requests. 
Exploration. PCs who investigate the crystals on 
the wall realize they change colors when touched. By activating the correct crystals with the correct colors, the party can cause the portal to open, allowing access to a previously inaccessible part of the structure where this portal exists or to some other key location. 
278
DEEP MAGIC VOLUME 2


Ritual ChamberRitual Chamber

of this room. Neat racks of scrolls stand against the walls.


Here are suggestions of encounters that might occur in
this room.
Combat. The chamber is currently in use by a group of 
cultists and cult fanatics. Most of them move to attack 
the party, but a few continue their ritual. If these cultists 
aren’t interrupted, a bearded devil or other fiend is 
summoned at the start of the second round of combat.Exploration. Any PCs who step into the metal circles 
are immediately trapped by a magic circle spell and an audible alarm starts to ring. The rest of the party has 10 minutes to free the trapped PCs before the creature who set the trap arrives to deal with the intruders.
Social. A wounded deva, trapped in the form of a fox, 
sits in the center of the room’s magic circle. It begs the PCs to disrupt the magic runes binding it. If they do, it heals them or grants them a minor divine blessing. 
279
APPENDIX D: ARCANE ADVENTURE SITES


Theurgic Sanctum Meditation Room Theurgic Sanctum
Soft tapestries and the smell of incense cast an aura of tranquility 
over this set of rooms. Curious objects patterned with swirling 
geometric symbols drift around the space.


Here are suggestions of encounters that might occur in
this pair of rooms.
Social. The sanctum is occupied by a theurge (see 
Appendix A) who is willing to give the party shelter and information if any of the characters can beat them in a 
game of chess (or other suitable game with a gaming set). Combat. A group of cultists sit on cushions, listening to 
their theurge (see Appendix A) leader, who speaks in the center of the room. The group attacks any intruders on their private meeting, determined to not let any knowledge of their clandestine meeting escape the room.
Combat. When the PCs enter the mithraeum, the orrery 
in the center of the room whirs and spins, creating a portal at its center. An animal-shaped creature made of starlight (use the statistics of a fire elemental, except the creature is immune to and deals radiant damage instead of fire damage) steps from the portal and attacks the intruders.
280
DEEP MAGIC VOLUME 2
Theurgic Sanctum Mithraeum Exploration. Although the stars that make up the 
constellations on the floor of the mithraeum all glow 
softly, one start in each constellation glows brighter than the others. If a PC touches each of the bright stars, the orrery in the center of the room springs to life, planets and moons spinning around the center. After a moment, the center device falls away, revealing a hidden passage, hidden treasure, or other secret. Exploration. Examining the contents of the room 
reveals several magical orbs marked with constellations of various animals. A PC that activates an orb receives the magical benefit of the enhance ability spell associated with the orb’s animal for the next hour (only one orb can be active on any one character at a time).
281
APPENDIX D: ARCANE ADVENTURE SITES


Warlock Lair Dark Altar Warlock Lair

sludge at the center of this room. Sounds of metallic rattling and 
scraping come from the chamber downstairs.


Here are suggestions of encounters that might occur in
this pair of rooms.
Combat. One or more black puddings live in the sludge at 
the base of the altar and climb out to attack any intruders.Combat. One or more otyughs smash through the 
gridded grate in the floor to attack the party—at your 
discretion, they may cease their attack if provided with a more suitable meal.
Exploration. The altar in this room was a hastily 
repurposed shrine to a benevolent deity, a fact made clear by old, worn inscriptions on the altar’s base. If the PCs destroy the statue and spend 1 hour cleaning or purifying the pool of corrupted water, each participating PC is granted a divine boon appropriate to the deity.
282
DEEP MAGIC VOLUME 2
Warlock Lair Sacrifice Pit Exploration. The sacrifice pit contains bioluminescent 
crystals growing from the remains of victims of the pit. 
The glow of each crystal pulses like a heartbeat, and the pulsing glow of a crystal changes to match the heartbeat of any creature holding it.
Social. A master alchemist (see Appendix A) sits in one 
of the cages near the sacrifice pit, asking to be released. The alchemist vengeance against the owner of the structure where this pit is located and aids the PCs, if their goals align.Social. The eerie statue contains the trapped spirit of 
a horned devil. As soon as the PCs enter the room, the devil telepathically reaches out to them, urging them to free him by performing a blood sacrifice. In exchange, the devil reveals the location of a secret door in the structure where this room exists or hands over a rare magic item. Performing the ritual requires 1 hour and spilling all the blood in one Medium creature’s body.

APPENDIX D: ARCANE ADVENTURE SITES
Witches Den Potion BreweryWitch’s Den
A mélange of spicy scents waft from the bubbling cauldron at the 
center of this room. A gentle breeze from the adjacent garden stirs 
the leaves of the potted plants that line the walls.


Here are suggestions of encounters that might occur in
this pair of rooms.
Combat. One or more of the potted plants are disguised 
razorleafs (see Creature Codex) that attack the intruders. Combat. Several steam mephits lounge in the natural 
hot spring in the center of the divination grove. If the PCs 
enter the room not accompanied by the mephits’ witch mistress, they attack the intruders.
Exploration. The witch’s potion brewery contains 
enough tools to create a set of alchemist’s supplies or an herbalism kit. If a PC that isn’t injured takes these tools or kit out of the den, the witch that resides in the den discovers the theft later that day and seeks the return of the stolen goods.

DEEP MAGIC VOLUME 2
Witches Den Divination Grove Exploration. The warmth of the steam from the natural 
hot spring in the center of the divination grove and the 
sweet smell of the flowers make the PCs drowsy. PCs that complete a short rest in the area experience divinatory visions about their upcoming tasks, gaining advantage on one attack roll, ability check, or saving throw of their choice that occurs within the next hour.Social. A dryad tends its bonded and ailing sapling in 
the divination grove. If the PCs appear amicable, the dryad asks them to retrieve a special flower in another part of the structure where this area is located. If the PCs do so, the dryad uses the flower to cure the ailing sapling then rewards the PCs with a rare magic item.
Social. The witch (see Appendix A) who dwells here 
has a variety of magic potions and salves available for purchase. The witch is happy to sell their wares, but the prices aren’t set in coin.

Wizard Duelling Room Wizard’s  Dueling Room


Tiered wooden benches sit against the parallel walls of this long
hall, giving spectators a perfect view of the decorative rectangular 
strip that bisects the room.


Here are suggestions of encounters that might occur in
this room.Combat. An inactive shield guardian stands on the far 
edge of the dueling stage. If any PCs touch the stage or 
the guardian, it activates and challenges the PC with the highest Strength score to a one-on-one duel. If the PCs refuse, the shield guardian pursues the party relentlessly until it is slain, or someone agrees to fight it.
Social. Stepping into the room triggers a programmed 
illusion of a crowd of onlookers and a duelist. If the PCs “play along” and fight the illusory duelist (which can’t actually harm them), the crowd cheers wildly then disappears, leaving real gold coins in their place.
