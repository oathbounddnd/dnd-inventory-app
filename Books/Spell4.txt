ON THE ALT-COVER
Artist Wylie Beckert shows Tasha conjuring images of her 
past and future, wielding an incantation taught by her 
mother, Baba Yaga, while the abyssal lord Graz'zt looks on. 
Disclaimer: Contained herein are the observations of the archmage Tasha. Later known as 
the Witch Queen and then lggwi/v, she is one of the greatest wizards in the history of the 
multiverse. We fear there is an incantation hidden within these notes and have therefore 
bound this tome with powerful wards. If you are reading this, the first ward has a/ready 
been broken! If you dare read any further, we cannot guarantee the safety of your soul or 
that yotJ won't open a portal to another plane of existence. If a portal does appear, pray 
that nothing worse than Tasha's mother Baba Yoga appears. And if the mother of hags ar­
rives, be sure to offer only praises of her daughter. Or offer muffins. She loves muffins.

USING THIS BOOK
Tasha's Cauldron of Everything offers a host of new 
options for DUNGEONS & DRAGONS, and our journey 
through those options is accompanied by the notes 
of the wizard Tasha. Creator of the spell Tasha's hid­
eous laughter, Tasha's life is one of the most storied 
in the D&D multiverse. Raised by Baba Yaga, the 
Mother of Witches herself, Tasha adventured across 
the world of Greyhawk and became the friend and 
sometimes enemy of other famous adventurers, 
like Mordenkainen. In time, she ruled as the Witch


Queen and later changed her name to lggwilv-a
figure of legend who is whispered about, feared, 
and admired. 
Written for players and Dungeon Masters alike, 
this book offers options to enhance characters and 
campaigns in any D&D world, whether you're adven­
turing in Greyhawk, another official D&D setting, or 
a world of your own creation.


WHAT You'LL FIND WITHIN
Chapter 1 brims with new features and subclasses 
for the classes in the Player's Handbook. and it 
presents the artificer class, a master of magical 
invention. The chapter also offers feats for groups 
that use them. 
Chapter 2 contains patrons who can become one of 
the driving forces behind your group's adventures. 
Chapter 3 sparkles with new magical options, in­
cluding spells, magical spellbooks, artifacts, and 
magic-infused tattoos-a vailable for both player 
characters and monsters to use. 
Chapter 4 holds various rules that a DM may incor­
porate into a campaign, including rules on side­
kicks who level up with the player characters and 
on supernatural environments. The chapter ends 
with a collection of puzzles ready to be deployed in 
any adventure that the DM would like to spice up 
with some puzzling.


IT'S ALL OPTIONAL
Everything in this book is optional. Each group, 
guided by the DM, decides which of these options, 
if any, to incorporate into a campaign. You can use 
some, all, or none of them. We encourage you to 
choose the ones that fit best with your campaign's 
story and with your_ group's style of play. 
Whatever options you choose to use, this book re­
lies on the rules in the Player's Handbook, Monster 
Manual, and Dungeon Master's Guide, and it can be 
paired with the options in Xanathar's Guide to Ev­
erything and other D&D books. 
4 USING THIS BOOK I


UN EART HED ARC ANA
Much of the material in this book originally appeared 
in Unearthed Arcana, a series of online articles we 
publish to explore rules that might officially become 
part of the game. Some Unearthed Arcana offerings 
don't end up resonating with fans and are set aside. 
The Unearthed Arcana material that inspired the op­
tions in the following chapters was well received and, 
thanks to feedback from thousands of D&D fans, has 
been refined into the official forms presented here.


TEN RULES TO REMEMBER
1. THE DM ADJUDICATES THE RULES 
The rules of D&D cover many of the twists and 
turns that come up in play, but the possibilities are 
so vast that the rules can't cover everything. When 
you encounter something that the rules don't cover 
or if you're unsure how to interpret a rule, the DM 
decides how to proceed, aiming for a course that 
brings the most enjoyment to your whole group. 
2. EXCEPTIONS SUPERSEDE GENERAL RULES 
General rules govern each part of the game. For ex­
ample, the combat rules tell you that melee weapon 
attacks use Strength and ranged weapon attacks 
use Dexterity. That's a general rule, and a general 
rule is in effect as long as something in the game 
doesn't explicitly say otherwise. 
The game also includes elements-class features, 
spells, magic items, monster abilities, and the like­
that sometimes contradict a general rule. When an 
exception and a general rule disagree, the exception 
wins. For example, if a feature says you can make 
melee weapon attacks using your Charisma, you 
can do so, even though that statement disagrees 
with the general rule. 
3. ADVANTAGE AND DISADVANTAGE


Even if more than one factor gives you advantage or
disadvantage on a roll, you have it only once, and if 
you have advantag e and disadvantag e on the same 
roll, they cancel each other. 
4. REACTION TIMING 
Certain game features let you take a special action, 
called a reaction, in response to an event. Making 
opportunity attacks and casting the shield spell are 
two typical uses of reactions. If you're unsure when 
a reaction occurs in relation to its trigger, here's 
the rule: the reaction happens after its trigger, un­
less the description of the reaction explicitly says 
otherwise. Once you take a reaction. you can't take 
another one until the start of your next turn.

5. PROFICIENCY BONUS 
If your proficiency bonus applies to a roll, you can 
add the bonus only once to the roll, even if multiple 
things in the game say your bonus applies. More­
over, if more than one thing tells you to double or 
halve your bonus, you double it only once or halve 
it only once before applying it. Whether multiplied, 
divided, or left at its normal value, the bonus can be 
used only once per roll. 6. BONUS ACTION SPELLS


If you want to cast a spell that has a casting time of
1 bonus action, remember that you can't cast any 
other spells before or after it on the same turn, ex­
cept for cantrips with a casting time of 1 action. 
7. CONCENTRATION 
As soon as you start casting a spell or using a spe­
cial ability that requires concentration, your concen­
tration on another effect ends instantly. 
8. TEMPORARY HIT POINTS 
Temporary hit points aren't cumulative. If you have 
temporary hit points and receive more of them, you 
don't add them together, unless a game feature says 
you can. Instead, you decide which temporary hit 
points to keep. 
9. ROUND DOWN


Whenever you divide or multiply a number in the
game, round down if you end up with a fraction, 
even if the fraction is one-half or greater. 
IQ; HAVE FUN 
You don't need to know every rule to enjoy D&D, 
and each group has its own style-diff erent ways it 
likes to tell stories and to use the rules. Embrace 
what your group enjoys most. In short, follow 
your bliss!

CHAPTER 1


CHARACTER OPTIONS
HEN YOU MAKE YOUR D&D CHARACTER, 
you have an array of options in the


Player's Handbook to create the sort of
adventurer you want. This chapter adds 
to those options, making it possible to realize even 
more character concepts. If you combine these op­
tions with those in Xanathar's Guide to Everything, 
the possibilities for your characters become vast. 
Here are the options featured in this chapter: 
• A way to customize your character's origin by 
changing some of your racial traits 
• Guidance on changing your subclass 
• The artificer class, a master of magical invention 
• Class features and subclasses for every class in 
the Player's Handbook 
• Feats for anyone who uses that optional rule


CUS TOM IZING YOUR OR IGIN
At 1st level, you choose various aspects of your 
character , including ability scores, race, class, and 
background. Together these elements help paint a 
picture of your character's origin and give you the 
ability to create many different types of characters. 
Despite that versatility, a typical character race in 
D&D includes little or no choice-a lack that can 
make it difficult to realize certain character con­
cepts. The following subsections address that lack 
by adding choice to your character's race, allowing 
you to customize your ability scores, languages, 
and certain proficiencies to fit the origin you have 
in mind for your character. Character race in the 
game represents your character's fantasy species, 
combined with certain cultural assumptions. The 
following options step outside those assumptions to 
pave the way for truly unique characters.


ABILITY SCORE INCREASES
Whatever D&D race you choose for your character, 
you get a trait called Ability Score Increase. This 
increase reflects an archetypal bit of excellence in 
the adventurers of this kind in D&D's past. For ex­
ample, if you're a dwarf, your Constitution increases 
by 2, because dwarf heroes in D&D are often excep­
tionally tough. This increase doesn't apply to every 
dwarf, just to dwarf adventurers, and it exists to 
reinforce an archetype. That reinforcement is appro­
priate if you want to lean into the archetype, but it's 
unhelpful if your character doesn't conform to the 
archetype. If you'd like your character to follow their own 
path, you may ignore your Ability Score Increase 
trait and assign ability score increases tailored to 
your character. Here's how to do it: take any ability 
score increase you gain in your race or subrace 
and apply it to an ability score of your choice. If you 
gain more than one increase, you can't apply those 
increases to the same ability score, and you can't 
increase a score above 20. 
For example, if the Ability Score Increase trait of 
your race or subrace increases your Constitution by 
2 and your Wisdom by 1, you could instead increase 
your Intelligence by 2 and your Charisma by 1.


LANGUAGES
Your character's race includes languages that your 
character is assumed to know, usually Common 
and the language of your ancestors. For example, a 
halfling adventurer is assumed to know Common 
and Halfling. Here's the thing: D&D adventurers are 
extraordinar y, and your character might have grown 
up speaking languages different from the ones in 
your Languages trait. 
To customize the languages you know, you may 
replace each language in your Languag es trait with 
a language from the following list: Abyssal, Celes­
tial, Common, Deep Speech, Draconic, Dwarvish, 
Elvish, Giant, Gnomish, Goblin, Halfling, Infernal, 
Ore, Primordial, Sylvan, or Undercommon.


Your DM may add or remove languages from that
list, depending on what languages are appropriate 
for your campaign.


PROFICIENCIES
Some races and subraces grant proficiencies. These 
proficiencies are usually cultural, and your charac­
ter might not have any connection with the culture 
in question or might have pursued different training.


You can replace each of those proficiencies with a
different one of your choice, following the restric­
tions on the Proficiency Swaps table.

CHAP TER 1 I CHARA CTER OPTIONS


CUSTOM LIN EAC E
Instead of choosing one of the game's races for your 
character at 1st level, you can use the following traits 
to represent your character's lineage, giving you full 
control over how your character's origin shaped them: 
Creature Type. You· are a humanoid. You determine 
your appearance and whether you resemble any 
of your kin. 
Size. You are Small or Medium (your choice). 
Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet. 
Ability Score Increase. One ability score of your choice 
increases by 2. 
Feat. You gain one feat of your choice for which 
you qualify. 
Variable Trait. You gain one of the following options of 
your choice: (a) darkvision with a range of 60 feet or 
(b) proficiency in one skill of your choice. 
Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common 
and one other language that you and your DM agree 
is appropriate for your character. 
For example, high elf adventurers have proficiency 
with longswords, which are martial weapons. Con­
sulting the Proficiency Swaps table, we see that 
your high elf can swap that proficiency for profi­
ciency with another weapon or a tool. Your elf might 
be a musician, who chooses proficiency with a 
musical instrumen t-a type of tool-instead of with 
longswords. Similarly, elves start with proficiency 
in the Perception skill. Your elf might not have the 
keen senses associated with your kin and could take 
proficiency in a different skill, such as Performance. 
The "Equipment" chapter of the Player's Hand­
book includes weapons and tools suitable for these 
swaps, and your DM might allow additional options.


PERS ONALITY
The description of a race might suggest various 
things about the behavior and personality of that 
people's archetypal adventurers. You may ignore 
those suggestions, whether they're about alignment, 
moods, interests, or any other personality trait. Your 
character's personality and behavior are entirely 
yours to determine.


CH ANGING A SKIL L
Sometimes you pick a skill proficiency that ends up 
not being very useful in the campaign or that no lon­
ger fits your character's story. In those cases, talk to 
your DM about replacing that skill proficiency with 
another skill proficienc y offered by your class at 1st 
level. A convenient time for such a change is when 
you reach a level that grants you the Ability Score 
Increase feature, representing that your character 
has spent a level or two studying the new skill and 
letting the old one atrophy. 
8 CHAP TER I I CHARA CTER OPTIONSCH ANGING YOUR SUB CLASS 
Each character class involves the choice of a sub­
class at 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level. A subclass represents 
an area of specialization and offers different class 
features as you level up. With your DM's approva l, 
you can change your subclass when you would nor­
mally gain a new subclass feature. If you decide to 
make this change, choose another subclass that be­
longs to your class and replace all your old subclass 
features with the features of the new subclass that 
are for your new level and lower.


TRAINING TIME
To change your subclass, your DM might require 
you to spend time devoted to the transition, as 
you study the ways of the new specialization. This 
transition requires a number of days equal to twice 
your new level in the class; a higher level represents 
more to learn.


The DM might also require an expenditure of
money to pay for training, magical reagents, or other 
goods needed for the transition. The cost is typically 
100 gp times your new level. This cost might be 
accompanied by a quest of some sort. For example, 
a sorcerer who wants to adopt a Draconic Bloodline 
could be required to receive blood, a blessing, or 
both from an ancient dragon.


If you return to a subclass that you previously
held, you forgo the gold cost, and the time required 
for the transition is halved.


SUDDEN CHANGE
Sometimes a character undergoes a dramatic 
transformation in their beliefs and abilities. When 
a character experiences a profound self-realization 
or faces an entity or a place of overwhelming power, 
beauty, or terror, the DM might allow an immediate 
subclass change. Here are a few examples: 
• An Oath of Devotion paladin failed to stop a de­
monic horde from ravaging her homeland. After 
spending a night in sorrowful prayer, she rises the 
next morning with the features of the Oath of Ven­
geance, ready to hunt down the horde. 
• A wizard lies down for a nap beneath an oak tree 
whose roots reach into the Feywild. In his dreams, 
he faces visions of multiple possible futures. When 
· he awakens, his subclass features have been re­
placed by those of the School of Divination. 
• A cleric of the War Domain has spent years in 
conflict with the enemies of her temple. But one 
day, she wanders into a sun-dappled glade, where 
her god once shed a tear of mercy over the world's 
suffering. Drinking from the glade's brook, the 
cleric is filled with such compassion for all people 
that she now bears the powers of the Life Domain, 
ready to heal rather than make war.

ARTIFICER 
Masters of invention, artificers use ingenuity and 
magic to unlock extraordinary capabilities in ob­
jects. They see magic as a complex system waiting 
to be decoded and then harnessed in their spells 
and inventions. You can find everything you need to 
play one of these inventors in the next few sections.


Artificers use a variety of tools to channel their
arcane power. To cast a spell, an artificer might use 
alchemist's supplies to create a potent elixir, callig­
rapher's supplies to inscribe a sigil of power, or tin­
ker's tools to craft a temporary charm. The magic of 
artificers is tied to their tools and their talents, and 
few other characters can produce the right tool for a 
job as well as an artificer.


ARTIFICERS IN MANY WORLDS
Throughout the D&D multiverse, artificers create 
inventions and magic items of peace and war. Many 
lives have been brightened or saved because of the 
work of kind artificers, but countless lives have 
also been lost because of the mass destruction un­
leashed by certain artificers' creations. In the Forgotten Realms, the island of Lantan is 
home to many artificers, and in the world of Dragon­
lance, tinker gnomes are often members of this 
class. The strange technologies in the Barrier Peaks 
of the world of Greyhawk have inspired some folk 
to walk the path of the artificer, and in Mystara, var­
ious nations employ artificers to keep airships and 
other wondrous devices operational.


Artificers in the City of Sigil share discoveries
from throughout the multiverse, and from there, 
the gnome artificer Vi runs a cosmos-s panning 
business that hires adventurers to fix problems that 
others deem unfixable. In Vi's home world, Eberron, 
magic is harnessed as a form of science and de­
ployed throughout society, largely as a result of the 
wondrous ingenuity of artificers.

in the Dungeon Master's Guide and your artificer 
has been exposed to the operation of such weapons, 
your artificer is proficient with them.

STARTING EQUIPMENT
You start with the following equipment, in addition 
to the equipment granted by your background: 
any two simple weapons of your choice 
• a light crossbow and 20 bolts 
• your choice of studded leather armor or scale mail 
• thieves' tools and a dungeoneer's pack 
If you forgo this starting equipment, as well as the 
items offered by your background, you start with 
5d4 x 10 gp to buy your equipment.


MUL TICLASSI NG AND THE ARTIFICER
If your group uses the optional rule on multiclassing in 
the Player's Handbook, here's what you need to know if 
you choose artificer as one of your classes. 
Ability Score Minimum. As a multiclass character, 
you must have at least an Intelligence score of 13 to 
take a level in this class, or to take a level in another 
· class if you are already an artificer.
Proficiencies Cained. If artificer isn't your initial 
class, here are the proficiencies you gain when you 
take your first level as an artificer: light armor, medium 
armor, shields, thieves' tools, tinker's tools. 
Spell Slots. Add half your levels (rounded up) in 
the artificer class to the appropriate levels from other 
classes to determine your available spell slots.


CLASS FEA TURES
As an artificer, you gain the following class features, 
which are summarized in the Artificer table.


MAGICAL TINKERING
1st-level artificer feature


You've learned how to invest a spark of magic into
mundane objects. To use this ability, you must have 
thieves' tools or artisan's tools in hand. You then 
touch a Tiny nonmagical object as an action and 
give it one of the following magical properties of 
your choice: 
• The object sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and 
dim light for an additional 5 feet. 
• Whenever tapped by a creature, the object emits a 
recorded message that can be heard up to 10 feet 
away. You utter the message when you be stow this 
property on the object, and the recording can be 
no more than 6 seconds long. 
• The object continuously emits your choice of an 
odor or a nonverbal sound (wind, waves, chirping, 
or the like). The chosen phenomenon is perceiv­
able up to 10 feet away. 
• A static visual effect appears on one of the object's 
surfaces. This effect can be a picture, up to 25 
words of text, lines and shapes, or a mixture of 
these elements, as you like. 
The chosen property lasts indefinitely. As an 
action, you can touch the object and end the prop­
erty early. 
You can bestow magic on multiple objects, 
touching one object each time you use this feature, 
though a single object can only bear one property 
at a time. The maximum number of objects you 
can affect with this feature at one time is equal to 
your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one ob­
ject). If you try to exceed your maximum, the oldest 
property immediately ends, and then the new prop­
erty applies.


SPELLC ASTING
1st-level artificer feature


You've studied the workings of magic and how to
cast spells, channeling the magic through objects. 
To observers, you don't appear to be casting spells 
in a conventional way; you appear to produce 
wonders from mundane items and outlandish 
inventions. ·


TOOLS REQUIRED
You produce your artificer spell effects through your 
tools. You must have a spellcasting focus-specifi­
cally thieves' tools or some kind of artisan's tool-in 
hand when you cast any spell with this Spellcasting 
feature (meaning the spell has an "M" component THE MACI C OF ART IFICE 
As an artificer, you use tools when you cast your 
spells. When describing your spellcasting, think about 
how you're using a tool. For example, if you cast cure 
wounds using alchemist's supplies, you could be 
quickly producing a salve. If you cast it using tin ker's 
tools, you might have a miniature mechanical spider 
that binds wounds. The effect of the spell is the same 
either way.


Such details don't limit you in any way or provide you
with any benefit beyond the spell's effects. You don't 
have to justify how you're using tools to cast a spell.


But describing your spellcasting creatively is a fun way
to distinguish yourself from other spellcasters. 
when you cast it). You must be proficient with the 
tool to use it in this way. See the equipment chap­
ter in the Player's Handbook for descriptions of 
these tools. 
After you gain the Infuse Item feature at 2nd level, 
you can also use any item bearing one of your infu­
sions as a spellcasting focus. 
CANTRIPS (0-LEVEL SPELLS) 
You know two cantrips of your choice from the arti­
ficer spell list. At higher levels, you learn additional 
artificer cantrips of your choice, as shown in the 
Cantrips Known column of the Artificer table. 
When you gain a level in this class, you can re­
place one of the artificer can trips you know with 
another cantrip from the artificer spell list.


PREPARING AND CASTING SPELLS
The Artificer table shows how many spell slots you 
have to cast your artificer spells. To cast one of your 
artificer spells of 1st level or higher, you must ex­
pend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain 
all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.


You prepare the list of artificer spells that are
available for you to cast, choosing from the artificer 
spell list. When you do so, choose a number of arti­
ficer spells equal to your Intelligence modifier + half 
your artificer level, rounded down (minimum of one 
spell). The spells must be of a level for which you 
have spell slots. 
For example, if you are a 5th-level artificer, you 
have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. 
With an Intelligence of 14, your list of prepared 
spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in 
any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell 
cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 
2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it 
from your list of prepared spells.


You can change your list of prepared spells when
you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of artifi­
cer spells requires time spent tinkering with your 
spellcasting focuses: at least 1 minute per spell level 
for each spell on your list.


CHA PTER I I CHAR ACTER OPTIONS
SPELLCASTING ABILIT Y 
Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your arti­
ficer spells; your understanding of the theory behind 
magic allows you to wield these spells with superior 
skill. You use your Intelligence whenever an artificer 
spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, 
you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the 
saving throw DC for an artificer spell you cast and 
when making an attack roll with one. 
Spell save DC= 8 +your proficiency bonus+ your


Intelligence modifier
Spell attack modifier= your proficiency bonus+ your


Intelligence modifier
RITUAL CASTING


You can cast an artificer spell as a ritual if that spell
has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.


ARTIFICER SPELL LIST
Here's the list of spells you consult when you learn 
an artificer spell. The list is organized by spell level, 
not charader level. If a spell can be cast as a ritual, 
the ritual tag appears after the spell's name. 
Each spell is in the Player's Handbook, unless it 
has one asterisk (a spell in chapter 3) or two aster­
isks (a spell in Xanathar's Guide to Everything).

jects into magic items.


INFUSIONS KNOWN
When you gain this feature, pick four artificer in­
fusions to learn, choosing from the "Artificer Infu­
sions" section at the end of the class's description.


You learn additional infusions of your choice when
you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in 
the Infusions Known column of the Artificer table. 
Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can re­
place one of the artificer infusions you learned with 
a new one.


INFUSING AN ITEM
Whenever you finish a long rest, you can touch a 
nonmagical object and imbue it with one of your 
artificer infusions, turning it into a magic item. An 
infusion works on only certain kinds of objects, as 
specified in the infusion's description. If the item re­
quires attunement, you can attune yourself to it the 
instant you infuse the item. If you decide to attune to 
the item later, you must do so using the normal pro­
cess for attunement (see the attunement rules in the 
Dungeon Master's Guide). 
Your infusion remains in an item indefinitely, but 
when you die, the infusion vanishes after a number 
of days equal to your Intell igence modifier (mini­
mum of 1 day). The infusion also vanishes if you 
replace your knowledge of the infusion. 
You can infuse. more than one nonmagical object 
at the end of a long rest; the maximum number of 
objects appears in the Infused Items column of the 
Artificer table. You must touch each of the objects, 
and each of your infusions can be in only one object 
at a time. Moreover, no object can bear more than 
one of your infusions at a time. If you try to exceed 
your maximum number of infusions, the oldest infu­
sion ends, and then the new infusion applies.


If an infusion ends on an item that contains other
things, like a bag of holding, its contents harmlessly 
appear in and around its space.


ARTIFICER SPECIALIST
3rd-level artificer feature 
Choose the type of specialist you are: Alchemist, 
Armorer , Artillerist, or Battle Smith, each of which 
is detailed after the class's description. Your choice 
grants you features at 5th level and again at 9th and 
15th level.


THE RIGHT TOOL FOR THE OB
3rd-level artificer feature


You've learned how to produce exactly the tool you
need: with thieves' tools or artisan's tools in hand, 
you can magically create one set of artisan's tools in 
an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you. This cre­
ation requires 1 hour of uninterrupted work, which 
can coincide with a short or long rest. Though the 
product of magic, the tools are nonmagical, and they 
vanish when you use this feature again.


ABILITY SCORE IMP ROVEMENT
4th-level artificer feature 
When you reach 4th level and again at 8th, 12th, 
16th, and 19th level, you can increase one abil­
ity score of your choice by 2, or you can increase 
two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, 
you can't increase an ability score above 20 using 
this feature.


TOO L EXPERTISE
6th-level artificer feature


Your proficiency bonus is now doubled for any
ability check you make that uses your proficiency 
with a tool. FLASH OF GENIUS 
7th-level artificer feature


You've gained the ability to come up with solutions
under pressure. When you or another creature you 
can see within 30 feet of you makes an ability check 
or a saving throw, you can use your reaction to add 
your Intelligence modifier to the roll.


You can use this feature a number of times equal
to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once).


You regain all expended uses when you finish a
long rest.


MAGIC ITEM ADEPT
10th-level artificer feature


You've achieved a profound understanding of how to
use and make magic items: 
• You can attune to up to four magic items at once. 
• If you craft a magic item with a rarity of com­
mon or uncommon, it takes you a quarter of the 
normal time, and it costs you half as much of the 
usual gold.


SPELL -STORING ITEM
11th-level artificer feature 
You can now store a spell in an object. Whene ver 
you finish a long rest, you can touch one simple or 
martial weapon or one item that you can use as a 
spellcasting focus, and you store a spell in it, choos­
ing a 1st-or 2nd-level spell from the artificer spell 
list that requires 1 action to cast (you needn't have it 
prepared).


DWARF ALCHEMIST WITH
liOMUNCULUS SERVANT 
CHAP TER 1 J CHA RACTER OPTIONS
While holding the object, a creature can take an 
action to produce the spell's effect from it, using 
your spellcasting ability modifier. If the spell re­
quires concentration, the creature must concentrate.


The spell stays in the object until it's been used a
number of times equal to twice your Intelligence 
modifier (minimum of twice) or until you use this 
feature again to store a spell in an object.


MAGIC ITEM SAVA NT
14th-level artificer feature 
Your skill with magic items deepens: 
• You can attune to up to five magic items at once. 
• You ignore all class, race, spell, and level require­
ments on attuning to or using a magic item.


MAGIC ITEM MASTER
18th-level artificer feature 
You can now attune to up to six magic items at once.


SOUL OF ARTIF ICE
20th-level artificer feature


You have developed a mystical connection to your
magic items, which you can draw on for protection: 
• You gain a +1 bonus to all saving throws per 
magic item you are currently attuned to. 
• If you're reduced to 0 hit points but not killed out­
right, you can use your reaction to end one of your 
artificer infusions, causing you to drop to 1 hit 
point instead of 0.


ARTIFIC ER SPE CIALIS TS
Artificers pursue many disciplines. Here are spe­
cialist options you can choose from at 3rd level.

An Alchemist is an expert at combining reagents
to produce mystical effects. Alchemists use their 
creations to give life and to leech it away. Alchemy 
is the oldest of artificer traditions, and its versatility 
has long been valued during times of war and peace.


TOOL PROFICIENCY
3rd-level Alchemist feature 
You gain proficiency with alchemist's supplies. If 
you already have this proficiency, you gain pro­
ficiency with one other type of artisan's tools of 
your choice. 
14 CHAP TER 1 J CHA RACTER OPTIONSALCHEMIS T SPELLS 
3rd-level Alchemist feature


You always have certain spells prepared after you
reach particular levels in this class, as shown in the 
Alchemist Spells table. These spells count as arti­
ficer spells for you, but they don't count against the 
number of artificer spells you prepare.


ALCHEMIST SPELLS

3rd healing word, ray of sickness 
5th flaming sphere, Me/f's acid arrow 
9th gaseous form, mass healing word

17th cloudkill, raise dead


EXPERIM ENTAL ELIXIR
3rd-level Alchemist feature 
Whenever you finish a long rest, you can magi­
cally produce an experimental elixir in an empty 
flask you touch. Roll on the Experimental Elixir 
table for the elixir's effect, which is triggered when 
someone drinks the elixir. As an action, a creature 
can drink the elixir or administer it to an incapaci­
tated creature.


You can create additional experimental elixirs
by expending a spell slot of 1st level or higher for 
each one. When you do so, you use your action to 
create the elixir in an empty flask you touch, and 
you choose the elixir's effect from the Experimental 
Elixir table.


Creating an experim ental elixir requires you to
have alchemist supplies on your person, and any 
elixir you create with this feature lasts until it is 
drunk or until the end of your next long rest. 
When you reach certain levels in this class, you 
can make more elixirs at the end of a long rest: two 
at 6th level and three at 15th level. Roll for each 
elixir's effect separately. Each elixir requires its 
own flask.


EXPERIMENTAL ELIXIR

Healing. The drinker regains a number of hit points 
equal to 2d4 +your Intelligence modifier . 
2 Swiftness. The drinker's walking spe ed increases by 
10 feet for 1 hour. 
3 Resilience. The drinker gains a +1 bonus to AC for 
10 minutes. 
4 Boldness. The drinker can roll a d4 and add the 
number rolled to every attack roll and saving throw 
they make for the next minute. 
d6 Effect 
5 Flight. The drinker gains a flying speed of 10 feet for 
10 minutes. 
6 Transformation. The drinker's body is transformed 
as if by the alter self spell. The drinker determines 
the transformation caused by the spell, the effects 
of which last for 10 minutes.


ALCHEMICAL SAVANT
5th-level Alchemist feature


You've developed masterful command of magical
chemicals, enhancing the healing and damage you 
create through them. Whenever you cast a spell 
using your alchemist's supplies as the spellcasting 
focus, you gain a bonus to one roll of the spell. That 
roll must restore hit points or be a damage roll that 
deals acid, fire, necrotic, or poison damage, and 
the bonus equals your Intelligence modifier (mini­
mum of+l).


RESTORA TIVE REAGENTS
9th-level Alchemist feature


You can incorporate restorative reagents into some
of your works: 
• Whenever a creature drinks an experim ental 
elixir you created, the creature gains temporary 
hit points equal to 2d6 +your Intelligence modifier 
(minimum of 1 temporary hit point). 
• You can cast lesser restoration without expend­
ing a spell slot and without preparing the spell, 
provided you use alchemist's supplies as the spell­
casting focus. You can do so a number of times 
equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 
once), and you regain all expended uses when you 
finish a long rest.


CHEMIC AL MASTER Y
15th-level Alchemist feature


You have been exposed to so many chemicals that
they pose little risk to you, and you can use them to 
quickly end certain ailments: 
• You gain resistance to acid damage and poison 
damage, and you are immune to the poisoned 
condition.

TASllA'
An artificer who specializes as an Armorer modifies 
armor to function almost like a second skin. The 
armor is enhanced to hone the artificer's magic, 
unleash potent attacks, and generate a formidable 
defense. The artificer bonds with this armor, becom­
ing one with it even as they experiment with it and 
refine its magical capabilities.


TOOLS OF THE TRADE
3rd-level Armorer feature 
You gain proficiency with heavy armor. You also 
gain proficiency with smith's tools. If you already 
have this tool proficiency, you gain proficiency with 
one other type of artisan's tools of your choice.


ARMORER SPELLS
3rd-level Armorer feature


You always have certain spells prepared after you
reach particular levels in this class, as shown in the 
Armorer Spells table. These spells count as artificer 
spells for you, but they don't count against the num­
ber of artificer spells you prepare.

ARCANE ARMOR
3rd-level Armorer feature 
Your metallurgical pursuits have led to you mak­
ing armor a conduit for your magic. As an action, 
you can turn a suit of armor you are wearing 
into Arcane Armor, provided you have smith's 
tools in hand.


You gain the following benefits while wearing
this armor: 
• If the armor normally has a Strength requirement, 
the arcane armor lacks this requirement for you. 
• You can use the arcane armor as a spellcasting 
focus for your artificer spells. 
• The armor attaches to you and can't be removed 
against your will. It also expands to cover your 
entire body, although you can retract or deploy the 
helmet as a bonus action. The armor replaces any 
CHAPTER 1 I CHARA CTER OPTIONS 
missing limbs, functioning identically to a limb 
it replaces. 
• You can doff or don the armor as an action.


The armor continues to be Arcane Armor until
you don another suit of armor or you die.


ARMOR MODEL
3rd-level Armorer feature 
You can customize your Arcane Armor. When you 
do so, choose one of the following armor models: 
Guardian or Infiltrator. The model you choose gives 
you special benefits while you wear it. 
Each model includes a special weapon. When you 
attack with that weapon, you can add your Intelli­
gence modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity, to 
the attack and damage rolls.


You can change the armor's model whenever you
finish a short or long rest, provided you have smith's 
tools in hand. 
Guardi an. You design your armor to be in the 
front line of conflict. It has the following features: 
Thunder Gauntlets. Each of the armor's gauntlets 
counts as a simpl_e melee weapon while you aren't 
holding anything in it, and it deals ld8 thunder 
damage on a hit. A creature hit by the gauntlet has 
disadvantage on attack rolls against targets other 
than you until the start of your next turn, as the ar­
mor magically emits a distracting pulse when the 
creature attacks someone else. 
16 CHAPTER 1 / CHA RACTER OPTIONS Defensive Field. As a bonus action, you can gain 
temporary hit points equal to your level in this 
class, replacing any temporary hit points you al­
ready have. You lose these temporary hit points if 
you doff the armor. You can use this bonus action 
a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, 
and you regain all expended uses when you finish 
a long rest. 
Infiltra tor. You customize your armor for subtle 
undertakings. It has the following features: 
Lightning Launcher. A gemlike node appears on 
one of your armored fists or on the chest (your 
choice). It counts as a simple ranged weapon, with 
a normal range of 90 feet and a long range of 300 
feet, and it deals ld6 lightning damage on a hit. 
Once on each of your turns when you hit a crea­
ture with it, you can deal an extra ld6 lightning 
damage to that target. 
Powe red Steps. Your walking speed increases 
. by 5 feet. 
Dampening Field. You have advantage on Dexterity 
(Stealth) checks. If the armor normally imposes 
disadvantage on such checks, the advantage and 
disadvantage cancel each other, as normal.


EXTRA ATTACK
5th-level Armorer feature 
You can attack twice, rather than once, whenever 
you take the Attack action on your turn. •


ARMOR MODIFICATIONS
9th-level Armorer feature 
You learn how to use your artificer infusions to spe­
cially modify your Arcane Armor. That armor now 
counts as separate items for the purposes of your 
Infuse Items feature: armor (the chest piece), boots, 
helmet, and the armor's special weapon. Each of 
those items can bear one of your infusions, and the 
infusions tran sfer over if you change your armor's 
model with the Armor Model feature. In addition, 
the maximum number of items you can infuse at 
once increases by 2, but those extra items must be 
part of your Arcane Armor.


PERFECTED ARMOR
15th-level Armorer feature


Your Arcane Armor gains additional benefits based
on its model, as shown belo w. 
Gua rdian. When a Huge or smaller creature you 
can see ends its turn within 30 feet of you, you can 
use your reaction to magically force the creature to 
make a Strength saving throw against your spell 
save DC, pulling the creature up to 30 feet toward 
you to an unoccupied space. If you pull the target to 
a space within 5 feet of you, you can make a melee 
weapon attack against it as part of this reaction.


You can use this reaction a number of times equal
to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all ex­
pended uses of it when you finish a long rest. 
Infiltra tor. Any creature that takes lightning dam­
age from your Lightning Launcher glimmers with 
magical light until the start of your next turn. The 
glimmering creature sheds dim light in a 5-foot ra­
dius, and it has disadvantage on attack rolls against 
you, as the light jolts it if it attacks you. In addition, 
the next attack roll against it has advantage, and if 
that attack hits, the target takes an extra ld6 light­
ning damage.

An Artillerist specializes in using magic to hurl
energy, projectiles, and explosions on a battlefield.


This destructive power is valued by armies in the
wars on many different worlds. And when war 
passes, some members of this specialization seek to 
build a more peaceful world by using their powers 
to fight the resurgence of strife. The world-hopping 
gnome artificer Vi has been especiall y vocal about 
making things right: "It's about time we fixed things 
instead of blowing them all to hell." TOOL PROFICIENCY

ELDRITCH CANNON
3rd-level Artillerist feature 
You've learned how to create a magical cannon. 
Using woodcarv er's tools or smith's tools, you can 
take an action to magicall y create a Small or Tiny 
eldritch cannon in an unoccupied space on a hori­
zontal surface within 5 feet of you. A Small eldritch 
cannon occupies its space, and a Tiny one can be 
held in one hand. 
Once you create a cannon, you can't do so again 
until you finish a long rest or until you expend a 
spell slot to create one. You can have only one can­
non at a time and can't create one while your can­
non is present. 
The cannon is a magical object. Regardless of 
size, the cannon has an AC of 18 and a number of 
hit points equal to five times your artificer level. It is 
immune to poison damage and psychic damage. If it 
is forced to make an ability check or a saving throw, 
treat all its ability scores as 10 (+O). If the mending 
spell is cast on it, it regains 2d6 hit points. It disap­
pears if it is reduced to 0 hit points or after 1 hour. 
You can dismiss it early as an action. 
When you create the cannon, you determine its 
appearance and whether it has legs. You also de­
cide which type it is, choosing from the options on 
the Eldritch Cannons table. On each of your turns, 
you can take a bonus action to cause the cannon to 
activate if you are within 60 feet of it. As part of the 
same bonus action, you can direct the cannon to 
walk or climb up to 15 feet to an unoccupied space, 
provided it has legs.

Flamethrower The cannon exhales fire in an adjacent 
15-foot cone that you designa te. Each 
creature in that area must make a Dexter­

DC, taking 2d8 fire damage on a failed 
save or half as much damage on a suc­
cessful one. The fire ignites any flamma­
ble objects in the area that aren't being 
worn or carried. 
Force Ballista Make a ranged spell attack, originating 
from the cannon, at one creature or 
object within 120 feet of it. On a hit, the 
target takes 2d8 force damage, and if the 
target is a creature, it is pushed up to 5 
Protector . feet away from the cannon. 
The· cannon emits a burst of positive en­

5th-level Artillerist feature 
You know how to turn a wand, staff , or rod into an 
arcane firearm, a conduit for your destructive spells. 
When you finish a long rest, you can use woodcarv­
er's tools to carve special sigils into a wand, staff, 
or rod and thereby turn it into your arcane firearm.


The sigils disappear from the object if you later
carve them on a different item. The sigils otherwise 
last indefinitely.


You can use your arcane firearm as a spellcasting
focus for your artificer spells. When you cast an ar­
tificer spell through the firearm, roll a d8, and you 
gain a bonus to one of the spell's damage rolls equal 
to the number rolled.


EXPLOSIV E CANNO N
9th-level Artillerist feature


Every eldritch cannon you create is now more
destructive: 
• The cannon's damage rolls all increase by ld8. 
• As an action, you can command the cannon to 
detonate if you are within 60 feet of it. Doing so 
destroys the cannon and forces each creature 
within 20 feet of it to make a Dexterity saving 
throw against your spell save DC, taking 3d8 force 
damage on a failed save or half as much damage 
on a successful one.


FORTIFIED POSITION
15th-level Artillerist feature 
You're a master at forming well-defended emplace­
ments using your Eldritch Cannon: 
• You and your allies have half cover while within 
10 feet of a cannon you create with Eldritch Can­
non, as a result of a shimmering field of magical 
protection that the cannon emits. 
• You can now have two cannons at the same time. 
You can create two with the same action (but not 
the same spell slot), and you can activate both of 
them with the same bonus action. You determine 
whether the cannons are identical to each other 
or different. You can't create a third cannon while 
you have two.

TASHA
Armies require protection, and someone has to put 
things back together if defenses fail. A combination 
of protector and medic, a Battle Smith is an expert 
at defending others and repairing both materiel and 
personnel. To aid in their work, Battle Smiths are 
accompanied by a steel defender, a protective com­
panion of their own creation. Many soldiers tell sto­
ries of nearly dying before being saved by a Battle 
Smith and a steel defender. 
In t.he world of Eberron, Battle Smiths played 
a key role in House Cannith's work on battle con­
structs and the original warforged, and after the 
Last War, these artificers led efforts to aid those 
who were injured in the war's horrific battles.

3rd-level Battle Smith feature


Your combat training and your experiments with
magic have paid off in two ways: 
• You gain proficiency with martial weapons. 
• When you attack with a magic weapon, you 
can use your Intelligence modifier, instead of 
Strength or Dexterity modifier, for the attack and 
damage rolls.


STEEL DEFENDER
3rd-level Battle Smith feature 
Your tinkering has borne you a companion, a steel 
defender. It's friendly to you and your companions, 
and it obeys your commands. See its game statis­
tics in the Steel Defender stat block, which uses 
your proficiency bonus (PB) in several places. You 
determine the creature's appearance and whether it has two legs or four; your choice has no effect on its 
game statistics. 
In combat, the defender shares your initiative 
count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. 
It can move and use its reaction on its own, but the 
only action it takes on its turn is the Dodge action, 
unless you take a bonus action on your turn to com­
mand it to take another action. That action can be 
one in its stat block or some other action. If you are 
incapacitated, the defender can take any action of its 
choice, not just Dodge. 
If the mending spell is cast on the defender , it 
regains 2d6 hit points. If it has died within the last 
hour, you can use your smith's tools as an action 
to revive it, provided you are within 5 feet of it and 
you expend a spell slot of 1st level or higher. The 
defender returns to life after 1 minute with all its hit 
points restored. 
At the end of a long rest, you can create a new 
steel defender if you have smith's tools with you. If 
you already have a defender from this feature, the 
first one immediately perishes. The defender also 
perishes if you die.

At 3rd level, a barbarian gains the Primal Path 
feature, which offers you the choice of a subclass.


The following options are available to you when
making that choice: Path of the Beast and Path of 
Wild Magic.

TASHA
Barbarians who walk the Path of the Beast draw 
their rage from a bestial spark burning within their 
souls. That beast bursts forth in the throes of rage, 
physically transforming the barbarian.


Such a barbarian might be inhabited by a primal
spirit or be descended from shape-shifters. You can 
choose the origin of your feral might or determine it 
by rolling on the Origin of the Beast table.


ORIGIN OF THE BEAST
d4 Origin

4 One of your parents is a lycanthrope, and you've 
inherited some of their curse. 
You are descended from an archdruid and inher­
ited the ability to partially change shape. 
A fey spirit gifted you with the ability to adopt dif­
ferent bestial aspects. 
An ancient animal spirit dwells within you, allow­
ing you to walk this path.


FORM OF THE BEAST
3rd-level Path of the Beast feature 
When you enter your rage, you can transform, re­
vealing the bestial power within you. Until the rage 
ends, you manifest a natural weapon. It counts as 
a simple melee weapon for you, and you add your


Strength modifier to the attack and damage rolls
when you attack with it, as normal. 
You choose the weapon's form each time you rage: 
Bite. Your mouth transforms into a bestial muzzle 
or great mandibles (your choice ). It deals ld8 
· piercing damage on a hit. Once on each of your 
turns when you damage a creature with this bite, 
you regain a number of hit points equal to your 
proficiency bonus, provided you have less than 
half your hit points when you hit. 
Claws. Each of your hands transforms into a claw, 
which you can use as a weapon if it's empty. It 
deals ld6 slashing damage on a hit. Once on each 
of your turns when you attack with a claw using 
the Attack action, you can make one additional 
claw attack as part of the same action. 
Tail. You grow a lashing, spiny tail, which deals ld8 
piercing damage on a hit and has the reach prop­
erty. If a creature you can see within 10 feet of 
you hits you with an attack roll, you can use your 
reaction to swipe your tail and roll a d8, applying 
a bonus to your AC equal to the number rolled, po­
tentially causing the attack to miss you.


BESTIAL SOUL
6th-level Path of the Beast feature 
The feral power within you increases, causing the 
natural weapons of your Form of the Beast to count 
as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance 
and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.


You can also alter your form to help you adapt to
your surroundings. When you finish a short or long 
rest, choose one of the following benefits, which 
lasts until you finish your next short or long rest: 
• You gain a swimming speed equal to your walking 
speed, and you can breathe und erwater. 
• You gain a climbing speed equal to your walking 
speed, and you can climb difficult surfaces, includ­
ing upside down on ceilings, without needing to 
make an ability check. 
• When you jump, you can make a Strength (Athlet­
ics) check and extend your jump by a number of 
feet equal to the check's total. You can make this 
special check only once per turn.


INFECTIOUS FURY
10th-level Path of the Beast feature


When you hit a creature with your natural weapons
while you are raging, the beast within you can curse 
your target with rabid fury. The target must succeed 
on a Wisdom saving throw (DC equal to 8 +your 
Constitution modifier + your proficienc y bonus) or 
suffer one of the following effects (your choice): 
• The target must use its reaction to make a melee 
attack against another creature of your choice that 
you can see. 
• The target takes 2d12 psychic damage.


You can use this feature a number of times equal
to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all ex­
pended uses when you finish a long rest.


CALL THE HUNT
14th-level Path of the Beast feature


The beast within you grows so powerful that you
can spread its ferocity to others and gain resilience 
from them joining your hunt. When you enter your 
rage, you can choose a number of other willing crea­
tures you can see within 30 feet of you equal to your 
Constitution modifier (minimum of one creature). You gain 5 temporary hit points for each creature 
that accepts this feature. Until the rage ends, the 
chosen creatures can each use the following benefit 
once on each of their turns: when the creature hits a 
target with an attack roll and deals damage to it, the 
creature can roll a d6 and gain a bonus to the dam­
age equal to the number rolled.


You can use this feature a number of times equal
to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all ex­
pended uses when you finish a long rest.

TASHA
Many places in the multiverse abound with beauty, 
intense emotion, and rampant magic; the Feywild, 
the Upper Planes, and other realms of supernatural 
power radiate with such forces and can profoundly 
influence people. As folk of deep feeling, barbarians 
are especially susceptible to these wild influences, 
with some barbarians being transformed by the 
magic. These magic-suffused barbarians walk the 
Path of Wild Magic. Elf, tiefling, aasimar, and genasi 
barbarians often seek this path, eager to manifest 
the otherworldly magic of their ancestors.


MAGIC AWARENESS
3rd-level Path of Wild Magic feature 
As an action, you can open your awareness to the 
presence of concentrated magic. Until the end of 
your next turn, you know the location of any spell 
or magic item within 60 feet of you that isn't behind 
total cover. When you sense a spell, you learn which 
school of magic it belongs to.


You can use this feature a number of times equal
to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all ex­
pended uses when you finish a long rest.


WILD SURGE
3rd-level Path of Wild Magic feature


The magical energy roiling inside you sometimes
erupts from you. When you enter your rage, roll on 
the Wild Magic table to determine the magical ef­
fect produced. 
If the effect requires a saving throw, the DC 
equals 8 +your proficiency bonus +your Constitu­
tion modifier.

If a creature has a Bardic Inspiration die from you
and casts a spell that restores hit points or deals 
damage, the creature can roll that die and choose a 
target affected by the spell. Add the number rolled 
as a bonus to the hit points regained or the damage 
dealt. The Bardic Inspiration die is then lost.


BARDI C VERSA TILIT Y
4th-level bard feature


Whenever you reach a level in this class that grants
the Ability Score Improvement feature, you can do 
one of the following, representing a change in focus 
as you use your skills and magic: 
• Replace one of the skills you chose for the Exper­
tise feature with one of your other skill proficien­
cies that isn't benefiting from Expertise. 
• Replace one cantrip you learned from this class's


Spellcasting feature with another cantrip from the
bard spell list.


BARD CO LLEG E S
At 3rd level, a bard gains the Bard College feature, 
which offers you the choice of a subclass. The fol­
lowing options are available to you when making 
that choice: College of Creation and College of 
Eloquence.


CO LLEGE OF CREATION
One bAr�'� �on� of creAtion i� the �core to Another· 
penon'� ni�htmAre�. 
TA�HA ' 
Bards believe the cosmos is a work of art-the cre­
ation of the first dragons and gods. That creative 
work included harmonies that continue to resound 
through existence today, a power known as the 
Song of Creation. The bards of the College of Cre­
ation draw on that primeval song through dance, 
music, and poetry, and their teachers share this 
lesson: "Before the sun and the moon, there was the 
Song, and its music awoke the first dawn. Its melo­
dies so delighted the stones and trees that some of 
them gained a voice of their own. And now they sing 
too. Learn the Song, students, and you too can teach 
the mountains to sing and dance."


Dwarves and gnomes often encourage their bards
to become students of the Song of Creation. And 
among dragonborn, the Song of Creation is revered, 
for legends portray Bahamut and Tiamat-the great­
est of dragons-as two of the song's first singers.


MOTE OF POTENTIAL
3rd-level College of Creation feature


Whenever you give a creature a Bardic Inspiration
die, you can utter a note from the Song of Creation 
to create a Tiny mote of potential, which orbits 
within 5 feet of that creature. The mote is intangi­
ble and invulnerable, and it lasts until the Bardic 
28 CHAP TER 1 I CHA RACTER OPTION S Inspiration die is lost. The mote looks like a musical 
note, a star, a flower, or another symbol of art or life 
that you choose.


When the creature uses the Bardic Inspiration
die, the mote provides an additional effect based on 
whether the die benefits an ability check, an attack 
roll, or a saving throw, as detailed below: 
Ability Check. When the creature rolls the Bardic 
Inspiration die to add it to an ability check, the 
creature can roll the Bardic Inspiration die again 
and choose which roll to use, as the mote pops 
and emits colorful, harmless sparks for a moment. 
Attack Roll. Immedia tely after the creature rolls 
the Bardic Inspiration die to add it to an attack roll 
against a target, the mote thunderously shatters.


The target and each creature of your choice that
you can see within 5 feet of it must succeed on a


Constitution saving throw against your spell save
DC or take thunder damage equal to the number 
rolled on the Bardic Inspiration die. 
Saving Throw. Immediately after the creature rolls 
the Bardic Inspiration die and adds it to a saving 
throw, the mote vanishes with the sound of soft 
music, causing the creature to gain temporary hit 
points equal to the number rolled on the Bardic 
Inspiration die plus your Charisma modifier (mini­
mum of 1 temporary hit point).


PERFORMANCE OF CREATION
3rd-level College of Creation feature 
As an action, you can channel the magic of the Song 
of Creation to create one nonmagical item of your 
choice in an unoccupied space within 10 feet of you.


The item must appear on a surface or in a liquid
that can support it. The gp value of the item can't 
be more than 20 times your bard level, and the item 
must be Medium or smaller. The item glimmers 
softly, and a creature can faintly hear music when 
touching it. The created item disappears after a 
number of hours equal to your proficiency bonus. 
For examples of items you can create, see the equip­
ment chapter of the Player's Handbook. 
Once you create an item with this feature, you 
can't do so again until you finish a long rest, unless 
you expend a spell slot of 2nd level or higher to use 
this feature again. You can have only one item cre­
ated by this feature at a time; if you use this action 
and already have an item from this feature, the first 
one immediately vanishes. 
The size of the item you can create with this fea­
ture increases by one size category when you reach 
6th level (Large) and 14th level (Huge).

the walking speed of that creature by 10 feet until the end of the 
turn, provided the item isn't incapacitated.


ACTIONS

ANIMATING PERFORMANCE
6th-level College of Creation feature 
As an action, you can target a Large or smaller non­
magical item you can see within 30 feet of you and 
animate it. The animate item uses the Dancing Item 
stat block, which uses your proficienc y bonus (PB).


The item is friendly to you and your companions and
obeys your commands. It lives for 1 hour, until it is 
reduced to 0 hit points, or until you die. 
In combat, the item shares your initiative count, 
but it takes its turn immedia tely after yours. It can 
move and use its reaction on its own, but the only 
action it takes on its turn is the Dodge action, unless 
you take a bonus action on your turn to command it 
to take another action. That action can be one in its 
stat block or some other action. If you are incapaci­
tated, the item can take any action of its choice, not 
just Dodge. 
When you use your Bardic Inspiration feature, you 
can command the item as part of the same bonus 
action you use for Bardic Inspiration. 
Once you animate an item with this feature, you 
can't do so again until you finish a long rest, unless 
you expend a spell slot of 3rd level or higher to use 
this feature again. You can have only one item ani­
mated by this feature at a time; if you use this action 
and already have a dancing item from this feature, 
the first one immediately becomes inanimate. DROW B/\RO

CREATIVE CRESCENDO
14th-level College of Creation feature 
When you use your Performance of Creation fea­
ture, you can create more than one item at once. 
The number of items equals your Charisma modi­
fier (minimum of two items). If you create an item 
that would exceed that number, you choose which 
of the previously created items disappears. Only one 
of these items can be of the maximum size you can 
create; the rest must be Small or Tiny. 
You are no longer limited by gp value when creat­
ing items with Performance of Creation.

You are a master at saying the right thing at the
right time. When you make a Charisma (Persua­

d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.


UNSETTLING WORDS
3rd-level College of Eloquence feature


You can spin words laced with magic that unsettle
a creature and cause it to doubt itself. As a bonus 
action, you can expend one use of your Bardic Inspi­
ration and choose one creature you can see within 
60 feet of you. Roll the Bardic Inspiration die. The 
creature must subtract the number rolled from the 
next saving throw it makes before the start of your 
next turn.


UNFAILING INSPIR ATION
6th-level College of Eloquence feature


Your inspiring words are so persuasive that others
feel driven to succeed. When a creature adds one 
of your Bardic Inspiration dice to its ability check, 
attack roll, or saving throw and the roll fails, the 
creature can keep the Bardic Inspiration die.


UNIVERSAL SPEECH
6th-level College of Eloquence feature


You gain the ability to make your speech intelligible
to any creature. As an action, choose one or more 
creatures within 60 feet of you, up to a number 
equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one 
creature). The chosen creatures can magically un­
derstand you, regardless of the language you speak, 
for 1 hour. 
Once you use this feature, you can't use it again 
until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a 
spell slot of any level to use it again.


INFECTIOUS INSPIRATION
14th-level College of Eloquence feature 
When you successfully inspire someone, the power 
of your eloquence can now spread to someone else. 
When a creature within 60 feet of you adds one of 
your Bardic Inspiration dice to its ability check, at­
tack roll, or saving throw and the roll succeeds, you 
can use your reaction to encourage a different crea­
ture (other than yourself) that can hear you within 
60 feet of you, giving it a Bardic Inspiration die with­
out expending any of your Bardic Inspiration uses. 
You can use this ·reaction a number of times equal 
to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), and 
you regain all expended uses when you finish a 
long rest.

The Order Domain represents discipline, as well as 
devotion to the laws that govern a society, an insti­

logic and justice as they serve their gods, examples 
of which appear in the Order Deities table. 
Clerics of Order believe that well-crafted laws es­
tablish legitimate hierarchies, and those selected by 
law to lead must be obeyed. Those who obey must 
do so to the best of their ability, and if those who 
lead fail to protect the law, they must be replaced. In 
this manner, law weaves a web of obligations that 
create order and security in a chaotic multiverse. A CLERIC HARNESSES

start of your next turn. The next time one of your 
allies hits the cursed creature with an attack, the 
target also takes 2d8 psychic damage, and the curse 
ends. You can curse a creature in this way only 
once per turn.

The balm of peace thrives at the heart of healthy
communities, between friendly nations, and in the 
souls of the kindhearted. The gods of peace inspire 
people of all sorts to resolve conflict and to stand up 
against those forces that try to prevent peace from 
flourishing. See the Peace Deities table for a list of 
some of the gods associated with this domain. 
Clerics of the Peace Domain preside over the sign­
ing of treaties, and they are often asked to arbitrate 
in disputes. These clerics' blessings draw people 
together and help them shoulder one another's 
burdens, and the clerics' magic aids those who are 
driven to fight for the way of peace.

feet of you (this can include yourself) equal to your

them for 10 minutes or until you use this feature 
again. While any bonded creature is within 30 feet

to 2d6 +your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1 hit 
point). A creature can receive this healing only once 
whenever you take this action.


PROTECTIVE BOND
6th-level Peace Domain feature


The bond you forge between people helps them
protect each other. When a creature affected by your 
Emboldening Bond feature is about to take damage,

damage, the creature has resistance to that damage.

The twilit transition from light into darkness often
brings calm and even joy, as the day's labors end 
and the hours of rest begin. The darkness can also 
bring terrors, but the gods of twilight guard against 
the horrors of the night.


Clerics who serve these deities-examples of
which appear on the Twilight Deities table-bring 
comfort to those who seek rest and protect them by 
venturing into the encroaching darkness to ensure 
that the dark is a comfort, not a terror.

1st-level Twilight Domain feature 
You can see through the deepest gloom. You have 
darkvision out to a range of 300 feet. In that radius, 
you can see in dim light as if it were bright light and 
in darkness as if it were dim light. 
As an action, you can magicall y share the darkvi­
sion of this feature with willing creatures you can

tures equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum

you give one creature you touch (including possibly 
yourself) advantage on the next initiative roll the 
creature makes. This benefit ends immediately after 
the roll or if you use this feature again. 
CHANNEL DIVINITY: TWILIGHT SANCTU ARY 
2nd-level Twilight Domain feature


You can use your Channel Divinity to refresh your
allies with soothing twilight. 
As an action, you present your holy symbol, and a 
sphere of twilight emanates from you. The sphere 
is centered on you, has a 30-foot radius, and is filled 
with dim light. The sphere moves with you, and it 
lasts for 1 minute or until you are incapacitated or 
die. Whenever a creature (including you) ends its 
turn in the sphere, you can grant that creature one 
of these benefits: 
• You grant it temporary hit points equal to ld6 plus 
your cleric level. 
• You end one effect on it causing it to be charmed 
or frightened.


STEPS OF NIGHT
6th-level Twilight Domain feature


You can draw on the mystical power of night to rise

OPTIONAL CLASS FEA TURES
You gain class features in the Player's Handbook 
when you reach certain levels in your class. This 
section offers additional features that you can gain 
as a druid. Unlike the features in the Player's Hand­
book, you don't gain the features here automat ically. 
Consulting with your DM, you decide whether to 
gain a feature in this section if you meet the level re­
quirement noted in the feature's description. These 
features can be selected separately from one an­
other; you can use some, all, or none of them.

36 CHAP TER I I CHARA CTER OPTIONSTA�HA Druids of the Circle of Spores find beauty in decay.


They see within mold and other fungi the ability
to transform lifeless material into abundant, albeit 
somewhat strange, life. These druids believe that 
life and death are parts of a grand cycle, with one 
leading to the other and then back again. Death isn't 
the end of life, but instead a change of state that 
sees life shift into a new form.


Druids of this circle have a complex relationship
with the undead. They see nothing inherently wrong 
with undeath, which they consider to be a compan­
ion to life and death. But these druids believe that 
the natural cycle is healthiest when each segment 
of it is vibrant and changing. Undead that seek to 
replace all life with undeath, or that try to avoid 
passing to a final rest, violate the cycle and must 
be thwarted.


CIRCLE SPELLS
2nd-level Circle of Spores feature


Your symbiotic link to fungi and your ability to tap
into the cycle of life and death grants you access 
to certain spells. At 2nd level, you learn the chill 
touch cantrip. 
At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level you gain access to 
the spells listed for that level in the Circle of Spores 
Spells table. Once you gain access to one of these 
spells, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't 
count against the number of spells you can prepare 
each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn't 
appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonethe­
less a druid spell for you.

HALO OF SPORES
2nd-level Circle of Spores feature 
You are surrounded by invisible, necrotic spores 
that are harmless until you unleash them on a crea­
ture nearby. When a creature you can see moves 
into a space within 10 feet of you or starts its turn 
there, you can use your reaction to deal ld4 necrotic 
damage to that creature unless it succeeds on a


Constitution saving throw against your spell save
DC. The necrotic damage increases to ld6 at 6th 
level, ld8 at 10th level, and ldlO at 14th level.


SYMBIOTIC ENTITY
2nd-level Circle of Spores feature


You gain the ability to channel magic into your
spores. As an action, you can expend a use of your 
Wild Shape feature to awaken those spores, rather 
than transforming into a beast form, and you gain 4 
temporary hit points for each level you have in this 
class. While this feature is active, you gain the fol­
lowing benefits: 
• When you deal your Halo of Spores damage, 
roll the damage die a second time and add it to 
the total. 
• Your melee weapon attacks deal an extra ld6 ne-
crotic damage to any target they hit. 
These benefits last for 10 minutes, until you lose 
all these temporary hit points, or until you use your 
Wild Shape again.


FUNGAL INFESTATION
6th-level Circle of Spores feature


Your spores gain the ability to infest a corpse and
animate it. If a beast or a humanoid that is Small 
or Medium dies within 10 feet of you, you can use 
your reaction to animate it, causing it to stand up 
immedia tely with 1 hit point. The creature uses 
the Zombie stat block in the Monster Manual. It 
remains animate for 1 hour, after which time it col­
lapses and dies. In combat, the zombie's turn comes immedia tely 
after yours. It obeys your mental commands, and 
the only action it can take is the Attack action, mak­
ing one melee attack.


You can use this feature a number of times equal
to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and 
you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a 
long rest.


SPREADING SPORES
10th-level Circle of Spores feature


You gain the ability to seed an area with deadly
spores. As a bonus action while your Symbiotic 
Entity feature is active, you can hurl spores up to 
30 feet away, where they swirl in a 10-foot cube for 
1 minute. The spores disappear early if you use 
this feature again, if you dismiss them as a bonus 
action, or if your Symbiotic Entity feature is no lon­
ger active.


Whenever a creature moves into the cube or
starts its turn there, that creature takes your Halo 
of Spores damage, unless the creature succeeds on 
a Constitution saving throw against your spell save 
DC. A creature can take this damage no more than 
once per turn. 
While the cube of spores persists, you can't use 
your Halo of Spores reaction.

The Circle of Stars allows druids to draw on the
power of starlight. These druids have tracked heav­
enly patterns since time immemorial, discovering 
secrets hidden amid the constellations. By revealing 
and understa nding these secrets, the Circle of the 
Stars seeks to harness the powers of the cosmos. 
Many druids of this circle keep records of the con­
stellations and the stars' effects on the world. Some 
groups document these observations at megalithic 
sites, which serve as enigmatic libraries of lore. 
These repositories might take the form of stone cir­
cles, pyramids, petroglyphs, and underground tem­
ples-any construction durable enough to protect 
the circle's sacred knowledge even against a great 
cataclysm. 
38 CHAP TER 1 I CHA RACTER OPTIONSSTAR MAP 
2nd-level Circle of the Stars feature


You've created a star chart as part of your heavenly
studies. It is a Tiny object and can serve as a spell­
casting focus for your druid spells. You determine 
its form by rolling on the Star Map table or by 
choosing one. 
While holding this map, you have these benefits: 
• You know the guidance cantrip. 
• You have the guiding bolt spell prepared. It 
counts as a druid spell for you, and it doesn't 
count against the number of spells you can 
have prepared . 
• You can cast guiding bolt without expending a 
spell slot. You can do so a number of times equal 
to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all ex­
pended uses when you finish a long rest. 
If you lose the map, you can perform a 1-hour cer­
emony to magically create a replacement. This cere­
mony can be performed during a short or Jong rest, 
and it destroys the previous map.

6 Glass disks that depict constellations


STARRY FORM
2nd-level Circle of the Stars feature 
As a bonus action, you can expend a use of your 
Wild Shape feature to take on a starry form, rather 
than transforming into a beast. 
While in your starry form, you retain your game 
statistics, but your body becomes luminous; your 
joints glimmer like stars, and glowing lines connect 
them as on a star chart. This form sheds bright light 
in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 
10 feet. The form lasts for 10 minutes. It ends early 
if you dismiss it (no action required), are incapaci­
tated, die, or use this feature again. ·Whenever you assume your starry form, choose
which of the following constellations glimmers on 
your body; your choice gives you certain benefits 
while in the form: 
Archer. A constellation of an archer appears on 
you. When you activate this form, and as a bonus 
action on your subsequent turns while it lasts, you 
can make a ranged spell attack, hurling a lumi-
nous arrow that targets one creature within 60 
feet of you. On a hit, the attack deals radiant dam­
age equal to ld8 +your Wisdom modifier. 
Chalice. A constellation of a life-giving goblet ap­
pears on you. Whenever you cast a spell using 
a spell slot that restores hit points to a creature, 
you or another creature within 30 feet of you 
can regain hit points equal to ld8 +your Wis­
dom modifier . 
Dragon. A constella tion of a wise dragon appears 
on you. When you make an Intelligence or a Wis­
dom check or a Constitution saving throw to main­
tain concentration on a spell, you can treat a roll 
of 9 or lower on the d20 as a 10.


COSMIC OMEN
6th-level Circle of the Stars feature 
Whenever you finish a long rest, you can consult 
your Star Map for omens. When you do so, roll a 
die. Until you finish your next long rest, you gain 
access to a special reaction based on whether you 
rolled an even or an odd number on the die: 
Weal (even). Whenever a creature you can see 
within 30 feet of you is about to make an attack 
roll, a saving throw, or an ability check, you can 
use your reaction to roll a d6 and add the number 
rolled to the total. 
Woe (odd). Whenever a creature you can see within 
30 feet of you is about to make an attack roll, a 
saving throw, or an ability check, you can use 
your reaction to roll a d6 and subtract the number 
rolled from the total.


You can use this reaction a number of times equal
to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all ex­
pended uses when you finish a long rest. TWINKLING CONSTELLATIONS 
10th-level Circle of the Stars feature 
The constellations of your Starry Form improve. 
The ld8 of the Archer and the Chalice becomes 
2d8, and while the Dragon is active, you have a fly­
ing speed of 20 feet and can hover. 
Moreover, at the start of each of your turns while 
in your Starry Form, you can change which constel­
lation glimmers on your body.


FULL OF STARS
14th-level Circle of the Stars feature 
While in your Starry Form, you become partially

TASHA
Druids within the Circle of Wildfire understand that 
destruction is sometimes the precursor of creation, 
such as when a forest fire promotes later growth.


These druids bond with a primal spirit that harbors
both destructive and creative power, allowing the 
druids to create controlled flames that burn away 
one thing but give life to another.


CIRCLE SPELLS
2nd-level Circle of Wildfire feature 
You have formed a bond with a wildfire spirit, a 
primal being of creation and destruction. Your link 
with this spirit grants you access to some spells 
when you reach certain levels in this class, as 
shown on the Circle of Wildfire Spells table. 
Once you gain access to one of these spells, you 
always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against 
the number of spells you can prepare each day. If 
you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on 
the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid 
spell for you.

2nd-level Circle of Wildfire feature


You can summon the primal spirit bound to your

Wild Shape feature to summon your wildfire spirit, 
rather than assuming a beast form.


The spirit appears in an unoccupied space of your
choice that you can see within 30 feet of you. Each 
creature within 10 feet of the spirit (other than you) 
when it appears must succeed on a Dexterity sav­
ing throw against your spell save DC or take 2d6 
fire damage.


The spirit is friendly to you and your companions
and obeys your commands. See this creature's 
game statistics in the Wildfire Spirit stat block, 
which uses your proficiency bonus (PB) in several 
places. You determine the spirit's appearance. Some 
spirits take the form of a humanoid figure made of 
gnarled branches covered in flame, while others 
look like beasts wreathed in fire.

one in its stat block or some other action. If you are 
incapacitated, the spirit can take any action of its 
choice, not just Dodge. 
The spirit manifests for 1 hour, until it is reduced 
to 0 hit points, until you use this feature to summon 
the spirit again, or until you die.

The bond with your wildfire spirit enhances your de­
structive and restorative spells. Whenever you cast 
a spell that deals fire damage or restores hit points 
while your wildfire spirit is summoned, roll a d8, 
and you gain a bonus equal to the number rolled to 
one damage or healing roll of the spell. 
In addition, when you cast a spell with a range 
other than self, the spell can originate from you or 
your wildfire spirit.


CAUTE RIZING FLAMES
10th-level Circle of Wildfire feature


You gain the ability to turn death into magical
flames that can heal or incinerate. When a Small 
or larger creature dies withiff 30 feet of you or your 
wildfire spirit, a harmless spectral flame springs 
forth in the dead creature's space and flickers there 
for 1 minute. When a creature you can see enters 
that space, you can use your reaction to extinguish 
the spectral flame there and either heal the creature 
or deal fire damage to it. The healing or damage 
equals 2d10 +your Wisdom modifier.


You can use this reaction a number of times equal
to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all ex­
pended uses when you finish a long rest.


BLAZING REVIVAL
14th-level Circle of Wildfire feature


The bond with your wildfire spirit can save you from
death. If the spirit is within 120 feet of you when 
you are reduced to 0 hit points and thereby fall un­
conscious, you can cause the spirit to drop to 0 hit 
points. You then regain half your hit points and im­
mediately rise to your feet. 
· Once you use this feature, you can't use it again 
until you finish a long rest.


FIGH TER
The fighter class receives new features and sub­
classes in this section. I


OPTION AL CLASS FEA TURE S
You gain class features in the Player's Handbook 
when you reach certain levels in your class. This 
section offers additional features that you can gain 
as a fighter. Unlike the features in the Player's 
Handbook, you don't gain the features here automat­
ically. Consulting with your DM, you decide whether 
to gain a feature in this section if you meet the level 
requirement noted in the feature's description.


These features can be selected separately from one
another; you can use some, all, or none of them.


FIGHTING STYLE OPTIONS

styles are added to your list of options. BLIND FIGHTING 
You have blindsight with a range of 10 feet. Within 
that range, you can effectively see anything that isn't 
behind total cover, even if you're blinded or in dark­
ness. Moreover, you can see an invisible creature 
within that range, unless the creature successfully 
hides from you.


INTERCEPTION
When a creature you can see hits a target, other 
than you, within 5 feet of you with an attack, you can 
use your reaction to reduce the damage the target 
takes by ldlO +your proficiency bonus (to a mini­
mum of 0 damage). You must be wielding a shield or 
a simple or martial weapon to use this reaction.


SUPERIOR TECHNIQUE
You learn one maneuver of your choice from among 
those available to the Battle Master archetype. If a 
maneuver you use requires your target to make a 
saving throw to resist the maneuver's effects, the 
saving throw DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus 
+your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice). 
You gain one superiority die, which is a d6 (this 
die is added to any superiority dice you have from 
another source). This die is used to fuel your maneu­
vers. A superiority die is expended when you use it.


You regain your expended superiority dice when you
finish a short or long rest.


THROWN WEAPON FIGHTING
You can draw a weapon that has the thrown prop­
erty as part of the attack you make with the weapon. 
In addition, when you hit with a ranged attack 
using a thrown weapon, you gain a +2 bonus to the 
damage roll.


UNARMED FIGHTING
Your unarmed strikes can deal bludgeoning damage 
equal to ld6 +your Strength modifier on a hit. If you 
aren't wielding any weapons or a shield when you 
make the attack rol l, the d6 becomes a d8. 
At the start of each of your turns, you can deal 
ld4 bludgeoning damage to one creature grap­
pled by you.


MART IAL VERSA TILITY
4th-level fighter feature


Whenever you reach a level in this class that grants

ter archetype, you can replace one maneuver you 
know with a different maneuver.


MANEUVER OPTIONS
If you have access to maneuvers, the following ma­

you. Maneuvers are available to Battle Masters but 
also to characters who have a special feature like 
the Superior Technique fighting style or the Martial

initiative roll, you can expend one superiority die 
and add the die to the roll, provided you aren't in­
capacitated.


BAIT AND SWITCH
When you're within 5 feet of a creature on your 
turn, you can expend one superiority die and switch 
places with that creature, provided you spend at 
least 5 feet of movement and the creature is willing 
and isn't incapacitated. This movement doesn't pro­
voke opportunity attacks. 
Roll the superiority die. Until the start of your next 
turn, you or the other creature (your choice) gains a 
bonus to AC equal to the number rolled. 
42 CHAP TER 1 I CHARA CTER OPTIONSBRACE


When a creature you can see moves into the reach
you have with the melee weapon you're wielding,

wArrior\ ri�htl� A�\wer, "Wh� Mt both?" 
TA�l/A 
Awake to the psionic power within, a Psi Warrior 
is a fighter who augments their physical might 
with psi-infused weapon strikes, telekinetic lashes, 
and barriers of mental force. Many githyanki 
train to become such warriors, as do some of the 
most disciplined high elves. In the world ofEber­
ron, many young kalashtar dream of becoming 
Psi Warriors. 
As a Psi Warrior, you might have honed your 
psionic abilities through solo discipline, unlocked 
it under the tutelage of a master, or refined it at an 
academy dedicated to wielding the mind's power as 
both weapon and shield.


PsIONIC PowER
3rd-level Psi Warrior feature


You harbor a wellspring of psionic energy within
yourself. This energy is represented by your 
Psionic Energy dice, which are each a d6. You 
have a number of these dice equal to twice your 
proficiency bonus, and they fuel various psionic 
powers you have, which are detailed below. 
Some of your powers expend the Psionic En­
ergy die they use, as specified in a power's de­
scription, and you can't use a power if it requires 
you to use a die when your dice are all expended.


You regain all your expended Psionic Energy dice
when you finish a long rest. In addition, as a bo­
nus action, you can regain one expended Psionic 
Energy die, but you can't do so again until you 
finish a short or long rest. 
When you reach certain levels in this class, the 
size of your Psionic Energy dice increases: at 5th 
level (d8), 11th level (dlO), and 17th level (dl2).


The powers below use your Psionic
Energy dice. 
Protect ive Field. When you or another crea-
ture you can see within 30 feet of you takes damage, 
you can use your reaction to expend one Psionic En­
ergy die, roll the die, and reduce the damage taken 
by the number rolled plus your Intelligence modifier 
(minimum reduction of 1), as you create a momen­
tary shield of telekinetic force. 
Psionic Strike. You can propel your weapons 
with psionic force. Once on each of your turns, im­
mediately after you hit a target within 30 feet of you 
with an attack and deal damage to it with a weapon, 
you can expend one Psionic Energy die, rolling it 
and dealing force damage to the target equal to the 
number rolled plus your Intelligence modifier. 
Telekine tic Movem ent. You can move an object 
or a creature with your mind. As an action, you 
target one loose object that is Large or smaller or 
one willing creature, other than yourself . If you can 
see the target and it is within 30 feet of you, you 
can move it up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space 
you can see. Alternat ively, if it is a Tiny object, you 
can move it to or from your hand. Either way, you 
can move the target horizontall y, vertically, or both. 
Once you take this action, you can't do so again un­
til you finish a short or long rest, unless you expend 
a Psionic Energy die to take it again. TELEKINE TIC ADEPT 
7th-level Psi Warrior feature


You have mastered new ways to use your telekinetic
abilities, detailed below. 
Psi- Powered Leap. As a bonus action, you can 
propel your body with your mind. You gain a flying 
speed equal to twice your walking speed until the 
end of the current turn. Once you take this bonus 
action, you can't do so again until you finish a short 
or long rest, unless you expend a Psionic Energy die 
to take it again. 
Telekine tic Thrust. When you deal damage to a 
target with your Psionic Strike, you can force the 
target to make a Strength saving throw against a 
DC equal to 8 +your proficiency bonus+ your Intel­
ligence modifier. If the save fails, you can knock the 
target prone or move it up to 10 feet in any direction 
horizontall y.


GUARDED MIND
10th-level Psi Warrior feature 
The psionic energy flowing through you has bol­
stered your mind. You have resistance to psychic 
damage. Moreover, if you start your turn charmed or 
frightened, you can expend a Psionic Energy die and 
end every effect on yourself subjecting you to those 
conditions. 
CHAPTER 1 I CHA RACTER OPTIONS 43


BULWARK OF FORCE
15th-level Psi Warrior feature


You can shield yourself and others with telekinetic
force. As a bonus action, you can choose creatures, 
which can include you, that you can see within 30 
feet of you, up to a ·number of creatures equal to 
your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one crea­
ture). Each of the chosen creatures is protected by 
half cover for 1 minute or until you're incapacitated. 
Once you take this bonus action, you can't do so 
again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend 
a Psionic Energy die to take it again.


TELEKINE TIC MASTER
J8th-level Psi Warrior feature


Your ability to move creatures and objects with your
mind is matched by few. You can cast the telekinesis 
spell, requiring no components, and your spellcast­
ing ability for the spell is Intelligence. On each of 
your turns while you concentrate on the spell, in­
cluding the turn when you cast it, you can make one 
attack with a weapon as a bonus action. 
Once you cast the spell with this feature, you can't 
do so again until you finish a long rest, unless you 
expend a Psionic Energy die to cast it again.

Rune Knights enhance their martial prowess using
the supernatural power of runes, an ancient prac­
tice that originated with giants. Rune cutters can 
be found among any family of giants, and you likely 
learned your methods first or second hand from 
such a mystical artisan. Whether you found the gi­
ant's work carved into a hill or cave, learned of the 
runes from a sage, or met the giant in person, you 
studied the giant's craft and learned how to apply 
magic runes to empower your equipment.


BONUS PROFICIENCIES
3rd-level Rune Knight feature 
You gain proficiency with smith's tools, and you 
learn to speak, read, and write Giant.


RUNE CARVER
3rd-level Rune KniSht feature

You learn two runes of your choice, from among 
the runes described below, and each time you gain 
a level in this class, you can replace one rune you

you reach certain levels in this class, you learn addi­
tional runes, as shown in the Runes Known table.

Whenever you finish a long rest, you can touch a 
number of objects equal to the number of runes you 
know, and you inscribe a different rune onto each 
of the objects. To be eligible, an object must be a 
weapon, a suit of armor, a shield, a piece of jewelry, 
or something else you can wear or hold in a hand.


Your rune remains on an object until you finish a
long rest, and an ob ject can bear only one of your 
runes at a time.


The following runes are available to you when you
learn a rune. If a rune has a level requirement, you 
must be at least that level in this class to learn the 
rune. If a rune requires a saving throw, your Rune 
Magic save DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + 
your Constitution modifier. 
Cloud Rune. This rune emulates the deceptive 
magic used by some cloud giants. While wearing 
or carrying an object inscribed with this rune, 
you have advantage on Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) 
checks and Charisma (Deception) checks. 
In addition, when you or a creature you can see 
within 30 feet of you is hit by an attack roll, you can 
use your reaction to invoke the rune and choose a 
different creature within 30 feet of you, other than 
the attacker. The chosen creature becomes the tar­
get of the attack, using the same roll. This magic 
can transfer the attack's effects regardless of the 
attack's range. Once you invoke this rune, you can't 
do so again until you finish a short or long rest. 
Fire Rune. This rune's magic channels the mas­
terful craftsmanship of great smiths. While wearing 
or carrying an object inscribed with this rune, your 
proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check 
you make that uses your proficiency with a tool. 
In addition, when you hit a creature with an at­
tack using a weapon, you can invoke the rune to 
summon fiery shackles: the target takes an extra 
2d6 fire damage, and it must succeed on a Strength 
saving throw or be restrained for 1 minute. While 
restrained by the shackles, the target takes 2d6 fire 
damage at the start of each of its turns. The target 
can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its 
turns, banishing the shackles on a success. Once 
you invoke this rune, you can't do so again until you 
finish a short or long rest. 
Frost Rune. This rune's magic evokes the might 
of those who survive in the wintry wilderness, such 
as frost giants. While wearing or carrying an object 
inscribed with this rune, you have advantage on 
Wisdom (Animal Handling) checks and Charisma 
(Intimidation) checks. 
In addition, you can invoke the rune as a bonus 
action to increase your sturdiness. For 10 minutes, 
you gain a +2 bonus to all ability checks and saving 
throws that use Strength or Constitution. Once you 
invoke this rune, you can't do so again until you fin­
ish a short or long rest. 
Stone Rune. This rune's magic channels the judi­
ciousness associated with stone giants. While wear­
ing or carrying an object inscribed with this rune, 
you have advantage on Wisdom (Insight) checks, 
and you have darkvision out to a range of 120 feet. 
In addition, when a creature you can see ends its 
turn within 30 feet of you, you can use your reaction 
to invoke the rune and force the creature to make 
a Wisdom saving throw. Unless the save succeeds, 
the creature is charmed by you for 1 minute. While 
charmed in this way, the creature has a speed of 
0 and is incapacitated, descending into a dreamy 
stupor. The creature repeats the saving throw at 
the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a 
success. Once you invoke this rune, you can't do so 
again until you finish a short or long rest. 
Hill Rune (7th Level or Hig her). This rune's 
magic bestows a resilience reminiscent of a hill gi­
ant. While wearing or carrying an object that bears 
this rune, you have advantage on saving throws 
against being poisoned, and you have resistance 
against poison damage. 
In addition, you can invoke the rune as a bonus 
action, gaining resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, 
and slashing damage for 1 minute. Once you invoke 
this rune, you can't do so again until you finish a 
short or long rest. 
Storm Rune (7th Lev el or Hig her). Using this 
rune, you can glimpse the future like a storm giant 
seer. While wearing or carrying an object inscribed 
with this rune, you have advantage on Intelligence 
(Arcana) checks, and you can't be surprised as long 
as you aren't incapacitated. 
In addition, you can invoke the rune as a bonus 
action to enter a prophetic state for 1 minute or until 
you're incapacitated. Until the state ends, when you 
or another creature you can see within 60 feet of 
you makes an attack roll, a saving throw, or an abil­
ity check, you can use your reaction to cause the roll 
to have advantage or disadvantage. Once you invoke 
this rune, you can't do so again until you finish a 
short or long rest. •i ••

might of giants. As a bonus action, you magicall y 
gain the following benefits, which last for 1 minute:

Large, along with anything you are wearing. If 
you lack the room to become Large, your size

Strength saving throws. 
• Once on each of your turns, one of your attacks 
with a weapon or an unarmed strike can deal an

reach increases by 5 feet.


BATTLE MAS TER BUILDS
A Martial Archetype option in the Player's Hand­
book, the Battle Master showcases just how ver­
satile a fighter can be. The suite of maneuvers you 
choose, when combined with a fighting style and 
feats, allows you to create a broad range of fighters, 
each with its own flavor and play style. Below are 
recommendations for how you might build a Battle 
Master to reflect various types of warriors.


Each of these builds contains suggested fighting
styles, maneuvers, and feats. Those suggestions 
are from the Player's Handbook, except for the ones 
followed by an asterisk, which indicates an option 
introduced in this book.


ARCHER
Fighting Style: Archery 
Maneuvers: Disarming Strike, Distracting Strike,


Precision Attack
Feats: Sharpshooter 
You prefer to deal with your enemies from afar, 
trusting in a well-placed arrow, javelin, or sling 
bullet to end a fight without a response. You rely on 
accuracy and probably subscribe to the axiom that 
"those who live by the sword die by the bow." 
46 CHAPTER 1 I CHARA CTER OPTIONS BODYGUARD 
-------
Fighting Style: Interception,* Protection 
Maneuvers: Bait and Switch,* Disarming Attack, 
Goading Attack, Grappling Strike* 
Feats: Alert, Observant, Sentinel, Tough 
Love, money, or some other obligation motivates you 
to place your own body between harm and the one 
you're sworn to protect. You have honed the ability 
to sniff out potential threats and see your charge 
through dangerous situations.


BRAWLER
Fighting Style: Blind Fighting,* Two-Weapon Fight­
ing, Unarmed Fighting* 
Maneuvers: Ambush,* Disarming Attack, Feinting 
Attack, Pushing Attack, Trip Attack 
Feats: Athlete, Durable, Grappler, Resilient, Shield 
Master, Tavern Brawler, Tough 
When bottles start breaking and chairs start flying, 
you're in your element. You love a good scrap, and 
you've likely seen your share of them. You may or 
may not have formal training, and while others 
might call you a dirty fighter, you're still alive.


DU ELIST
Fighting Style: Dueling, Two-Weapon Fighting 
Maneuvers: Evasive Footwork, Feinting Attack, 
Lunging Attack, Parry, Precision Attack, Riposte 
Feats: Defensive Duelist, Dual Wielder, Observant, 
Savage Attacker, Weapon Master 
You regard the duel as a proud tradition, a test of 
skill and wits that brings honor to those who can de­
feat an enemy while respecting the art. Your search 
for improvement is a consuming passion, and you 
draw on the expertise of the masters who've come 
before you as you work to perfect your form.


GLADIATOR
Fighting Style: Defense, Two-Weapon Fighting 
Maneuvers: Goading Attack, Menacing Attack, 
Sweeping Attack, Trip Attack 
Feats: Athlete, Charger, Dual Wielder, Durable, 
Grappler, Savage Attacker, Tough, Weapon Master 
You've fought to entertain crowds, whether for sport 
or as punishment. Along the way, you learned to use 
all manner of weapons to battle all kinds of adver­
saries. You're practical yet theatrical, and you know 
how to employ fear as an effective tool in a fight.


HO PLITE
Fighting Style: Defense, Thrown Weapon Fighting* 
Maneuvers: Brace,* Lunging Attack, Parry, Preci­
sion Attack 
Feats: Athlete, Grappler , Polearm Master, Sentinel,


Shield Master
With spear and shield, you follow in the footsteps of 
the heroes of ages past. You rely on discipline and 
athle.ticism to overcome improbable odds. Whether 
fighting in ranks alongside your comrades or squar­
ing off as a lone warrior, you're equal to the task.


LAN CER
Fighting Style: Dueling 
Maneuvers: Lunging Attack, Menacing Attack, Pre­
cision Attack, Pushing Attack 
Feats: Heavy Armor Master, Mounted Combatant,


Savage Attacker
When the cavalry is called in, that means you. You 
ride out to greet your enemy with the point of your 
weapon. As you charge, the ground trembles, and 
only the heaviest blows can deter you.


OUTRIDER
Fighting Style: Archery 
Maneuvers: Ambush,* Distracting Strike, Goading 
Attack, Precision Attack, Quick Toss* 
Feats: Alert, Crossbow Expert, Mounted Combat-
ant, Observant, Sharpshooter


You find freedom in the saddle and a companion
in your mount. A headlong charge into combat is a 
blunt instrument for oafs. You prefer mobility and 
range, opting to find advantageous positions that al­
low you to deal with foes at full gallop while evading 
the most dangerous threats.


PUGILIST
Fighting Style: Unarmed Fighting* 
Maneuvers: Disarming Attack, Evasive Footwork, 
Grappling Strike,* Menacing Attack, Pushing At­
tack, Riposte, Trip Attack 
Feats: Athlete, Durable, Grappler, Savage Attacker,


Tavern Brawler
Where others rely on steel, you've got your fists. 
Whether through training or experience, you've 
developed a superior technique that can help you 
overcome an enemy in an up-close fight.


SHOCK TROOPER
Fighting Style: Great Weapon Fighting 
Maneuvers: Menacing Attack, Pushing Attack,


Sweeping Attack
Feats: Charger, Great Weapon Master, Heavy 
Armor Master S ... OCK TROOPER
Subtlety is not your style. You're trained to get 
straight into the fighting, busting through enemy 
lines and applying tremendous pressure quickly. 
Those who ignore you in combat do so at their peril.


SKIRMISHER
Fighting Style: Archery, Thrown Weapon Fighting* 
Maneu vers: Ambush,* Bait and Switch,* Distracting 
Strike, Quick Toss* 
Feats: Alert, Dual Wielder, Mobile, Skulker 
You thrive amid the chaos of battle. You use your 
mobility and versatility in combat to soften your ad­
versaries and disrupt their formations. An enemy's 
plan rarely survives contact with you.


STRATEGIST
Fighting Style: Defense 
Maneuvers: Commander' s Strike, Commanding 
Presence,* Maneuvering Attack, Rally, Tactical 
Assessment* 
Feats: Inspiring Leader, Keen Mind, Linguist 
To you, battles unfold like a game of chess. You un­
derstand that strength and speed are important in 
a fight, but it takes intellect and experience to know 
how best to apply them. That's where you come in.

feature, which offers you the choice of a subclass.


The following options are available to you when
making that choice: Way of Mercy or Way of the 
Astral Self.


WAY OF MERCY
PIA�IAe tAocfor-\oMe look\ �ever �o 01At of 1t�le."


TASHA
Monks of the Way of Mercy learn to manipulate 
the life force of others to bring aid to those in need. 
They are wandering physicians to the poor and hurt. 
However, to those beyond their help, they bring a 
swift end as an act of mercy.


Those who follow the Way of Mercy might be
members of a religious order, administering to the 
needy and making grim choices rooted in reality 
rather than idealism. Some might be gentle-voiced 
healers, beloved by their communities, while others 
might be masked bringers of macabre mercies.


The walkers of this way usually don robes with
deep cowls, and they often conceal their faces with 
masks, presenting themselves as the faceless bring­
ers of life and death.


IMPLEMENTS OF MERCY
3rd-level Way of Mercy feature 
You gain proficiency in the Insight and Medi­
cine skills, and you gain proficiency with the 
herbalism kit. 
You also gain _a special mask, which you often 
wear when using the features of this subclass. You 
determine its appearance, or generate it randomly 
by rolling on the Merciful Mask table. MERCIFUL MASK

turns to life, regaining a number of hit points equal 
to 4d 10 + your Wisdom modifier. If the creature died 
while subject to any of the following conditions, it 
revives with them removed: blinded, deafened, para­

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again 
until you finish a long rest. 
50 CHAP TER I I CHA RACTER OPTIONS WAY OF THE ASTRAL SELF 
Note to \elf: cre1Ate IA lpell th1At let1 �olA thro1At-p1A�ch 
people with �OIAY ,ho1t. 
A monk who follows the Way of the Astral Self be­
lieves their body is an illusion. They see their ki as a 
representation of their true form, an astral self. This 
astral self has the capacity to be a force of order or 
disorder, with some monasteries training students 
to use their power to protect the weak and other 
instructing aspirants in how to manifest their true 
selves in service to the might y.


ARMS OF THE ASTRAL SELF
3rd-level Way of the Astral Self feature


Your mastery of your ki allows you to summon a
portion of your astral self. As a bonus action, you 
can spend 1 ki point to summon the arms of your 
astral self. When you do so, each creature of your 
choice that you can see within 10 feet of you must 
succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take force 
damage equal to two rolls of your Martial Arts die. 
For 10 minutes, these spectral arms hover near 
your shoulders or surround your arms (your choice). 
You determine the arms' appearance, and they van­
ish early if you are incapacitated or die. 
While the spectral arms are present, you gain the 
following benefits: 
• You can use your Wisdom modifier in place of 
your Strength modifier when making Strength 
checks and Strength saving throws. 
• You can use the spectral arms to make un­
armed strikes. 
• When you make an unarmed strike with the arms 
on your turn, your reach for it is 5 feet greater 
than normal. 
• The unarmed strikes you make with the arms 
can use your Wisdom modifier in place of your


Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and
damage rolls, and their damage type is force.


VISAGE OF THE ASTRAL SELF
6th-level Way of the Astral Self feature 
You can summon the visage of your astral self. As a 
bonus action, or as part of the bonus action you take 
to activate Arms of the Astral Self, you can spend 
1 ki point to summon this visage for 10 minutes. It 
vanishes early if you are incapacitated or die.


The spectral visage covers your face like a helmet
or mask. You determine its appearance. 
While the spectral visage is present, you gain the 
following benefits. 
Astral Sight. You can see normally in dark­
ness, both magical and nonmagical, to a distance 
of 120 feet. 
Wisdom of the· Spirit. You have advantage 
on Wisdom (Insight) and Charisma (Intimida­
tion) checks. 
Word of the Spirit. When you speak, you can di­
rect y9ur words to a creature of your choice that you 
can see within 60 feet of you, making it so only that 
creature can hear you. Alternat ively, you can am­
plify your voice so that all creatures within 600 feet 
can hear you.


BODY OF THE ASTRAL SELF
11th-level Way of the Astral Self feature


When you have both your astral arms and visage
summoned, you can cause the body of your astral 
self to appear (no action required). This spectral 
body covers your physical form like a suit of armor, 
connecting with the arms and visage. You deter­
mine its appearance. 
While the spectral body is present, you gain the 
following benefits. 
Defl ect Ener gy. When you take acid, cold, fire, 
force, lightning, or thunder damage, you can use 
your reaction to deflect it. When you do so, the 
damage you take is reduced by ldlO +your Wisdom 
modifier (minimum reduction of 1).
Emp owered Arms. Once on each of your turns 
when you hit a target with the Arms of the As­
tral Self, you can deal extra damage to the 
target equal to your Martial Arts die.


AWAKENED ASTRAL SELF
17th-level Way of the Astral Self 
feature


Your connection to your astral self
is complete, allowing you to un­
leash its full potential. As a bonus 
action, you can spend 5 ki points to 
summon the arms, visage, and body 
of your astral self and awaken it for 
10 minutes. This awakening ends 
early if you are incapacitated or die. 
While your astral self is awakened, 
you gain the following benefits.


DRAGONBORN MONK OF
THE ASTRAL SELF FORMS OF YOUR ASTRAL SELF


The astral self is a translucent embodiment of the
monk's soul. As a result, an astral self can reflect 
aspects of a monk's background, ideals, flaws, and 
bonds, and an astral self doesn't necessarily look any­
thing like the monk. For example, the astral self of a 
lanky human mig ht be reminiscent of a minotaur-the 
strength of which the monk feels within. Similarly, an 
ore monk might manifest gossamer arms and a deli­
cate visage, representing the gentle beauty of the ore's 
soul. Each astral self is unique, and some of the monks 
of this monastic tradition are known more for the 
appearance of their astral self than for their physical 
appearance. 
When choosing this path, consider the quirks that 
define your monk. Are you obsessed with something? 
Are you driven by justice or a selfish desire? Any of 
these motivations could man ifest in the form of your 
astral self. 
Armor ofthe Spirit. You gain a +2 bonus to 
Armor Class. 
Astral Barr age. Whenever you use the Extra At­
tack feature to attack twice, you can instead attack 
three times if all the attacks are made with your 
astral arms.

cism. For the next 10 minutes, you have advantage 
on Strength (Athletics ) and Dexterity (Acrobatics ) 
checks; you can carry, push, drag, and lift twice as 
much weight as normal; and the distance of your 
long and high jumps increases by 10 feet (this extra 
distance costs movement as normal). 
Inspiring Smite. Immediately after you deal dam­
age to a creature with your Divine Smite feature, 
you can use your Channel Divinity as a bonus action 
and distribute temporary hit points to creatures 
of your choice within 30 feet of you, which can in­
clude you. The total number of temporary hit points

the chosen creatures however you like.


AURA OF ALACRITY
7th-level Oath of Glory feature 
You emanate an aura that fills you and your com­
panions with supernatural speed, allowing you to 
race across a battlefield in formation. Your walking 
speed increases by 10 feet. In addition, if you aren't

starts their turn within 5 feet of you increases by 10 
feet until the end of that turn. 
When you reach 18th level in this class, the range 
of the aura increases to 10 feet.


GLORIOUS DEFENSE
15th-level Oath of Glory feature 
You can turn defense into a sudden strike. When 
you or another creature you can see within 10 feet 
of you is hit by an attack roll, you can use your re­
action to grant a bonus to the target's AC against 
that attack, potentially causing it to miss. The bonus 
equals your Charisma modifier (minimum of +l). If 
the attack misses, you can make one weapon attack 
against the attacker as part of this reaction, pro­
vided the attacker is within your weapon's range.

a 5th-level spell slot to use it again.

TASHA
The Oath of the Watchers binds paladins to protect 
mortal realms from the predations of extraplanar 
creatures, many of which can lay waste to mortal 
soldiers. Thus, the Watchers hone their minds, spir­
its, and bodies to be the ultimate weapons against 
such threats.


Paladins who follow the Watchers' oath are ever
vigilant in spotting the influence of extraplanar 
forces, often establishing a network of spies and 
informants to gather information on suspected 
cults. To a Watcher, keeping a healthy suspicion and 
awareness about one's surroundings is as natural as 
wearing armor in battle.


TENETS OF THE WATCHERS
A paladin who assumes the Oath of the Watchers 
swears to safeguard mortal realms from other­
worldly threats. 
Vigilance. The threats you face are cunning, 
powerful, and subversive. Be ever alert for their 
corruption. 
Loyalt y. Never accept gifts or favors from fiends or 
those who truck with them. Stay true to your order, 
your comrades, and your duty. 
Disci plin e. You are the shield against the endless 
terrors that lie beyond the stars. Your blade must be 
forever sharp and your mind keen to survive what 
lies beyond.

Watcher's Will. You can use your Channel Divin­
ity to invest your presence with the warding power 
of your faith. As an action, you can choose a number 
of creatures you can see within 30 feet of you, up 
to a number equal to your Charisma modifier (min­
imum of one creature). For 1 minute, you and the 
chosen creatures have advantage on Intelligence, 
Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws. 
Abjure the Extrapla nar. You can use your Chan­
nel Divinity to castigate unworldly beings. As an 
action, you present your holy symbol and each 
aberration, celestial, elemental, fey, or fiend within 
30 feet of you that can hear you must make a Wis­
dom saving th row. On a failed save, the creature is 
turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage.


A turned creature must spend its turns trying to
move as far away from you as it can, and it can't 
willingly end its move in a space within 30 feet of 
you. For its action, it can use only the Dash action

58 CHAPTER 1 I CHARA CTER OPTIONS represents both the mortal and the fey realms. As 
you wander the multiverse, your joyful laughter 
brightens the hearts of the downtrodden, and your 
martial prowess strikes terror in your foes, for great 
is the mirth of the fey and dreadful is their fury.


DREADFUL STRIKES
3rd-level Fey Wanderer feature


You can augment your weapon strikes with
mind-scarring magic, drawn from the gloomy hol­
lows of the Feywild. When you hit a creature with a 
weapon, you can deal an extra ld4 psychic damage 
to the target, which can take this extra damage only 
once per turn. 
The extra damage increases to ld6 when you 
reach 11th level in this class.


FEY WANDERER MAGIC
3rd-level Fey Wanderer feature 
You learn an additional spell when you reach cer­
tain levels in this class, as shown in the Fey Wan­
derer Spells table. Each spell counts as a ranger 
spell for you, but it doesn't count against the number 
of ranger spells you know.

5 Horns or antlers sprout from your head. 
6 Your skin and hair change color to match the sea­

OTHER WORLDL Y GLAMOUR
3rd-level Fey Wanderer feature 
Your fey qualities give you a supernatural charm. 
As a result, whenever you make a Charisma check, 
you gain a bonus to the check equal to your Wisdom 
modifier (minimum of +l). 
In addition, you gain proficiency in one of the 
following skills of your choice: Deception, Perfor­
mance, or Persuasion.


BEGUILING TWIST
7th-level Fey Wanderer feature 
The magic of the Feywild guards your mind. You 
have advantage on saving throws against being 
charmed or frightened. 
In addition, whenever you or a creature you can 
see within 120 feet of you succeeds on a saving 
throw against being charmed or frightened, you can 
use your reaction to force a different creature you 
can see within 120 feet of you to make a Wisdom 
saving throw against your spell save DC. If the save 
fails, the target is charmed or frightened by you 
(your choice) for 1 minute. The target can repeat the 
saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending 
the effect on itself on a successful save.


FEY REINFORCEMENTS
11th-level Fey Wanderer feature


The royal courts of the Feywild have blessed you
with the assistance of fey beings: you know summon 
fey (a spell in chapter 3). It doesn't count against the 
number of ranger spells you know, and you can cast 
it without a material component. You can also cast it 
once without a spell slot, and you regain the ability 
to do so when you finish a long rest. 
Whenever you start casting the spell, you can 
modify it so that it doesn't require concentration. If 
you do so, the spell's duration becomes 1 minute for 
that casting.


MISTY WANDERER
15th-level Fey Wanderer feature


You can slip in and out of the Feywild to move in
a blink of an eye: you can cast misty step without 
expending a spell slot. You can do so a number of 
times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 
once), and you regain all expended uses when you 
finish a long rest. 
In addition, whenever you cast misty step, you can 
bring along one willing creature you can see within 
5 feet of you. That creature teleports to an unoccu­
pied space of your choice within 5 feet of your desti­
nation space. GNOME

TASHA
Feeling a deep connection to the environment 
around them, some rangers reach out through their 
magical connection to the world and bond with a 
swarm of nature spirits. The swarm becomes a po­
tent force in battle, as well as helpful company for 
the ranger. Some Swarmkeepers are outcasts or 
hermits, keeping to themselves and their attendant 
swarms rather than dealing with the discomfort of 
others. Other Swarmkeepers enjoy building vibrant 
communities that work for the mutual benefit of all 
those they consider part of their swarm. 
CHAPTER 1 I CHARA CTER OPTIONS 59


GATHERED SWARM
3rd-level Swarmkeeper feature


A swarm of intangible nature spirits has bonded
itself to you and can assist you in battle. Until you 
die, the swarm remains in your space, crawling on 
you or flying and skittering around you within your 
space. You determine its appearance, or you gener­
ate its appearance by rolling on the Swarm Appear­
ance table.

Once on each of your turns, you can cause the 
swarm to assist you in one of the following ways, 
immedia tely after you hit a creature with an attack: 
• The attack's target takes ld6 piercing damage 
from the swarm . 
• The attack's tar get must succeed on a Strength 
saving throw against your spell save DC or be 
moved by the swarm up to 15 feet horizontally in a 
direction of your choice. 
• You are moved by the swarm 5 feet horizontally in 
a direction of your choice.


SWARMKEEPER MAGIC
3rd-level Swarmkeeper feature


You learn the mage hand cantrip if you don't already
know it. When you cast it, the hand takes the form 
of your swarming nature spirits. 
You also learn an additional spell of 1st level or 
higher when you reach certain levels in this class, as 
shown in the Swarmkeeper Spells table. Each spell 
counts as a ranger spell for you, but it doesn't count 
against the number of ranger spells you know.

A Swarmkeeper's swarm and spells are reflections
of the character's bond with nature spirits. Take the 
opportunity to describe the swarm and the ranger's 
magic in play. For example, when your ranger casts 
gaseous form, they might appear to melt into the 
swarm, instead of a cloud of mist, or the arcane eye 
spell could create an extension of your swarm that 
spies for you. Such descriptions don't change the ef­
fects of spells, but they are an exciting opportunity to 
explore your character's narrative through their class 
abilities. For more guidance on customizing spells, see 
the "Personalizing Spells" section in chapter 3. 
Also, remember that the swarm's appearance is 
yours to customize, and don't feel confined to a single 
appearance. Perhaps the spirits' look changes with the 
ranger's mood or with the seasons. You decide!


WRITHING TIDE
7th-level Swarmkeeper feature


You can condense part of your swarm into a focused
mass that lifts you up. As a bonus action, you gain 
a flying speed of 10 feet and can hover. This effect 
lasts for 1 minute or until you are incapacitated.


You can use this feature a number of times equal
to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all ex­
pended uses when you finish a long rest.


MIGHTY SW ARM
11th-level Swarmkeeper feature 
Your Gathered Swarm grows mightier in the fol­
lowing ways: 
• The damage of Gathered Swarm increases to ld8. 
• If a creature fails its saving throw against being 
moved by Gathered Swarm, you can also cause 
the swarm to knock the creature prone. 
• When you are moved by Gathered Swarm, it gives 
you half cover until the start of your next turn.


SWARMING DISPERSAL
15th-level Swarmkeeper feature 
You can discorporate into your swarm, avoi ding 
danger. When you take damage, you can use your 
reaction to give yourself resistance to that damage.


You vanish into your swarm and then teleport to an
unoccupied space that you can see within 30 feet of 
you, where you reappear with the swarm.


You can use this feature a number of times equal
to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all ex­
pended uses when you finish a long rest.


BEAST MAS TER CO MP AN IONS
The Beast Master in the Player's Handbook forms 
a mystical bond with an animal. As an alternative, 
a Beast Master can take the feature below to form a 
bond with a special primal beast instead.


PRIMAL COMPANION
3rd-level Beast Master feature, which replaces the


Ranger's Companion feature
You magically summon a primal beast, which draws 
strength from your bond with nature. The beast 
is friendly to you and your companions and obeys 
your commands. Choose its stat block-Beast of the 
Land, Beast of the Sea, or Beast of the Sky-which 
uses your proficiency bonus (PB) in several places.


You also determine the kind of animal the beast
is, choosing a kind appropriate for the stat block. 
Whatever kind you choose, the beast bears primal 
markings, indicating its mystical origin. 
In combat, the beast acts during your turn. It can 
move and use its reaction on its own, but the only 
action it takes is the Dodge action, unless you take 
a bonus action on your turn to command it to take 
another action. That action can be one in its stat 
block or some other action. You can also sacrifice 
one of your attacks when you take the Attack action 
to command the beast to take the Attack action. If 
you are incapacitated, the beast can take any action 
of its choice, not just Dodge. 
If the beast has died within the last hour, you can 
use your action to touch it and expend a spell slot of

OPTIONAL CLASS FEA TURE
You gain class features in the Player's Handbook 
when you reach certain levels in your class. This 
section offers an additional feature that you can gain 
as a rogue. Unlike the features in the Player's Hand­
book, you don't gain the feature here automatical ly. 
Consulting with your DM, you decide whether to 
gain the feature in this section if you meet the level 
requirement noted in the feature's description.


STEADY AIM
3rd-level rogue feature 
As a bonus action, you give yourself advantage on 
your next attack roll on the current turn. You can 
use this bonus action only if you haven't moved 
during this turn, and after you use the bonus action, 
your speed is 0 until the end of the current turn.

Many rogues walk a fine line between life and
death, risking their own lives and taking the lives of 
others. While adventuring on that line, some rogues 
discover a mystical connection to death itself. These 
rogues take knowledge from the dead and become 
immersed in negative energy, eventually becoming 
like ghosts. Thieves' guilds value them as highly ef­
fective information gatherers and spies.


Many shadar-kai of the Shadowfell are masters
of these macabre techniques, and some are willing 
to teach this path. In places like Thay in the Forgot­
ten Realms and Karrnath in Eberron, where many 
necromancers practice their craft, a Phantom can 
become a wizard's confidant and right hand. In tem­
ples of gods of death, the Phantom might work as 
an agent to track down those who try to cheat death 
and to recover knowledge that might otherwise be 
lost to the grave. 
How did you discover this grim power? Did 
you sleep in a graveyard and awaken to your new 
abilities? Or did you cultivate them in a temple or 
thieves' guild dedicated to a deity of death?


WHISPERS OF THE DEAD
3rd-level Phantom feature 
Echoes of those who have died cling to you. When­
ever you finish a short or long rest, you can choose 
one skill or tool proficiency that you lack and gain 
it, as a ghostly presence shares its knowledg e with 
you. You lose this proficiency when you use this fea­
ture to choose a different proficiency that you lack.


WAILS FROM THE GRAVE
3rd-level Phantom feature 
As you nudge someone closer to the grave, you can 
channel the power of death to harm someone else 
as well. Immedia tely after you deal your Sneak 
Attack damage to a creature on your turn, you can 
target a second creature that you can see within 
30 feet of the first creature. Roll half the number of 
Sneak Attack dice for your level (round up), and the 
second creature takes necrotic damage equal to the 
roll's total, as wails of the dead sound around them 
for a moment.


You can use this feature a number of times equal
to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all ex­
pended uses when you finish a long rest.


TOKENS OF THE DEPARTED
9th-level Phantom feature 
When a life ends in your presence, you're able to 
snatc\1 a token from the departing soul, a sliver of 
its life essence that takes physical form: as a reac­
tion when a creature you can see dies within 30 
feet of you, you can open your free hand and cause 
a Tiny trinket to appear there, a soul trinket. The


DM determines the trinket's form or has you roll
on the Trinkets table in the Player's Handbook to 
generate it.


You can have a maximum number of soul trinkets
equal to your proficiency bonus, and you can't create 
one while at your maximum. 
You can use soul trinkets in the following ways: 
• While a soul trinket is on your person, you have 
advantage on death saving throws and Constitu­
tion saving throws, for your vitality is enhanced by 
the life essence within the object. 
• When you deal Sneak Attack damage on your 
turn, you can destroy one of your soul trinkets 
that's on your person and then immediately use 
Wails from the Grave, without expending a use of 
that feature. 
• As an action, you can dest roy one of your soul 
trinkets, no matter where it's located. When you 
do so, you can ask the spirit associated with the 
trinket one question. The spirit appears to you 
and answers in a language it knew in life. It's un­
der no obligation to be truthful, and it answers as 
concisely as possible, eager to be free. The spirit 
knows only what it knew in life, as determined 
by the DM.


GHOST WALK
13th-level Phantom feature 
You can phase partially into the realm of the dead, 
becoming like a ghost. As a bonus action, you as­
sume a spectral form. While in this form, you have 
a flying speed of 10 feet, you can hover, and attack 
rolls have disadvantage against you. You can also 
move through creatures and objects as if they were 
difficult terrain, but you take ldlO force damage if 
you end your turn inside a creature or an object. 
You stay in this form for 10 minutes or until you 
end it as a bonus action. To use this feature again, 
you must finish a long rest or destroy one of your 
soul trinkets as part of the bonus action you use to 
activate Ghost Walk. DEATH'S FRIEND 
17th-level Phantom feature


Your association with death has become so close
that you gain the following benefits: 
• When you use your Wails from the Grave, you can 
deal the necrotic damage to both the first and the 
second creature. 
• At the end of a long rest, a soul trinket appears in 
your hand if you don't have any soul trinkets, as 
the spirits of the dead are drawn to you.


SOULKNIFE

J TASHA
Most assassins strike with physical weapons, 
and many burglars and spies use thieves' tools to 
infiltrate secure locations. In contrast, a Soulk­
nife strikes and infiltrates with the mind, cutting 
through barriers both physical and psychic. These 
rogues discover psionic power within themselves 
and channel it to do their roguish work. They find 
easy employment as members of thieves' guilds, 
CHAPTER 1 I CHARACTER OPTIONS 63 
though they are often mistrusted by rogues who are 
leery of anyone using strange mind powers to con­
duct their business. Most governments would also 
be happy to employ a Soulknife as a spy.


Amid the trees of ancient forests on the Material
Plane and in the Feywild, some wood elves walk 
the path of the Soulknif e, serving as silent, lethal 
guardians of their woods. In the endless war among 
the gith, a githzerai is encouraged to become a


Soulknif e when stealth is required against the
githyanki foe. 
As a Soulknife, your psionic abilities might have 
haunted you since you were a child, only revealing 
their full potential as you experienced the stress of 
adventure. Or you might have sought out a reclusive 
order of psychic adepts and spent years learning 
how to manifest your power.


PSIONIC POWER
3rd-level Soulknife feature


You harbor a wellspring of psionic energy within
yourself. This· energy is represented by your Psionic 
Energy dice, which are each a d6. You have a num­
ber of these dice equal to twice your proficiency bo­
nus, and they fuel various psionic powers you have, 
which are detailed below. 
64 CHAPTER 1 I CHAR ACTER OPTIONS Some of your powers expend the Psionic Energy 
die they use, as specified in a power's description, 
and you can't use a power if it requires you to use a 
die when your dice are all expended. You regain all 
your expended Psionic Energy dice when you finish 
a long rest. In addition, as a bonus action, you can 
regain one expended Psionic Energy die, but you 
can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest. 
When you reach certain levels in this class, the 
size of your Psionic Energy dice increases: at 5th 
level (d8), 11th level (dlO), and 17th level (d12). 
The powers below use your Psionic Energy dice. 
Psi-Bols tered Knack. When your nonpsionic 
training fails you, your psionic power can help: if 
you fail an ability check using a skill or tool with 
which you have proficienc y, you can roll one Psionic 
Energy die and add the number rolled to the check, 
potentially turning failure into success. You expend 
the die only if the roll succeeds. 
Psychic Whispers. You can establish telepathic 
communication between yourself and others-per­
fect for quiet infiltration. As an action, choose one 
or more creatures you can see, up to a number of 
creatures equal to your proficiency bonus, and then 
roll one Psionic Energy die. For a number of hours 
equal to the number rolled, the chosen creatures 
can speak telepathically with you, and you can 
speak telepathically with them. To send or receive 
a message (no action required), you and the other 
creature must be within 1 mile of each other. A crea­
ture can't use this telepathy if it can't speak any lan­
guages, and a creature can end the telepathic con­
nection at any time (no action required). You and the 
creature don't need to speak a common language to 
understand each other.


The first time you use this power after each long
rest, you don't expend the Psionic Energy die. All 
other times you use the power, you expend the die.


PSYCHIC BLADES
3rd-level Soulknife feature 
You can manifest your psionic power as shimmer­
ing blades of psychic energy. Whenever you take 
the Attack action, you can man ifest a psychic blade 
from your free hand and make the attack with that 
blade. This magic blade is a simple melee weapon 
with the finesse and thrown properties. It has a nor­
. ma! range of 60 feet and no long range, and on a hit, 
it deals psychic damage equal to ld6 plus the ability 
modifier you used for the attack roll. The blade van­
ishes immediately after it hits or misses its target, 
and it leaves no mark on its target if it deals damage. 
After you attack with the blade, you can make 
a melee or ranged weapon attack with a second 
psychic blade as a bonus action on the same 
turn, provided your other hand is free to create 
it. The damage die of this bonus attack is ld4, in­
stead of ld6. 
SOUL BLADES · 
9th-level Soulknife feature


Your Psychic Blades are now an expression of your
psi-suffused soul, giving you these powers that use 
your Psionic Energy dice: 
Homing Stri kes. If you make an attack roll with 
your Psychic Blades and miss the target, you can 
roll one Psionic Energy die and add the number 
rolled to the attack roll. If this causes the attack to 
hit, you expend the Psionic Energy die. 
Psyc hic Teleportation. As a bonus action, you 
manifest one of your Psychic Blades, expend one 
Psionic Energy die and roll it, and throw the blade at 
an unoccupied space you can see, up to a number of 
feet away equal to 10 times the number rolled. You 
then teleport to that space, and the blade vanishes.


PSYCHIC VEIL
13th-level Soulknife feature


You can weave a veil of psychic static to mask
yourself. As an action, you can magically become 
invisible, along with anything you are wearing or 
carrying, for 1 hour or until you dismiss this effect 
(no action required). This invisibility ends early im­
mediately after you deal damage to a creature or you 
force a creature to make a saving throw. 
Once you use this feature, you can't do so again 
until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a 
Psionic Energy die to use this feature again.


REND MIND
17th-level Soulknife feature


You can sweep your Psychic Blades directly through
a creature's mind. When you use your Psychic 
Blades to deal Sneak Attack damage to a creature, 
you can force that target to make a Wisdom saving 
throw (DC equal to 8 +your proficien cy bonus + 
your Dexterity modifier). If the save fails, the target 
is stunned for 1 minute. The stunned target can re­
peat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, 
ending the effect on itself on a success. 
Once you use this feature, you can't do so again 
until you finish a long rest, unless you expend three 
Psionic Energy dice to use it again. jl


SORCERER
The sorcerer class receives new features and sub­
classes in this section.

An alien influence has wrapped its tendrils around
your mind, giving you psionic power. You can now 
touch other minds with that power and alter the 
world around you by using it to control the magical 
energy of the multiverse. Will this power shine from 
you as a hopeful beacon to others? Or will you be a 
source of terror to those who feel the stab of your 
mind and witness the strange manifestations of 
your might?


A SORCERER USES
TRANSMUTED SPELL. 
As an Aberrant Mind sorcerer, you decide how you 
acquired your powers. Were you born with them?


Or did an event later in life leave you shining with
psionic awareness? Consult the Aberrant Origins 
table for a possible origin of your power.


ABERRANT ORIGINS
d6 Origin 
You were exposed to the Far Realm's warping in­
fluence. You are convinced that a tentacle is now 
growing on you, but no one else can see it. 
2 A psychic wind from the Astral Plane carried 
psionic energy to you. When you use your powers, 
faint motes of light sparkle around you. 
3 You once suffered the dominating powers of an 
aboleth, leaving a psychic splinter in your mind. 
4 You were implanted with a mind flayer tadpole, but 
the ceremorphosis never completed. And now its 
psionic power is yours. When you use it, your flesh 
shines with a strange mucus. 
5 As a child, you had an imaginary friend that looked 
like a flu mph or a strange platypus-like creature. 
One day, it gifted you with psionic powers, which 
have ended up being not so imaginary. 
6 Your nightmares whisper the truth to you: your 
psionic powers are not your own. You draw them 
from your parasitic twin! 
Ps10N1c SPELLS 
1st-level Aberrant Mind feature


You learn additional spells when you reach certain
levels in this class, as shown on the Psionic Spells 
table. Each of these spells counts as a sorcerer spell

sorcerer spells you know. 
Whenever you gain a sorcerer level, you can re­
place one spell you gained from this feature with 
another spell of the same level. The new spell must 
be a divination or an enchantment spell from the 
sorcerer , warlock, or wizard spell list.

derstand each other, you each must speak mentally

The cosmic force of order has suffused you with
magic. That power arises from Mechanus or a 
realm like it-a plane of existence shaped enti rely by 
clockwork efficiency. You, or someone from your lin­
eage, might have become entangled in the machina­
tions of the modrons, the orderly beings who inhabit 
Mechanus. Perhaps your ancestor even took part in 
the Great Modron March. Whatever its origin within 
you, the power of order can seem strange to others, 
but for you, it is part of a vast and glorious system.


CLOCKWORK MAGIC
1st-level Clockwork Soul feature


You learn additional spells when you reach certain
levels in this class, as shown on the Clockwork 
Spells table. Each of these spells counts as a sor­
cerer spell for you, but it doesn't count against the 
number of sorcerer spells you know. 
Whenever you gain a sorcerer level, you can re­
place one spell you gained from this feature with 
another spell of the same level. The new spell must 
be an abjuration or a transmutation spell from the 
sorcerer , warlock, or wizard spell list.

any of your sorcerer spells.


MANIFESTATIONS OF ORDER

Spectral cogwheels hover behind you. 
2 The hands of a clock spin in your eyes. 
3 Your skin glows with a brassy sheen. 
4 Floating equations and geometric objects overlay 
your body. 
5 Your spellcasting focus temporarily takes the form 
of a Tiny clockwork mechanism. 
6 The ticking of gears or ringing of a clock can be 
heard by you and those affected by your magic.


RESTORE BALANCE
1st-level Clockwork Soul feature 
Your connection to the plane of absolute order al­
lows you to equalize chaotic moments. When a crea­
ture you can see within 60 feet of you is about to roll 
a d20 with advantag e or disadvantage, you can use 
your reaction to prevent the roll from being affected 
by advantag e and disadvantage.


You can use this feature a number of times equal
to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all ex­
pended uses when you finish a long rest.


BASTION OF LAW
6th-level Clockwork Soul feature


You can tap into the grand equation of existence to
imbue a creature with a shimmering shield of order. 
As an action, you can expend 1 to 5 sorcery points 
to create a magical ward around yourself or another 
creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The ward 
lasts until you finish a long rest or until you use this 
feature again. 
The ward is represented by a number of d8s equal 
to the number of sorcery points spent to create it. 
When the warded creature takes damage, it can ex­
pend a number of those dice, roll them, and reduce 
the damage taken by the total rolled on those dice.


TRANCE OF ORDER
14th-level Clockwork Soul feature


You gain the ability to align your consciousness to
the endless calculations of Mechanus. As a bonus 
action, you can enter this state for 1 minute. For the 
duration, attack rolls against you can't benefit from 
advantage, and whenever you make an attack roll, 
an ability check, or a saving throw, you can treat a 
roll of 9 or lower on the d20 as a 10. 
Once you.use .this bonus action, you can't use it
again until you finish a long rest, unless you spend 5 
sorcery points to use it again. liuMAN CcocKWORK Souc


CLOCKWORK CAVALCADE
18th-level Clockwork Soul feature


You summon spirits of order to expunge disorder
around you. As an action, you summon the spirits in 
a 30-foot cube originating from you. The spirits look 
like modrons or other constructs of your choice. 
The spirits are intangible and invulnerable, and they 
create the following effects within the cube before 
vanishing: 
• The spirits restore up to 100 hit points, divided 
as you choose among any number of creatures of 
your choice in the cube. 
• Any damaged objects entirely in the cube are re­
paired instantly. 
• Every spell of 6th level or lower ends on creatures 
and objects of your choice in the cube. 
Once you use this action, you can't use it again un­
til you finish a long rest, unless you spend 7 sorcery 
points to use it again.

TASHA
You have plunged into a pact with the deeps. An 
entity of the ocean, the Elemental Plane of Water, 
or another otherworldly sea now allows you to draw 
on its thalassic power. Is it merely using you to learn 
about terrestrial realms, or does it want you to open 
cosmic floodgates and drown the world? 
72 CHAP TER 1 I CHA RACTER OPTIONS Perhaps you were born into a generational cult 
that venerates the Fathomless and its spawn. Or 
you might have been shipwrecked and on the brink 
of drowning when your patron's grasp offered you 
a chance at life. Whatever the reason for your pact, 
the sea and its unknown depths call to you.


Entities of the deep that might empower a warlock
include krakens, ancient water elementals, godlike 
hallucinations dreamed into being by kuo-toa, mer­
folk demigods, and sea hag covens.


EXPANDED SPELL LIST

list for you.

TENTACLE OF THE DEEPS
1st-level Fathomless feature


You can magically summon a spectral tentacle that
strikes at your foes. As a bonus action, you create a 
10-foot-long tentacle at a point you can see within 
60 feet of you. The tentacle lasts for 1 minute or un­
til you use this feature to create another tentacle. 
When you create the tentacle, you can make a me­
lee spell attack against one creature within 10 feet 
of it. On a hit, the target takes ld8 cold damage, and 
its speed is reduced by 10 feet until the. start of your 
next turn. When you reach 10th level in this class, 
the damage increases to 2d8. 
As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the 
tentacle up to 30 feet and repeat the attack.


You can summon the tentacle a number of times
equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all 
expended uses when you finish a long rest.


GIFT OF THE SEA
1st-level Fathomless feature 
You gain a swimming speed of 40 feet, and you can 
breathe underwater.


OCEANIC SOUL
6th-level Fathomless feature 
You are now even more at home in the depths. You 
gain resistance to cold damage. In addition, when 
you are fully sub.merged, any creature that is also
fully submerged can understand your speech, and 
you can understand theirs.


GUARDIAN COIL
6th-level Fathomless feature


Your Tentacle of the Deeps can defend you and
others, interposing itself between them and harm.


When you or a creature you can see takes damage
while within 10 feet of the tentacle, you can use your 
reaction to choose one of those creatures and re­
duce the damage to that creature by ld8. When you 
reach 10th level in this class, the damage reduced 
by the tentacle increases to 2d8.


GRASPING TENTACLES
10th-level Fathomless feature 
You learn the spell Evard's black tentacles. It counts 
as a warlock spell for you, but it doesn't count 
against the number of spells you know. You can also 
cast it once without a spell slot, and you regain the 
ability to do so when you finish a long rest. 
Whenever you cast this spell, your patron's magic 
bolsters you, granting you a number of temporary 
hit points equal to your warlock level. Moreover, 
damage can't break your concentration on this spell.


FATHOMLESS PLUNGE
14th-level Fathomless feature


You can magically open temporary conduits to
watery destinations. As an action, you can teleport 
yourself and up to five other willing creatures that 
you can see within 30 feet of you. Amid a whirl of 
tentacles, you all vanish and then reappear up to 
1 mile away in a body of water you've seen (pond 
size or larger) or within 30 feet of it, each of you 
appearing in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of 
the others. 
Once you use this feature, you can't use it again 
until you finish a short or long rest.

You have made a pact with one of the rarest kinds 
of genie, a noble genie. Such entities rule vast fiefs 
on the Elemental Planes and have great influence 
over lesser genies and elemental creatures. Noble 
genies are varied in their motivations, but most are 
arrogant and wield power that rivals that of lesser 
deities. They delight in turn,ing the table on mortals, 
who often bind genies into servitude, and readily en­
ter into pacts that expand their reach. 
You choose your patron's kind or determine it ran­

While you are touching the vessel, you can use it 
in the following ways: 
Bottled Respite. As an action, you can magically 
vanish and enter your vessel, which remains 
in the space you left. The interior of the vessel 
is an extradimensional space in the shape of a 
20-foot-radius cylinder, 20 feet high, and resem­
bles your vessel. The interior is appointed with 
cushions and low tables and is a comfortable 
temperature. While inside, you can hear the area 
around your vessel as if you were in its space. You 
74 CHAPTER 1 I CHARA CTER OPTIONS can remain inside the vessel up to a number of 
hours equal to twice your proficien cy bonus. You 
exit the vessel early if you use a bonus action to 
leave, if you die, or if the vessel is destroyed. When 
you exit the vessel, you appear in the unoccupied 
space closest to it. Any objects left in the vessel 
remain there until carried out, and if the vessel is 
destroyed, every object stored there harmlessly 
appears in the unoccupied spaces closest to the 
vessel's former space. Once you enter the vessel, 
you can't enter again until you finish a long rest. 
Genie's Wrath. Once during each of your turns 
when you hit with an attack roll, you can deal ex­
tra damage to the target equal to your proficiency 
bonus. The type of this damage is determined by 
your patron: bludgeoning (dao), thunder (djinni), 
. fire (efreeti), or cold (marid). 
The vessel's AC equals your spell save DC. Its 
hit points equal your warlock level plus your profi­
ciency bonus, and it is immune to poison and psy­
chic damage. 
If the vessel is destroyed or you lose it, you can 
perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement 
from your patron. This ceremony can be performed 
during a short or long rest, and the previous vessel 
is destroyed if it still exists. The vessel vanishes in a 
flare of elemental power when you die.


ELEMENTAL GIFT

You begin to take on characteristics of your patron's
kind. You now have resistance to a damage type de­
termined by your patron's kind: bludgeoning (dao), 
thunder (djinni), fire (efreeti), or cold (marid). 
In addition, as a bonus action, you can give 
yourself a flying speed of 30 feet that lasts for 10 
minutes, during which you can hover. You can use 
this bonus action a number of times equal to your 
proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses 
when you finish a long rest.

10th-level Genie feature 
When you enter your Genie's Vessel via the Bot­
tled Respite feature, you can now choose up to five 
willing creatures that you can see within 30 feet of 
you, and the chosen creatures are drawn into the 
vessel with you. 
As a bonus action, you can eject any number of 
creatures from the vessel, and everyone is ejected if 
you leave or die or if the vessel is destroyed. 
In addition, anyone (including you) who remains 
within the vessel for at least 10 minutes gains the 
benefit of finishing a short rest, and anyone can add 
your proficiency bonus to the number of hit points 
they regain if they spend any Hit Dice as part of a 
short rest there.


LIMITED WISH
14th-level Genie feature 
You entreat your patron to grant you a small wish. 
As an action, you can speak your desire to your Ge­
nie's Vessel, requesting the effect of one spell that is 
6th level or lower and has a casting time of 1 action. 
The spell can be from any class's spell list, and you 
don't need to meet the requirements in that spell, 
including costly components; the spell simply takes 
effect as part of this action. 
Once you use this feature, you can't use it again 
until you finish ld4 long rests. ' I '


WIZARD JI
J 
The wizard class receives new features and sub­
classes in this section.


OPTIONAL CLASS FEA TURES
You gain class features in the Player's Handbook 
when you reach certain levels in your class. This 
section offers additional features that you can gain 
as a wizard. Unlike the features in the Player's 
Handbook, you don't gain the features here automat­
ically. Consulting with your DM, you decide whether 
to gain a feature in this section if you meet the level 
requirement noted in the feature's description.


These features can be selected separately from one
another; you can use some, all, or none of them.


ADDIT IONAL WIZARD SPELLS
1st-level wizard feature


The spells in the following list expand the wizard
spell list in the Player's Handbook. The list is or­
ganized by spell level, not character level. A spell's 
school of magic is noted, and if a spell can be cast as 
a ritual, the ritual tag appears after the spell's name. 
Each spell is in the Player's Handbook, unless it has 
an asterisk (a spell in chapter 3). Xanathar's Guide 
to Everything also offers more spells.

CANTRIP FOR MULAS
3rd-level wizard feature


You have scribed a set of arcane formulas in your
spellbook that you can use to formulate a cantrip 
in your mind. Whenever you finish a long rest and 
consult those formulas in your spellbook, you can 
replace one wizard cantrip you know with another 
cantrip from the wizard spell list.


ARCANE TRA DITIONS
At 2nd level, a wizard gains the Arcane Tradition 
feature, which offers you the choice of a subclass.


The following options are available to you when
making that choice: Bladesinging and the Order 
of Scribes.


BLADE SINGING

TASHA·


Bladesingers master a tradition of wizardry that
incorporates swordplay and dance. Originall y cre­
ated by elves, this tradition has been adopted by 
non-elf practitioners, who honor and expand on the 
elven ways. 
In combat, a bladesinger uses a series of intricate, 
elegant maneuvers that fend off harm and allow 
the bladesinger to channel magic into devastating attacks and a cunning defense. Many who have 
observed a bladesinger at work remember the 
display as one of the more beautif ul experiences 
in their life, a glorious dance accompanied by a 
singing blade.


TRAINING IN WAR AND SONG
2nd-level Bladesinging feature 
You gain proficiency with light armor, and you gain 
proficiency with one type of one-handed melee 
weapon of your choice.


You also gain proficiency in the Performance skill
if you don't already have it.


BLADE SONG
2nd-level Bladesinging feature


You can invoke an elven magic called the
Bladesong, provided that you aren't wearing me­
dium or heavy armor or using a shield. It graces you 
with supernatural speed, agility, and focus. 
You can use a bonus action to start the Bladesong, 
which lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are in­
capacitat ed, if you don medium or heavy armor or 
a shield, or if you use two hands to make an attack 
with a weapon. You can also dismiss the Bladesong 
at any time (no action required). 
While your Bladesong is active, you gain the fol­
lowing benefits: 
A DROW /\NO /\ li lGH 
ELF BL/\DESINGER 
• You gain a bonus to your AC equal to your Intelli­
gence modifier (minimum of +1). 
• Your walking speed increases by 10 feet. 
• You have advantage on Dexterity (Acrobat­
ics) checks. 
• You gain a bonus to any Constitution saving throw 
you make to maintain your concentration on a 
spell. The bonus equals your Intelligence modifier 
(minimum of+ 1).


You can use this feature a number of times equal
to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all ex­
pended uses of it when you finish a long rest.


EXTRA ATTACK
6th-level Bladesinging feature 
You can attack twice, instead of once, whenever 
you take the Attack action on your turn. Moreover, 
you can cast one of your cantrips in place of one of 
those attacks.


SONG OF DEFENSE
10th-level Bladesinging feature


You can direct your magic to absorb damage while
your Bladesong is active. When you take damage, 
you can use your reaction to expend one spell slot 
and reduce that damage to you by an amount equal 
to five times the spell slot's level.


SONG OF VICTORY
14th-level Bladesinging feature 
You can add your Intelligence modifier (minimum 
of+ 1) to the damage of your melee weapon attacks 
while your Bladesong is active.


ORDER OF SCRIBES
MA�ic is �reAt Al-\IA All, b1.1t hAve �01.1 smelleiA A book? 
TASl/A 
Magic of the book-that's what many folk call wiz­
ardry. The name is apt, given how much time wiz­
ards spend poring over tomes and penning theories 
about the nature of magic. It's rare to see wizards 
traveling without books and scrolls sprouting from 
their bags, and a wizard would go to great lengths to 
plumb an archive of ancient knowledge. 
Among wizards, the Order of Scribes is the most 
bookish. It takes many forms in different worlds, 
but its primary mission is the same everywhere: 
recording magical discoveries so that wizardry can 
flourish. And while all wizards value spellbooks, a 
wizard in the Order of Scribes magically awakens 
their book, turning it into a trusted companion. All 
wizards study books, but a wizardly scribe talks 
to theirs! liUM/\N Wll. /\RO,


ORDER OF SCRIBES
WIZARDLY QUILL 
2nd-level Order of Scribes feature 
As a bonus action, you can magically create a Tiny 
quill in your free hand. The magic quill has the fol­
lowing properties: 
• The quill doesn't require ink. When you write with 
it, it produces ink in a color of your choice on the 
writing surface. 
• The time you must spend to copy a spell into your 
spellbook equals 2 minutes per spell level if you 
use the quill for the transcription. 
• You can erase anything you write with the quill if 
you wave the feather over the text as a bonus ac­
tion, provided the text is within 5 feet of you.


This quill disappears if you create another one or
if you die.


AWAKENED SPELLBOOK
2nd-level Order of Scribes feature 
Using specially prepared inks and ancient incan­
tations passed down by your wizardly order, you 
have awakened an arcane sentience within your 
spell book. 
While you are holding the book, it grants you the 
following benefits: 
CHAP TER l I CHAR ACTER OPTIONS 77 
• You can use the book as a spellcasting focus for 
your wizard spells. 
• When you cast a wizard spell with a spell slot, 
you can temporarily replace its damage type with 
a type that appears in another spell in your spell­
book, which magically alters the spell's formula 
for this casting only. The latter spell must be of the 
same level as the spell slot you expend. 
• When you cast a wizard spell as a ritual, you can 
use the spell's normal casting time, rather than 
adding 10 minutes to it. Once you use this benefit, 
you can't do so again until you finish a long rest. 
If necessar y, you can replace the book over the 
course of a short rest by using your Wizardly Quill 
to write arcane sigils in a blank book or a magic 
spell book to which you're attuned. At the end of the 
rest, your spellbook's consciousness is summoned 
into the new book, which the consciousness trans­
forms into your spellbook, along with all its spells. 
If the previous book still existed somewhere, all the 
spells vanish from its pages.


MANIFEST MIND
6th-level Order of Scribes feature


You can conjure forth the mind of your Awakened
Spellbook. As a bonus action while the book is on 
your person, you can cause the mind to manifest as 
a Tiny spectral object, hovering in an unoccupied 
space of your choice within 60 feet of you. The spec­
tral mind is intangible and doesn't occupy its space, 
and it sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius. It looks 
like a ghostly tome, a cascade of text, or a scholar 
from the past (your choice). 
While manifested, the spectral mind can hear and 
see, and it has darkvision with a range of 60 feet.


The mind can telepathically share with you what it
sees and hears (no action required). 
Whenever you cast a wizard spell on your turn, 
you can cast it as if you were in the spectral mind's 
space, instead of your own, using its senses. You 
can do so a number of times per day equal to your 
proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses 
when you finish a long rest. 
As a bonus action, you can cause the spectral 
mind to hover up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space 
that you or it can see. It can pass through creatures 
but not objects.


The spectral mind stops manifesting if it is ever
more than 300 feet away from you, if someone casts 
dispel magic on it, if the Awakened Spellbook is 
destroyed, if you die, or if you dismiss the spectral 
mind as a bonus action. 
Once you conjure the mind, you can't do so again 
until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a 
spell slot of any level to conjure it again. 
CHAPTER 1 I CHA RACTER OPTIONS MASTER SCRIVENER 
10th-level Order of Scribes feature 
Whenever you finish a long rest, you can create one 
magic scroll by touching your Wizardly Quill to a 
blank piece of paper or parchment and causing one 
spell from your Awakened Spellbook to be copied 
onto the scroll. The spellbook must be within 5 feet 
of you when you make the scroll. 
The chosen spell must be of 1st or 2nd level and 
must have a casting time of 1 action. Once in the 
scroll, the spell's power is enhanced, counting as 
one level higher than normal. You can cast the spell 
from the scroll by reading it as an action. The scroll 
is unintelligible to anyone else, and the spell van­
ishes from the scroll when you cast it or when you 
finish your next long rest. 
You are also adept at crafting spell scrolls, which 
are described in the treasure chapter of the Dun­
geon Master's Guide. The gold and time you must 
spend to make such a scroll are halved if you use 
your Wizardly Quill.


ONE WITH THE WORD
14th-level Order of Scribes feature


Your connection to your Awakened Spellbook has
become so profound that your soul has become 
entwined with it. While the book is on your person, 
you have advantage on all Intelligence (Arcana) 
checks, as the spellbook helps you remember 
magical lore. 
Moreover, if you take damage while your spell­
book's mind is manifested, you can prevent all of 
that damage to you by using your reaction to dis­
miss the spectral mind, using its magic to save your­
self. Then roll 3d6. The spellbook temporarily loses 
spells of your choice that have a combined spell 
level equal to that roll or higher. For example, if the 
rail's total is 9, spells vanish from the book that have 
a combined level of at least 9, which could mean one 
9th-level spell, three 3rd-level spells, or some other 
combination. If there aren't enough spells in the 
book to cover this cost, you drop to 0 hit points. 
Until you finish ld6 long rests, you are incapable 
of casting the lost spells, even if you find them on a 
scroll or in another spellbook. After you finish the 
required number of rests, the spells reappear in the 
spellbook. 
Once you use this reaction, you can't do so again 
until you finish a long rest.

CHAPTER 2


GRO UP PATRO NS
G-E ACH ADVENTUR ING GROUP IS BOUND 
together by the quests it embarks on and 
by the dangers its members face together.


This chapter offers another way to bind
your party together: a group patron. These patrons 
provide a strong binding element: an individual or 
an organization that unites a party as a team in ser­
vice to a greater purpose. A group patron can help 
set the tone of your party's entire campaign. For 
example, a group whose patron is an academic insti­
tution is likely to have a very different story from a 
group that serves a military. A patron can influence 
characters' relationships, their backstories, and the 
types of dangers they face. 
During character creation, every pla yer has the 
opportunity to weave connections between their 
character and the other members of their party. 
Rather than (or in addition to) creating a web of es­
tablished relationships, players can work with the 
DM to choose a group patron. And if you're inter­
ested in being your own patron, see the "Being Your 
Own Patron" section at the end of the chapter.


Ho w PATRONS WO RK
The following sections present several group patron 
options. The description of each patron provides 
an overview of the types of organizations the group 
patron represents, perks of membership, and quests 
the patron encourages adventurers to undertake. 
With the input of your DM, you can customize 
these patrons to reflect specific establishments in 
your campaign world or to serve as a launchpad 
tailored for organizations of your design. For ex­
ample, the guild group patron could represent the 
Harpers or the Zhentarim of the Forgotten Realms, 
the Clifftop Adventurers' Guild in Eberron, or a 
homebrew league of caravan guards. Or perhaps a 
criminal syndicate, military force, or other category 
of patron better fits the party's goals. Choose and 
customize the group patron that works best for 
your party and the types of adventures you want 
to explore.


GROU P Assis TANCE
Having a group patron gives an adventuring group 
a common purpose, which inspires better coordina­
tion in the form of guidance and encouragement. As 
a result of this unity, each member of the party can 
grant advantage to an ability check, an attack roll, or a saving throw of another member of the party. To 
grant advantage in this way, a character and the cho­
sen target must be able to see or hear each other, 
and neither can be incapacitated. Once a party 
member grants this advantage, that individual can't 
do so again until they finish a long rest.


PERKS
A group patron offers your party a number of perks 
for your service. These range from standard busi­
ness arrangements, such as a steady wage and ac­
cess to staff facilities, to extraordinary boons, such 
as audiences with powerful figures or exceptions 
from certain laws. Specific perks are presented in 
the description of each group patron.


The DM should not feel limited to providing only
the perks noted in each group patron's description.


Patrons give a party access to solutions and support
they wouldn't have otherwise, and a patron can use 
their varied resources to guide their agents or pre­
pare them for greater adventures.


ASS IGN MENTS
Your group's patron occasionally offers you an as­
signment, a mission that provides a springboard for 
adventure. Of course, it's up to you how you respond 
to your patron's demands, and interesting stories 
can result if you decide to refuse an assignment.


A more hands-off patron can still significantly
motivate your group. Maybe you seek adventures 
based on what pleases your patron, possibly earning 
status and rewards within your organization. An 
academy, for example, might not organize particular 
missions, so you hunt down ancient artifacts know­
ing that your patron will reward you for bringing 
them back. You have the freedom to chart your own 
destiny, while letting the patron shape the nature of 
your group and the adventures you undertake.


EXAM PLE PATRONS
Here are some of the most likely patrons for an ad­
venturing group. Presented in alphabetical order, 
these patrons can serve as inspiration for you to cre­
ate patrons of your own:


Academy
Ancient Being


Aristocrat
Criminal Syndicate Guild


Military Force
Religious Order

The world's mysteries are innumerable, but you pur­
sue them with vigor. As operatives for an academ y, 
you seek to unravel the secrets of existence and the 
deeper riddles beyond. 
In your work, you brush shoulders with the wisest 
in the land, travel to places spoken of in myth, and 
discover truths beyond imagining. Denying igno­
rance, you pursue wondrous sights and endlessly 
unearth new facts. Undiscovered creatures, the cov­
etous dead, and jealous rivals impede your work, but 
in the pursuit of knowledge, no risk is too great.


TYPES OF ACADEMIES
Any assemblage of scholars and truth-seekers can 
function as an academy. Generall y, an academ y 
unites a network of learned individuals, allowing 
them to share their knowledge, further their re­
search, and support common goals. Passing on wis­
dom to the next generation is part of an academy's 
mandate, but members find opportunities to under­
take far-flung research expeditions-only so much can be learned in libraries, after all. An academy's 
focus can be broad or singular , artistic or scientific, 
mundane or magical. For every topic with unex­
plored possibilities, an academy seeks to plumb its 
depths or elevate its study. 
Roll or pick from the Academy Type table to deter­
mine the institution with which you're aligned.


ACADEMY TYPE
d6 Academy Types 
Boarding School. Students and faculty enjoy a famil­
ial relationship on a self-contained campus. 
2 Arcane Enclave. Drawn together by cutting-edge 
magical scholarsh ip, the enclave's residents are 
hungry for secrets, reagents, and subjects. 
3 Secret Monastery. Ageless secrets remain the focus 
of contemplation and rigorous training at this site. 
4 Elite Institute. This cutthroat college of science or 
the arts accepts only the creme de la creme of soci­
ety and talent. 
5 Vault of Secrets. This conspiracy strives to keep or 
eradicate all knowledge of a specific truth. 
6 Museum of Dreams. Magical communication 
or shared dreamscapes connect a network of 
wide-ranging specialists.


ACADEMY PERKS
With an academy as your group's patron, you gain 
the following perks. 
Comp ensat ion. The academy pays for the work 
you do on its behalf. The nature of your employment 
influences your compensation. On average, the 
academy pays each member of your group 1 gp per 
day, or enough to sustain a modest lifestyle. Alterna­
tively, you receive a bounty (at least 250 gp) for each 
artifact or relevant discovery you bring back from 
your adventures and donate to the academy. 
Document ation. Each member of your group has 
identification denoting your affiliation with the acad­
emy. This association carries clout in scholarly or 
artistic circles. The academy also secures documen­
tation, letters of introduction, and traveling papers 
if your work requires them. Such documents grant 
you special status, such as access to forbidden re­
gions or neutral standing in embattled areas. Such 
identification isn't always a boon, though. In a land 
frequently plundered by foreigners, your documents 
could mark you as nothing more than aggrandized 
looters to some. 
Research. Research is part of your group's job, 
but your patron also has abundant resources to 
facilitate such efforts. You can call in a favor to 
delegate the work of researching lore (a downtime 
activity described in the Player's Handbook and 
Xanathar's Guide to Everything) to a colleague, 
contact, librarian, or research assistant. You're re­
sponsible for covering expenses incurred as part of 
this research, and the DM determines its success 
or failure. 
Resources. Academies host libraries, museums, 
record repositories, and training facilities, and you 
can use them to further your work. You can call in a 
favor from faculty members to access resources not 
available to the public-dang erous relics or magic 
items, spellbooks, gear, and the like. Additional ly, 
you can consult with the faculty of your academy as 
the experts in various fields. 
Training. Because you're associated with the 
academy, you receive a discount on any education 
you wish to pursue. When you undergo training as 
a downtime activity (as described in the Player's 
Handbook or Xanathar's Guide to Everything), you 
pay half the normal cost, assuming the academy 
teaches that subject. Training in languages, musical 
instruments, and other tools is also available, at 
the DM's discretion. In addition, you can gain pro­
ficiency in the Arcana, History, Nature, or Religion 
skills by this method, as if you were learning a lan­
guage. A character can learn only one of these skills 
in this way. ACADEMY CONTACT


How much autonomy you have in choosing your
missions and how often you're expected to perform 
on the academy's behalf depends largely on your 
place in the institution's hierarchy. As students, new 
professors, or support staff, you aid the work of a 
senior professor or entire department. If you are fur­
ther along in your career, you have your own goals 
and assistants, but you still take on assignments to 
further the goals of esteemed experts, deans, or the 
academy as a whole. In any of these cases, a specific 
contact manages your relationship to the academy. 
Roll or pick from the Academy Contact table to de­
termine who manages the relationship between you 
and the academy.


ACADEMY CONTACT
d6 Contact 
Harried Functionary. A disinterested secretary con­
veys written corresponde nce to you from an excep­
tionally busy or aloof senior faculty member . 
2 Celebrated Instructor. Despite their throngs of am­
bitious assistants, a celebrity researcher considers 
you their star pupil. 
3 Wizened Fixture. A fantastically old, believed-to-be­
deceased librarian gives you assignm ents from the 
circulation desk they never leave. 
4 Infatuated Tourist. A flirtatious visiting scholar per­
ceives your every report and donated discovery as a 
personal gift. 
S Spectral Fragment. A haunted piece of the acade­
my's collection compels you to complete its secret 
research. 
6 Distant Observer. A mysterious sponsor encourages 
your research from afar to avoid alerting nefarious 
forces embedded within the academy's bureaucracy.


ACADEMY FACTOTUMS
If you have an academy as your patron, you are 
likely engaged in a scholarly pursuit or support 
someone who is. Consider being a promising stu­
dent or a new member of the faculty. While you have 
a modest course load that you handle behind the 
scenes (or using any of a variety of downtime activi­
ties), your primary interests involve aiding your con­
tact in their research. Alternatively, you might work 
to further the academy's efforts in another way, per­
haps related to security or funding.

ACADEMY QUESTS
The focus of your study and the academy's research 
defines the missions you undertake. Academics 
struggle to keep one step ahead of their scholarly 
rivals, making many of them suspicious of-even 
hostile toward-other intellectuals. Beyond rivals 
within their own profession, academics face chal­
lenges from their subjects (whether members of 
lost civilizations or magical beings) or suspicious 
anti-intellectuals. Not everyone wants to be the sub­
ject of scholarly scrutiny or thinks that solving the 
world's mysteries is important or desirable.


The Academy Quests table presents a few of the
sort of endeavors your work or studies lead you to 
undertake.


ACADEMY QUES TS
d6 Quest 
Aberrant Zoology. You undertake expeditions to 
document, capture, and explain beings antithetical 
to the natural order. 
2 Arcanodynamics. You investigate the ways magic 
underpins existence, exploring its flows and seeking 
ways to harness its nexuses. 
3 Forbidden History. You reveal the lost truths of the 
world's darkest ages, pursuing the history of pur­
posefully hidden or taboo eras. 
4 Cryptogeography. You search for proof of a hidden 
land or that the world isn't structured as commonly 
assumed. 
S Restorative Antiquarianism. You track clues leading
to plundered artifacts and then restore them to 
their rightful owners. 
6 Evolutionary Divinity. You dare to explore what no 
mortal was meant to know: the origi ns of divinity.

TASHA
Your group is bound to the designs of an ancient be­
ing of tremendous power and influence. You might 
serve as the creature's eyes and ears in the world, 
carrying information back to it. Or perhaps you 
work as its direct agents, enacting its will. Whether 
you chose this arrangement or were tricked into 
it, you can count on the strange resources of your 
benefactor as long as you serve its purpose.


TYPES OF ANCIENT BEINGS
From brooding dragons to unfathomable voices 
whispering from the dark, ancient beings guide 
and empower mortals for inscrutable reasons. The 
relationship your group has to its patron might be 
a clearly defined exchange, or it could be uncertain 
or forceful. Whatever the nature of the being, as 
long as your group fulfills its role, the being of-
fers rewards. 
Roll or pick from the Ancient Being table to deter­
mine the being your group serves.


ANCIENT BEING
d6 Ancient Being 
Elder Dragon. An ancient dragon seeks knowledge 
or power. It wishes to gather greater wealth for its 
hoard, its ambitions expanding in its advancing 
years. 
2 Lich. An undead spellcaster of immense power em­
ploys your group. Its interests are strangely diverse 
and seeming ly benign. Perhaps it's not as evil as 
conventi onal adventuring wisdom suggests? 
3 Bound Fiend. This fiend is bound to a location, 
either in its true form or as a possessing spirit.


Whether trapped in an unbreakable circle of binding
sigils or sealed as a spirit within a gigantic statue, 
the fiend's influence drives your group. 
4 Guardian Celestial. An angel or another powerful 
celestial takes an interest in a specific region of the 
Material Plane. It cultivates a network of mortal in­
formants and agents to serve its agenda. 
d6 Ancient Being 
5 The Endless. This person has lived many lifetimes 
because they can't die-at least not permanen tly. 
No matter the cause of their demise, they return. To 
all appearances, they are alive and mortal, but they 
control the amassed resources of an immortal. 
6 Primal Manifestation. Its existence defies mor tal 
understanding; the being simply is. It could be a pri­
. mordial force of nature awakened to self-awareness 
that now inhabits the landscape or an alien intellect 
that whispers through proxies, omens, and idols.


ANCIENT BEING PERKS
With the ancient being as your group's patron, you 
gain the following perks. 
Equi pment. Your patron's network has access 
to certain magic items. You can purchase common 
magic items from your patron contact. The DM de­
termines the available stock or can call for a group 
Intelligence (Investigation) check to ascertain if the 
ancient being's network can successfully locate a 
desired item. The DC for this check is 10 in a city, 
15 in a town, and 20 in a village. If the check fails, 
ld8 days must pass before the same item can be 
searched for again in that community.


The DM sets the price of a common magic item
or determines it randomly: 2d4 x 10 gp, or half 
as much for a consumable item such as a potion 
or scroll. 
Research. Relying on an ancient being's network 
of contacts, the being's vast collection of lore, or per­
haps the being's direct teaching helps you unearth 
hidden secrets. If you can contact your patron or 
their agents, your group makes ability checks made 
to research lore related to your patron's interests 
and influence with advantage. 
Sanctuar y. Your patron's agents have safe houses 
or other secure gatherings spread across a wide re­
gion. Your group knows how to locate these friendly 
enclaves and can maintain a modest lifestyle in one 
for no cost. In return, you must defend the sanctu­
ary or protect the secret of its existence. 
Stra nge Gifts. Your patron grants your group a 
small measure of esoteric power. At 5th level, and 
again at 13th, you gain one supernatural gift as de­
scribed in the treasure chapter of the Dungeon Mas­
ter's Guide. The DM determines which supernatural 
gifts are available. A1.A LIN, THE LICH,

gamut from prosaic to otherworld ly. Roll or pick 
from the Ancient Being Contact table to determine 
who or what conveys your patron's will.


ANCIENT BEING CONTACT
d6 Contact 
Employer. An established member of local society 
acts as the interface between you and the patron 
and provides the cover of legitimate employment. 
They could be a bartender, shopkeeper, local offi­
cial, or noble. 
2 Back-Room Dealers. An exclusive area in an other­
wise-ordinary establishment requires a password or 
token to gain entry. There you meet and communi­
cate with shadowy agents of your patron. 
CHAP TER 2 I GROUP PATRONS 87 
d6 Contact 
3 Magical Message Drop. Magically recorded mes­
sages from your contact or your patron appear in 
odd places. You know to check a predetermined 
location, such as a crack in an ancient monolith or a 
specific grave, for instructions. 
4 Visions. Your patron doesn't use intermediaries, in­
stead speaking to you in dreams, omens, or visions. 
The being appears in your mind as you sleep, taking 
control of your dreams to deliver instructions that 
become difficult to ignore. 
5 Ephemeral Echo. Your contact never physicall y re­
veals itself to you. Perhaps it is the ghost of a dead 
person, an entity that appears outside the flow of 
time, or a projected illusion of a being that never 
leaves your patron's hidden sanctum. 
6 The Mouthpiece. The ancient being's voice whispers 
through the lips of an ordinary person. You patron 
might posses the body of a stranger or a party 
member to converse with you.


ANCIENT BEING OPERATIVES
Consider the overarching goals of your group's an­
cient being patron when determining who they re­
cruit as agents. In what arenas does that being likely 
hold sway? A powerful lich recruits other ambitious 
spellcasters, as well as skilled warriors to serve as 
bodyguards. A dragon values socially adept agents 
and those who influence society's decision-makers.


Consider how your capabilities and interests align
directly with those of the ancient being, or how you 
unwittingly fell into the patron's service.


The Ancient Being Operative Roles table suggests
a variety of parts you can play within an ancient 
being's schemes and the backgrounds frequently 
associated with each role.

Though their work remains mysterious, ancient be­
ings send their agents to exact their will in myriad 
ways. Servants of other powerful beings try to sty­
mie your patron's plans, while misguided (or entirely 
justified) monster hunters seek to rid the world of 
their ancient foe. An ancient being's lengthy history 
inspires unusual and potent enemies.


The Ancient Being Quests table presents a
few options for the sorts of work your patron ex­
pects from you.


ANCIENT BEING QUESTS
d6 Quest 
Rescue. A wayward agent went missing while gath­
ering inf ormation or materials. You must discover 
their fate and recover them and their findings. 
2 Sabotage. You must destroy an aspect of a rival's 
organization, either assassina ting a key minion or 
destroying a critical object. 
3 Artifice. Your specialized skills are instrumental to 
assembling compone nts for a powerful magic ritual 
or object.
4 Treachery. A high-profile minion of another power­
ful figure is in a position to betray their master, to 
the benefit of your patron. You must convince them 
to defect to your organization or extract them from 
now-hostile territory. 
5 Culling. A respected agent of your patron (possibly 
an ally or a mentor for your group) has been com­
promised. Perhaps they are defecting to a rival, 
attempting to seize the ancient being's power. 
Whatever the case, you must catch them to end 
their threat. 
6 Astral Heist. A powerful rival of your patron stores 
their secrets in a mind vault on the Astral Plane.


That means they can't be tricked or coerced into
revealing anything , nor can their thoughts be read. 
You must find the vault and travel through the ri­
val's deadly memories to find the knowledge your 
patron desires.

Your group serves at the pleasure of a member of
the nobility. Motivated by money, power, and pol­
itics, your patron uses your group to further their 
agenda without dirtying their hands, or perhaps 
they send you to the palaces of their enemies as en­
voys of peace. In exchange for loyalty and discretion, 
your patron is a powerful ally whose favor bestows 
far more than gold.


TYPES OF ARISTOCRATS
From the heads of scheming merchant families 
to immortal sorcerer -queens, each member of the 
aristocracy holds a measure of wealth and power­
and they desire more. The rulers of a barony could 
struggle to reclaim the influence they once held, 
while the new head of a business dynasty might 
seek to catapult their fortunes to new heights. By 
aligning with such patrons, you stand to benefit 
enormously from the fruits of their ambition. 
Roll or pick from the Aristocrat Types table to de­
termine what kind of noble you serve.


ARISTOCRAT TYPES
d6 Aristocrats 
Local Lord. Convinced that power and prestige lie 
just around the corner, this minor lord ling grasps 
for every opportunity to climb the ranks. 
2 Merchant Mastermind. Reputation, wealth, and 
power are one and the same for the head of a family 
with world-spanning business holdings. 
3 Nomadic Princeling. Nothing is more appealing to 
this princeling than treasure. Their sprawling mer ­
chant caravan trails behind their palanquin as far as 
the eye can see. 
4 Double Dealer. The leader of a noble family has 
turned against their nation, secretly opposing their 
liege for personal gain or ethical reasons. 
5 Ambiti_ous Entrepreneur. The sole heir of a vast 
fortune, this entrepreneur seeks allies to expand 
their wealth in a new business on the international, 
global, or planar stage. 
6 Future Ruler. This young noble is destined to rule, 
but currently their whims are fickle and dangerous. ARISTOCRAT PERKS 
With an aristocrat as your group's patron, you gain 
the following perks. 
Expenses. Your patron reimburses you for ex­
traordinary expenses incurred as part of your work.


You are required to account for your expenses and
must explain any extraordinary expenditures, but 
routine travel, ordinary equipment, and basic ser­
vices don't draw a second glance. 
Immun ity. As long as you remain in the aristo­
crat's good graces, you are nearly immune to prose­
cution under the laws within the aristocrat's sphere 
of influence. When you are carrying out your orders, 
you have a great deal of leeway in how you choose to 
go about that, and the law isn't an obstacle. Commit­
ting serious crimes-especiall y if they are unrelated 
or unnecessar y for the assigned work-is a sure way 
to fall out of your patron's good graces, however. 
Luxur y. Your patron deigns to host you at their 
home or in other luxurious accommodations for a 
brief period as reward for a job well done. Such a 
stay typically lasts for no longer than two weeks per 
year, during which you maintain an aristocratic life­
style for no cost. You must defend the locale if nec­
essary, but you're largely afforded time to relax as 
you please. However, poor (or outright destructive) 
guests rarely receive invitations to stay again. 
CHAP TER 2 / GROUP PATRONS 89 
Salar y. Your employment under an aristocratic 
patron brings an income of 1 gp per day, or enough 
to maintain a modest lifestyle. At the DM's discre­
tion, your salary increases or decreases depending 
on the aristocrat's nature, the type of work, and the 
length of your employment.


ARISTOCRAT CONTACT
Aside from a few exceptions, aristocrats prefer to 
have someone else handle communication with the 
hired help. As a result, you commun icate with an 
intermediary who serves as a go-between in your 
dealings with your patron.


Roll or pick from the Aristocrat Contact table to
determine who serves as your patron's proxy.


ARISTOCRAT CONTACT
d6 Contact 
Common Contact. A servant with ambitions toward 
a title works as a go-between for your patron. 
2 Professional. A level-headed advisor or manager of 
your patron's business directs you in keeping their 
reckless employer safe. 
3 Family Peacemaker. A naive aristocrat appointed by 
your patron wants your assistance in keeping the 
peace between fractious family members, which 
isn't your patron's priority. 
4 Intimate Connection. A common-born confidant or 
lover of your patron guides you in creating circum­
stances to bolster the noble family's best interests. 
S Outside Insider. An outcast noble favored by your 
patron works with you to uphold their family's inter­
ests despite their exile. 
6 Outsider Inside. A mysterious entity manipula tes 
a noble family's fortunes. Through your patron, it 
employs you to help guide its chosen family along a 
centurie s-long course.


ARISTOCRAT RETAINERS
Aristocrats seek agents to pursue business, polit­
ical, criminal, or personal agendas. In return, you 
might serve an aristocrat merely for the salary or to 
gain access to particular tools, information, or polit­
ical clout. Or you could be a lesser family member, 
expected to serve the will of family leaders. Regard­
less of your skills or social standing, aristocratic 
patrons with enough foresight and imagination find 
a use for agent� from any background.

TYPES OF CRIMINAL SYNDICA TES
Criminal syndicates range from the local thieves' 
guild, to a corrupt consortium of merchant princes, 
to a ring of otherworldly invaders infiltrating all 
levels of society for a nefarious purpose. Whatever 
form it takes, the syndicate is largely concerned 
with increasing wealth for its members at the ex­
pense of society at large. 
Conversely, the syndicate could be an under­
ground organization of good-hearted people fight­
ing against a wicked power structure. Criminal 
syndicates with a heroic bent include the band of 
plucky outlaws who hijack taxes from the cruel 
baron and return them to the downtrodden and a 
hard-bitten ring of deserters who fight their home­
land's invaders.

2 Assassin Society. The network's livelihood is death. 
Members of the society hone their skills as cut­
throats, poisoners, body-disposal specialists, and 
any other profession focused on ending lives. The

a greater cause.

the wrong person, or simply for being born into a 
family that's already in conflict with powerful, un­
scrupulous people. staggering magical might for those who meet their 
demands. 
4 Pirate Fleet. This alliance of pirate captains is uni­
fied under a ruling captain or admiral and adheres 
to a strict code of honor. They converge only in re­
sponse to an outside threat. 
5 Body Snatchers. The syndicate consists predomi­
nantly, if not entirely, of creatures that possess or 
impersonate other people. They seek to replace 
influential individuals throughout society with mem­
bers of their ranks. 
6 Thought Thieves. These psychic criminals infiltrate 
their target's minds to steal secrets and disguise 
their existence. 
CHAP TER 2 I GROUP PATRONS 91


CRIMINAL SYNDICATE PERKS
With the criminal syndicate as your group's patron, 
you gain the following perks. 
Assignments. The syndicate doesn't pay you 
directly, but it assigns you to particular tasks on 
behalf of its clients or the organization. Someone 
hires the syndicate to perform a task (such as an 
assassina tion), and the syndicate passes 85 percent 
of the fee on to your group. If the aim is to enrich 
the syndicate (such as by pulling off a heist), you 
have the privilege of keeping 85 percent of what you 
steal. Other syndicates take more or less than a 15 
percent share, at the DM's discretion. 
Cont raband. You have access to your syndicate's 
business in contraband, such as poisons or narcot­
ics. You don't receive a discount on these goods, but 
you can always find someplace to purchase them. 
Fen ces. Members or associates of your syndi­
cate are skilled at disposing of stolen goods, and 
you have access to this service as well. Fences 
are useful for selling not just illicit goods but also 
expensive items such as works of art and magic 
items. In the case of magic items, this allows you to 
delegate the work of finding a buyer (a downtime ac­
tivity described in the Dungeon Master's Guide and 
Xanathar's Guide to Everything) to the fence. When 
using the syndicate's fences, you run no risk of a 
double-cross or other mishap in finding a buyer, but 
the syndicate takes 20 percent of the sale price as a 
finder's fee. 
Safe Houses. The syndicate maintains safe 
houses or other secret hiding spots across a wide 
region. Your group knows how to locate these non­
descript redoubts and can maintain a poor lifestyle 
in one for no cost. Revealing a safe house, whether 
purposefully or by accident, causes you to lose favor 
with the syndicate and may see you banned from 
using them. 
Syn dicate-Owned Busi nesses. The syndicate 
owns several businesses, primarily as fronts for 
laundering money. When you buy from one of these 
businesses, you get a 5 percent discount. The DM 
decides what goods and services are available.


CRIMINAL SYNDICATE CONTACT
Each member of the syndicate has a place in the 
organization. You report to a contact who handles 
your contribution by giving you assignments, collect­
ing the syndicate's cut of your swag, or seeing that 
you receive your fee for contract work from outside 
clients. The contact is your first point of communica­
tion if you need to reach out to highly ranked mem­
bers of the syndicate's hierarchy.

shares their connections with you. 
3 Former Law Enforcement. Your contact used to be

CRIMINAL SYNDICA TE MEMBERS
Whether you're a lifelong scoundrel or an ambi· 
tious upstart, you seek to gain wealth, fame, and 
influence within a criminal syndicate. A syndicate 
is motivated by profit, employing agents with all 
manner of talents. Nimbleness and novelty prove 
vital not just to exploiting untapped prospects but to 
avoiding the law. You embody rare experience and 
skill, positioned at the forefront of daring new crim­
inal ventures.

CRIMINAL SYNDICATE QUESTS
Your work as a syndicate member involves more 
than simple street swindles or pickpock eting.


Someone with your skills cooperates with others
for greater purposes that offer both dangerous 
risks and splendid rewards. The law of the land 
is your most persistent enemy, but other crimi­
nal syndicates challenge you as well-or become 
your targets.


The Criminal Syndicate Quests table explores
what kind of work you do for the organization.

Acquisition and Retrieval. You acquire assets for the 
syndicate. You steal important docume nts or clear 
out locations for use as hideouts.

that require the combined skills of your team. 
3 Gang Warfare. You ensure that no other crime syn­

avaricious members of your syndicate in line with 
the goals and rules of the organization.

Your group has ties to a powerful consortium of
professionals who work together for mutual benefit. 
You might be long-time members of such a guild, de­
scended from a family of crafters or merchants from 
which you inherited membership, or perhaps you're 
working to earn entrance on your own merits. If you 
serve the guild's interests well, it promises to take 
care of you. Guilds hate to waste valuable assets, 
after all-that's just bad business. TYPES OF GUILD 
The guild structure covers a swath of business ven­
tures, differentiated by their specialty. A conglom­
erate of blacksmiths, jewelers, carpenters, tailors, 
alchemists, scribes, and sages all could organize as 
a guild. Whatever their trade, these experts share 
contacts, exchange resources such as materials or 
tools, and leverage their collective influence to affect 
politics for their benefit. Alternatively, merchants 
and other business owners might also organize into 
guilds. Merchant barons who effectively rule a city 
or nation through iron-clad control of the economy 
or a network of innkeepers who share news and 
supply routes could both represent guild patrons. 
A guild could even embody a more sinister group, 
such as one that deals in terrifying wares like 
deadly monsters, dangerous knowledge, or souls. 
Roll or pick from the Guild Types table to deter­
mine the general sort of organization you oper­
ate within.


GUILD TYPES
d6 Guild 
Crafters' Guild. This conglomer ate of artisans pools 
its resou rces and influence to ensure a steady ex­
change of gold for its crafts. 
2 Merchant Consortium. These entrepreneurs don't 
create the wares they peddle, instead specializing in 
linking products to prospective owners. If they don't 
have it, they find it. 
3 Miracle Makers' Association. The magically inclined 
crafters of this guild specialize in imbuing physical 
goods with magical effects. Rumor has it they can 
strip the magic from existing enchanted items and 
might be willing to buy or trade adventurers' spoils. 
4 Moneychangers. These merchants deal in all forms 
of currency, acting as bankers, loan agents, and cru­
cial contacts for adventurers and other individuals 
who deal with large sums of wealth. They exchange 
coin for gemstones as readily as they find buyers for 
historical relics and recovered art. 
5 Philosophical Faction. These like-minded individuals 
follow specific teachings, spreading word of their 
expertise through their services and training. 
6 Identity Traders. These enigmatic dealers buy and 
sell documents, memories, and the trappings of 
thoroughly lived lives, selling them to those in need 
of the ultimate fresh start.

GUILD PERKS
With a guild as your group's patron, you gain the 
following perks. These perks require an annual 
contribution of 15 gp paid to the guild (replacing the 
5 gp per month cost for characters with the Guild 
Artisan background). These dues fund the guild's 
services and activities. 
Accomm odations. You can stay at your organi­
zation's guildhall. The rooms are comparable to 
those in a comfortable inn, but at a modest price (5 
sp per day). 
Equipm ent. You can requisition the use of spe­
cialized tools, laboratories, libraries, or other craft­
ing space and equipment to use within the guildhall. 
When you make an ability check with a set of arti­
san's tools using the guild's equipment, add double 
your normal proficiency bonus to the check. 
Resources. You can leverage the guild's exten­
sive contacts to locate exotic materials for crafting, 
spell components, or magic items, or buyers for 
them (a downtime activity in the Dungeon Master's 
Guide and Xanathar's Guide to Everything). You 
94 CHAPTER 2 I GROU P PATRONS can locate or sell legal commodities using the 
guild's resources, and any prices tip in your favor by 
10 percent. 
Training. The guild retains knowledgeable tutors 
in subjects pertinent to its interests. When you un­
dertake the training downtime activity (as described 
in the Player's Handbook and Xanathar's Guide to 
Everything), the training takes half as long if you 
are studying a subject the guild specializes in. The


DM decides if the guild has tutors available for a
given subject.


GUILD CONTACT
Even as a member in good standing of the guild, 
you can't simply stroll up to the guild master and 
d.emand their attention. Your superiors within the 
guild manage work contracts, request the use of 
guild resources, and facilitate getting your group 
in contact with the right people to assist their 
interests. 
Roll or pick from the Guild Contact table to deter­
mine your immediate contact within the guild.


GUILD CONTACT
d6 Contact 
The Perfectionist. Your contact is a skilled but ob­
sessive creator consumed with the quest to create 
something perfect that will define their life's work 
and secure their legacy. They lose sight of right and 
wrong in pursuit of the finest materials and exciting 
opportunities. 
2 .Attentive Overseer. A guild representative takes 
personal interest in your group's tasks. They follow 
your exploits and know of your adventures before 
you return to report. Despite the unsettling dep th 
of their knowledge, they seem genuinely eager to 
shepherd your work. 
3 Hidden Benefactor. Whoever your contact is, they 
don't communicate directly. They send messages 
via couriers or letters. No one in the guild knows 
who the contact is, or if they do, they aren't telling 
you. Regardless, the contact's information is good, 
and they pay on time. 
4 Discerning Mentor. No matter how well you per­
form, or how perfect your creations, nothing is ever 
good enough for this contact. They point out every 
flaw and missed opportunity. Are they bitter, lashing 
out at anyone around them, or do they recognize 
your potential and try to push you to greatness? 
5 Golem Guide. Your guild contact is the soul of a 
long-dead artisan preserved in a construct body. 
This golem is wise and knowledgea ble, but it has 
difficulty grasping the passage of time and the state 
of the world compared to its original era. 
6 Fallen Muse. Your contact is a fallen celestial.


Whether they regret their transgressions or hunger
for vengeance, they provide divine inspiration and 
guidance to you and to the guild. Somehow your 
group and the guild inspire their hope for ascension.


GUILD REPRESENTATIVES
As a guild member, you might be a professional 
who works directly toward the guild's specialty or 
whose fortunes align with the guild's interests. Al­
ternatively, you could provide the guild with services 
to which their members aren't suited. For example, 
guards, explorers, negotiators, and spies can be 
useful to a guild, whether its interests lie in trade 
goods, entertainment, or more questionable ven­
tures. Whether a guild operates entirely within the 
law and how public its interests are also influences 
which of your skills it deems most valuable.

As a member of the guild, you're called on to ply 
your skills in the organization's service. You are 
required to undertake various tasks, either for the 
guild's benefit or on behalf of an influential client. 
Competition is fierce in the business world, and the 
challeng es presented by rivals or circumstances can 
pressure you into dealings you find distastef ul.


The Guild Quests table presents a few options for
the sorts of work the guild requires of you.


GUILD QUESTS
d6 Quest 
Deliver Goods. You need to deliver an order to an 
important customer or partner of the guild. The de­
livery must arrive by a critical deadline-regard less 
of who or what tries to stop you. 
2 Acquire Materials. Your guild requires materials 
that are rare and difficult to procure, either for a 
guild project or for a paying client. Your group must 
gather the missing components from a dangerous 
location or a recalcitrant owner while outpacing a 
rival to the prize. 
3 Eliminate a Rival. A competitor has humiliated the 
guild one too many times, and it's time for that to 
stop. Your group is charged with assuring the rival 
never darkens the guild's reputation again. Can you 
trick them into permanent disgrace, or must you 
resort to more direct methods? 
4 The Masterpiece. An exquisite work of art for an 
influential client, either created by your guild or ac­
quired through agents, has gone missing. You must 
track down its whereabout s and secure it before 
time runs out and the guild suffers a penalty.

acquire something wondrous for a wealthy but 
secretive client's collection. Guild members who

missing. The collector promises to return your com­
rades if you provide what the collector seeks, but if 
you fail, you'll become part of the collection.

TASHA
Your group serves as a team of soldiers in a larger 
military force, one dedicated to combat missions or
other dangerous tasks. You could be a band of mer­
cenaries, a special forces unit, or a squad of regular 
infantry. Perhaps you protect a nation's people from 
monsters, or you fight secret battles in the wake 
of a war that has supposedly ended. Or the nation 
requires military forces at the edges of civilization 
to protect the frontier and to lead advancement into 
new territory.


ITPES OF MILITARY FORCES
Military forces represent a variety of organized 
bands of warriors. They can be the disciplined reg­
iments of a nation's standing army, a fleet of ships 
comprising a kingdom's armada, or a devastating 
horde of warriors and magical beasts. A given king­
dom's military could be a rigidly ordered force or a 
blood-soaked throng.

functioning like a pyramid of smaller armies. Horde 
commander s owe fealty to stronger leaders above 
them, all the way up to the warlord. 
5 Planar Conscripts. This military force battles for cos­
mic stakes on far-flung planes of the multiverse or 
fights against extraplanar invasion on the Material 
Plane. Warriors include conscripts pressed into ser­
vice in the Blood War, fod der in the thrall of ruthless 
yugoloth mercenaries, or members of a glorious ce­
lestial host defending against fiendish incursion. 
6 Sky Warriors. This military force consists of winged 
creatures, employs magical flight, or sails airships 
as a sky navy. Traditional defenses are ineffective 
against attacks from the air, positioning the sky war­
riors as a fearsome nation or expensive and coveted 
mercenaries.


MILITARY FORCE PE RKS
With a military force as your group's patron, you 
gain the following perks. 
Arm ory. You can purchase nonmagical weapons 
and armor at a 20 percent discount at a facility 
associated with your military force. You can buy 
magic items at the DM's discretion, but you receive 
no discount. 
Chain of Command. You are part of a hierarchy 
that provides you with orders. If you cause trouble 
fo your own nation, you answer to your officers, not 
local law enforcement. 
Oflicial Access. Your rank in the military force 
grants you access to places that are off limits to 
civilians. With your commander's permission, you 
can enter dangerous training grounds or military in­
stallations, like an army's regional headquarters or 
a repository of top-secret intelligence. You can also 
request that your commander grant you authority 
to act in their name or provide access to experts or 
leaders higher in the chain of command. 
Orders. You undertake your missions at the di­
rection of a commanding officer, who expects your 
absolute obedience. These missions have clear and 
precise goals, leading you on the path of adventure. 
In rare cases, you're trusted with open-ended tasks 
that afford you leeway in interpreting orders. 
Salary. Each member of your group earns a regu­
lar salary or share of the military force's spoils. The 
amount varies depending on your organization and 
your position within it, but at minimum you enjoy a 
modest lifestyle. You receive a small salary (as little 
as 1 sp per day) and food and housing on a military 
base. Or you receive 1 gp per day but rely on that 
money for room and board. With higher rank comes 
higher pay. As an officer, you maintain a comfortable 
lifestyle.


MILITARY FORCE CONTACT
Your primary contact within your hierarchy is your 
superior officer, the person who gives you orders 
and is responsible for your success or failure.


Roll or pick from the Military Force Contact table
to determine who assigns you missions.


COMMANDING OFFICER
d6 Officer 
Tested Veteran. Your commander is a battle-scarred 
officer who experienced horrors in combat. They 
rely on something to dull the pain of their memorie s 
or wounds, from a favorite writer's prose to a dis­
tracting vice. 
2 Taskmaster. This angry officer yells every order, 
reprimands you for the smallest mistake, and fully 
expects you to fail at every mission you undertake. 
This might be tough love or simple brutishness. 
3 Protective Officer. A kindly officer is hesitant to send 
you into danger and constantly reminds you to be 
careful. 
4 Bitter Soldier. Your commander carries deep
grudges against your force's enemies. They leap at 
any chance to do those foes harm, even if it puts 
your group in terrible risk. 
5 Hopeful Commander. This optimistic officer knows 
that a new era of peace is just over the horizon. You 
just need to complete these last few missions, then 
it should all finally be over. 
6 Devout Leader. Your commander is a person of 
deep faith. They believe that your success or failure 
lies entirely in divine hands and you are the instru­
ments of that will. MILITARY FORCE ENVOYS


You might join a military force for a wide range of
reasons, or the military has reasons for seeking 
you out. Those with specialized skills contribute to 
a range of missions, from infiltration and mystical 
operations to diplomacy and strategy. Perhaps your 
past deeds or the will of your family pushes you 
toward military service, regardless of whether you 
believe you're suited to such a life.

98 CHAP TER 2 I GROUP PATRONS TYPES OF RELIGIOUS ORDERS


Not every religious order represents an alliance of
worshipers devoted to godly ideals. Perhaps your 
group is a team of devotees pursuing a cause for 
your faith, or maybe you're a bunch of cynics taking 
advantage of a wealthy congregation. Your collec­
tive faith could compel you to hunt evil monsters or 
stave off otherworldly invasions, to protect the pow­
erless from oppression, or to spread the teachings of 
your religion in a hostile land. Or perhaps you serve 
a corrupt hier archy by making its enemies quietly 
disappear-though even cynical mercenaries can 
become true believers when confronted with the 
miraculous.

6 Doomsaying Evangelists. This order believes the 
world is about to end. They're convinced that if they 
persuade everyone else of this fact they might stave 
off the impending doom.


RELIGIOUS ORDER PERKS
With a religious order as your group' s patron, you 
gain the following perks. 
. Divin e Servi ce. In times of need, your group can 
appeal to the priests of your faith for magical aid. 
An NPC cleric or druid of your faith who is of suf­
ficiently high level casts any spell of up to 5th level 
on your group's behalf, without charge. The caster 
provides any costly material components needed for 
the spell, as long as you demonstrate your need and 
are in good standing with the faith. 
Equi pment. Each member of your party has a 
holy symbol or druidic focus, even if it isn't needed 
for spellcasting. Each of you also has a book con­
taining prayers, rites, and scriptures of your faith. 
Proficienci es. Each member of your party gains 
proficiency in the Religion skill, if the character 
doesn't already have it.


RELIGIOUS ORDER CONTACT
Your established order enjoys a robust following. It 
might be a cloister of priestly scholars who use your 
group as the adventuring arm of the organization, 
or perhaps a legion of paladins who call on your 
group's finesse where swords and shields fail. You 
might receive orders directly from the immortal

RELIGIOUS ORDER QUESTS


The services you provide your religious order vary
depending on the deity you serve and your party's 
aptitudes. Regardless, religious orders are opposed 
by antagonistic faiths, foes whose rivalry with your 
order emulates the conflict between your respective 
gods. Some religious orders also hunt and destroy 
fiends, undead, or other beings they consider abom­
inations, seeking to rid the word of their influence. 
Others root out heretics, real or imagined, to 
demonstrate the primacy of their deity.

TA�HA · 
A leader without allies is not long a leader. You 
serve a sovereign-a national figure or otherwise­
and work to achieve their goals no matter the cost. 
As agents of a sovereign, you serve as diplomats 
or enforcers, spies or fixers, bringers of aid or exec­
utors of justice. You work within the system to up­
hold the status quo or step beyond the law to prevent 
war and worse. Politics, espionage, and mystery are 
facts of your world, as is hope and the fragile prom­
ise of peace.


TYPES OF SOVEREIGNS
Broadly defined, a sovereign ranges from the head 
of a government to the leader of a powerfu l, private 
institution. Queens, chieftains, sultans, and rajahs 
are ready choices for powerful individuals who pa­
tronize a party of adventurers. Those on track to be­
come such individuals-such as cunning senators, 
royal heirs, or influential celebrities-also fill a sov­
ereign's role. When choosing or creating a sovereign 
to serve, consider whether that leader commands a 
government organization or another faction. While 
this section assumes your patron is the head of a 
country or other national body, they could oversee 
a powerful private division, a cult of personal ity, or 
an elaborate expedition. Also, consider the scale of 
your patron's organization. While serving as spies 
engaging in international intrigues could lead to 
world-changing escapades, being fixers for the 
mayor of a struggling town offers a personal con­
nection to a place and its people. 
Roll or pick from the Sovereign Types table to de­
termine what sort of liege you serve.


SOVEREIGN TYPES
d6 Sovereign 
Village Elder. The wizened leader of a community 
offers both civic and moral leadership. 
2 Young Noble. An ambitious noble eagerly seeks to 
reform society to align with a personal vision. 
3 Shipwrecked Governor. A desperate leader struggles 
to keep people alive in a wilderness they're not pre· 
pared to endure. 
4 Ruler Returned. A tribe's revered leader has re· 
turned from the dead and seeks to resurrect their 
past glories. 
5 Hidden Power. A mysterious figure manipulates the 
nation's puppet leader and guides the government's 
true agenda. 
6 True Regent. The rightful heir to the throne strug· 
gles to reclaim power from a perfect impostor.


SOVEREIGN PERKS
With the sovereign as your group's patron, you gain 
the following perks. 
Elite Access. While in service to the sovereign, 
you have access to the highest echelons of society. 
With your patron's permission, you can gain access 
to the halls of power, from national capitols and 
military headquarters to noble estates and troves 
of state secrets. You can also request that the sov­
ereign grant you access to perks of their position, 
like access to diplomatic receptions or use of the 
royal guards. 
Expenses. Your patron reimburses you for ex­
traordinary expenses incurred as part of your work.


You are required to account for your expenses and
must explain any extraordinary expenditures, but 
routine travel, ordinary equipment, and basic ser­
vices don't draw a second glance. Immun ity. As Jong as you remain in the sov­
ereign's good graces, you are nearly immune to 
prosecution under the laws within their sphere of 
influence. When you are carrying out your orders, 
you have a great deal of leeway in how you choose to 
go about that, and the Jaw isn't an obstacle. Commit­
ting serious crimes-especiall y if they are unrelated 
or unnecessar y for the assigned work-is a sure way 
to fall out of your patron's good graces, however. 
Salar y. Your employment under a sovereign pa­
tron brings an income of 1 gp per day, or enough to 
maintain a modest lifestyle. At the DM's discretion, 
your salary increases or decreases depending on 
the sovereign's nature, the type of work you per­
form, and the length of your employment. 
CHAPTER 2 I GROUP PATRONS IOI


SOVEREIGN CONTACT
You might benefit from direct contact with your 
group patron. This includes audiences or secret 
meetings with the sovereign, depending on the na­
ture of your work. Alternat ively, the sovereign might 
purposefully wantto keep their distance from you, 
either due to their bus y schedules or to maintain 
plausible deniability regarding your work. In such 
cases, an advisor or functionary oversees your as­
signments, serving as the primary contact between 
you and the sovereign.


Roll or pick from the Sovereign Contact table to
determine who manages the relationship between 
you and the throne, if not the sovereign directly.


SOVEREIGN CONTACT
d6 Contact 
Intimate Confidant. The sovereign's friend or lover 
seeks to aid their companion in any way possible. 
2 Spymaster. An intelligence operative attends to the 
nation's dirty work so the sovereign keeps their 
hands clean. 
3 Administrator. This severe bureaucrat disagrees 
with many of the sovereign's policies but takes loyal 
service seriously. 
4 Executive Assistant. The responsibilities of an exact­
ing butler or other servant at the royal household far 
exceed their title. 
5 Envoy. A semi-retired, leisure-loving ambassador 
speaks in suggestion and innuendo. 
6 Spectral Assembly. A ghostly council of the nation's 
previous regents manifests to avert disasters.


SOVEREIGN PROXIES
You serve a sovereign out of national pride, out of 
tradition, or for your own practical reasons. The 
needs of a leader potentially embroil you directly in 
political intrigues, court maneuverings, or threats 
from national foes. It's up to you and the sovereign 
to determine whether your work is publicly acknowl­
edged or top secret-and if the latter, what happens 
if your work is exposed.


The Sovereign Proxy Roles table suggests ways
you might serve a sovereign and the backgrounds 
frequently associated with each role.

SOVEREIGN QUESTS


The services you provide a sovereign largely depend
on the nature of your group patron and their nation. 
While some of your missions involve official tasks­
missions undertaken in the sovereign's name-oth­
ers might be covert, making your patron's identity a 
highly guarded secret. Political rivals, enemy coun­
tries, and natural disasters all pose dangers to the 
sovereign's nation. Yet a sovereign who sows chaos, 
enacts tyrannical decrees, or jeopardizes a popu­
lation's way of life is likely to inspire rebellions. In 
such cases, a sovereign's agents must decide where 
their loyalties lie.


The Sovereign Quests table presents a few of the
sorts of missions you undertak e for your liege.


SOVEREIGN QUESTS
d6 Quest 
International Espionage. You attempt to steal intelli­
gence, national symbols, or super weapons from an 
enemy power. 
2 Undermine Rival. You seek to weaken or remove 
a rival to the regent's rule-perhap s a general, an 
archdruid, or a noble with a claim to the throne. 
3 Expel Corruption. You help the sovereign reform 
their government, rooting out institutional vices. 
4 Subvert Blame. The sovereign is caught in an em­
barrassing affair. Make it disappear. 
5 Test Heir. You prepare the sovereign's heir for the 
challenge of taking the throne. 
6 Desperate Diplomacy. You seek to make peace with 
a force or entity that could wipe out your nation.


BEING YOUR OWN PAT RON
For some players, the idea of running a crime syn­
dicate, mercenary company, arcane scholars' collec­
tive, or other organization is far more exciting than 
working for someone else. Founding your own orga­
nization offers a greater degree of autonom y, though 
potentially at the cost of support and reliable work. 
When you're the boss, the perks of belonging to 
an organization become expenses you have to worry 
about; when you run your own mercenary company, 
for example, you need to stock your own armory, 
rather than drawing on an existing organization's 
stockpile. The organization brings in income, 
but you'll have to spend it to keep the organiza-
tion running. When you run your own organization, use the 
Running a Business downtime activity (described in 
the Dungeon Master's Guide) to reflect your organi­
zation's ongoing activities. More than one character 
can take part in this activity at a time. When rolling 
to determine the business's performance, add the 
total days spent by the characters to the roll to de­
termine the business's success (still observing the 
maximum of 30). If the business earns a profit, mul­
tiply that profit by 4 + the number of characters who 
took part in this downtime activity.


Don't discount the value of adopting an NPC to
serve as your contact within your own organization. 
A secretary, majordomo, or apprentice keeps up 
with your group's bureaucracy while you're con­
ducting missions and passes along information that 
could lead to your next adventure!

MAGICA L MISCELLANY
AGIC IS EVERY WHERE IN D&D. MANY 
creatures in the D&D multiverse ex-
ist solely because of the influence of 
magic, spellcasters harness magical 
energy every day in the form of spells, and supernat ­
ural power thrums at the heart of the magic items 
sought by adventurers. This chapter is all about 
those last two things-spells and magic items.


The chapter first presents new spells for player
characters and monsters to use. Those spells are 
followed by suggestions on customizing the look 
of your spells. The chapter then offers a selection 
of new magic items, including artifacts of mythic 
power and magic items that can be printed on one's 
body in the form of tattoos.


The DM decides how the options in this chapter
appear in a campaign and may choose to use some, 
all, or none of them, so make sure to let your DM 
know which options you'd most like to use in play.

SPELL DESCRIP TIONS
The spells are presented in alphabetical order.


BLADE OF DISASTER
9th-level conjuration 
Casting Time: 1 bonus action 
Range: 60 feet 
Components: V, S 
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute 
You create a blade-shaped planar rift about 3 feet 
long in an unoccupied space you can see within 
range. The blade lasts for the duration. When you 
cast this spell, you can make up to two melee spell 
attacks with the blade, each one against a creature, 
loose object, or structure within 5 feet of the blade. 
On a hit, the target takes 4d12 force damage. This 
attack scores a critical hit if the number on the d20 
is 18 or higher. On a critical hit, the blade deals 
an extra 8dl2 force damage (for a total of 12d12 
force damage). 
As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the 
blade up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can 
see and then make up to two melee spell attacks 
with it again. 
The blade can harmless ly pass through any bar­
rier, including a wall of force.


BOOMIN G BLADE
Evocation cantrip 
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: Self (5-foot radius) 
Components: S, M (a melee weapon worth at 
least 1 sp) 
Duration: 1 round 
You brandish the weapon used in the spell's cast­
ing and make a melee attack with it against one 
creature within 5 feet of you. On a hit, the target 
suffers the weapon attack's normal effects and then 
becomes sheathed in booming energy until the start 
of your next turn. If the target willingly moves 5 feet 
or more before then, the target takes ld8 thunder 
damage, and the spell ends.


This spell's damage increases when you reach
certain levels. At 5th level, the melee attack deals an 
extra ld8 thunder damage to the target on a hit, and 
the damage the target takes for moving increases to 
2d8. Both damage rolls increase by ld8 at 11th level 
(2d8 and 3d8) and again at 17th level (3d8 and 4d8).


DREAM OF THE BLUE VEIL
7th-level conjuration 
Casting Time: 10 minutes 
Range: 20 feet 
Components: V, S, M (a magic item or a willing 
creature from the destination world) 
Duration: 6 hours 
106 CHAP TER 3 I MAGICAL MISCEL LANY TRAVELI NG TO OTHER WO RLDS 
The Material Plane holds an infinite number of worlds. 
Some-like Oerth, Tori!, Krynn, and Eberron-are well 
documented, but there are countless others. You and 
your friends may even have created some homemade 
D&D worlds yourselves! 
It was not always so. Various scholar s speak of a pri­
mordial state, a single reality they call the First World, 
which preceded the multiverse as we know it. Many 
of the peoples and monsters that inhabit the worlds 
in the Material Plane originated there. After the First


World was shattered by a great cataclysm-giving
birth to the worlds that came in its wake-the progeny 
of the first elves, dwarves, beholders, and other iconic 
creatures took root on world after world, like seeds 
scattered by a cosmic wind. If the musings of these 
great sages are true, every world is a reflection-and 
in some cases, a distortion-of the First World. 
Transit between these worlds is rare but not im­
possible and can be accomplished in various ways. 
One such method is called the Great Journey, an epic 
voyage fraught with peril and littered with obstacles to 
be overcome. This journey most often occurs aboard a 
vessel powered by magic. 
Another method is the Dream of Other Worlds; trav­
elers fall into a deep slumber and dream themselves 
into a new realm. The spell dream of the blue veil em­
ploys this method of transit.


The most direct method is the Leap to Another
Realm; a spellcaster casts teleportation circle or tele­
port, aiming to appear in a known teleportation circle 
or some other location in another world. 
Whatever method you use to reach a world, the OM 
determines whether you succeed and where exactly 
you appear if you do arrive in that realm.


You and up to eight willing creatures within range
fall unconscious for the spell's duration and experi­
ence visions of another world on the Material Plane, 
such as Oerth, Tori!, Krynn, or Eberron. If the spell 
reaches its full duration, the visions conclude with 
each of you encountering and pulling back a mys­
terious blue curtain. The spell then ends with you 
mentally and physically transported to the world 
that was in the visions. 
To cast this spell, you must have a magic item that 
originated on the world you wish to reach, and you 
must be aware of the world's existence, even if you 
don't know the world's name. Your destination in the 
other world is a safe location within 1 mile of where 
the magic item was created. Alternatively, you can 
cast the spell if one of the affected creatures was 
born on the other world, which causes your destina­
tion to be a safe location within 1 mile of where that 
creature was born.


The spell ends early on a creature if that creature
takes any damage, and the creature isn't trans­
ported. If you take any damage, the spell ends for 
you and all the other creatures, with none of you 
being transported.


GREEN-FLAME BLADE
Evocation cantrip 
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: Self (5-foot radius) 
Components: S, M (a melee weapon worth at 
least 1 sp) · 
Duration: Instantan eous


You brandish the weapon used in the spell's casting
and make a melee attack with it against one crea­
ture within 5 feet of you. On a hit, the target suffers 
the weapon attack's normal effects, and you can 
cause green fire to leap from the target to a different 
creature of your choice that you can see within 5 
feet of it. The second creature takes fire damage 
equal to your spellcasting ability modifier.


This spell's damage increases when you reach
certain levels. At 5th level, the melee attack deals an 
extra 1d8 fire damage to the target on a hit, and the 
fire damage to the second creature increases to 1d8 
+your spellcasting ability modifier. Both damage 
rolls increase by 1d8 at 11th level (2d8 and 2d8) and 
17th level (3d8 and 3d8).


INTELLECT FORTRESS
3rd-level abjuration 
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: 30 feet Components: V 
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour 
For the duration, you or one willing creature you 
can see within range has resistance to psychic dam­
age, as well as advantage on Intelligence, Wisdom, 
and Charisma saving throws. 
At Higher Lev els. When you cast this spell using 
a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can target one 
additional creature for each slot level above 3rd. The 
creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when 
you target them.


LIGHTNING LURE
Evocation cantrip 
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: Self (15-foot radius) 
Components: V 
Duration: Instantaneous


You create a lash of lightning ener gy that strikes
at one creature of your choice that you can see 
within 15 feet of you. The target must succeed on a 
Strength saving throw or be pulled up to 10 feet in a 
straight line toward you and then take 1d8 lightning 
damage if it is within 5 feet of you. 
This spell's damage increases by 1d8 when you 
reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th 
level (4d8).


MIND SLIVER
Enchantment cantrip 
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: 60 feet 
Components: V 
Duration: 1 round


You drive a disorienting spike of psychic energy into
the mind of one creature you can see within range.


The target must succeed on an Intelligence saving
throw or take ld6 psychic damage and subtract ld4 
from the next saving throw it makes before the end 
of your next turn. 
This spell's damage increases by ld6 when you 
reach certain levels: 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), 
and 17th level (4d6). 
108 CHAPTER 3 I MA GICAL MISCEL LANY SPIRIT SHROUD 
3rd-level necroma ncy 
Casting Time: 1 bonus action 
Range: Self 
Components: V, S 
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute 
You call forth spirits of the dead, which flit around 
you for the spell's duration. The spirits are intangi­
ble and invulnerable. 
Until the spell ends, any attack you make deals 
ld8 extra damage when you hit a creature within 10 
feet of you. This damage is radiant, necrotic, or cold 
(your choice when you cast the spell). Any creature 
that takes this damage can't regain hit points until 
the start of your next turn. 
In addition, any creature of your choice that you 
can see that starts its turn within 10 feet of you has 
its speed reduced by 10 feet until the start of your 
next turn. 
At Hig her Lev els. When you cast this spell using 
a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage in­
creases by ld8 for every two slot levels above 3rd.

Range: 90 feet 
Components: V,. S, M (a pickled tentacle and an eye-
ball in a platinum-inlaid vial worth at least 400 gp) 
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour 
You call forth an aberrant spirit. It manifests in an 
unoccupied space that you can see within range.


This corporeal form uses the Aberrant Spirit stat
block. When you cast the spell, choose Beholderkin, 
Slaad, or Star Spawn. The creature resembles an 
aberration of that kind, which determines certain 
traits in its stat block. The creature disappears 
when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends. 
The creature is an ally to you and your compan­
ions. In combat, the creature shares your initiative 
count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. 
It obeys your verbal commands (no action required 
by you). If you don't issue any, it takes the Dodge ac­
tion and uses its move to avoid danger.

Just as every performer lends their art a personal
flair and every warrior asserts their fighting styles 
through the lens of their own training, so too can a 
spellcaster use magic to express their individual ity. 
Regardless of what type of spellcaster you're play­
ing, you can customize the cosmetic effects of your 
character's spells. Perhaps you wish the effects of 
your caster's spells to appear in their favorite color, 
to suggest the training they received from a celestial 
mentor, or to exhibit their connection to a season 
of the year. The possibilities for how you might 
cosmetically customize your character's spells are 
endless. However, such alterations can't change the 
effects of a spell. They also can't make one spell 
seem like another-you can't, for example, make a 
magic missile look like a fireball. 
When customizing your spellcaster's magic, con­
sider developing a theme-o ften, the broader and 
more versatile the better. You may describe your 
caster's magic whenever you wish, particularly 
when it makes an interesting addition to a story.


You may also use it to reinforce other choices you've
made for your character, like making a bard's spells 
tied more closely to their favored art form or a cler­
ic's spells themed around their deity. 
For example, the fireball of a wizard with a 
fondness for storms might erupt to look like burn­
ing clouds or a burst of red lightning (without 
affecting the spell's damage type), while the same 
wizard's haste spell might limn the target in faint 
thunderheads. 
Alternat ively, a cleric who serves a moon god 
might radiate faint moonlight around their hands 
when they cast cure wounds, or their shield of faith 
might surround the target with glimmering cres­
cent moons. 
Further still, a druid could choose a cherry 
blossom theme for their magic, causing delicate 
branches and pink leaves to grow when they cast en­
tangle or shillelagh, and their faerie fire spell could 
appear more like wind-tossed petals than flames. 
The Magic Themes table offers just a few sugges­
tions that might inspire you while personalizing 
your character's spells.

attunement) 
Produced by a special needle, this magic tattoo fea­
tures designs that emphasize one color. 
Tattoo Attunement. To attune to this item, you 
hold the needle to your skin where you want the tat­
too to appear, pressing the needle there throughout 
the attunement process. When the attunement is 
complete, the needle turns into the ink that becomes 
the tattoo, which appears on the skin. 
If your attunement to the tattoo ends, the tattoo 
vanishes, and the needle reappears in your space. 
Damage Resis tance. While the tattoo is on 
your skin, you have resistance to a type of damage 
associated with that color, as shown on the table 
below. The DM chooses the color or determines 
it randoml y.

While holding this tool, you gain a bonus to the 
spell attack rolls and the saving throw DCs of your 
artificer spells. The bonus is determined by the 
tool's rarity. 
As an action, you can focus on the tool to channel

choice) to the original roll. You can do this after 
you see the roll but before its effects are applied.

BABA YAGA'S MORTAR AND PESTLE
Wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement)


The creations of the immortal hag Baba Yaga defy
the laws of mortal magic. Among the notorious 
implements that.cement her legend on countless 
worlds are the artifacts that propel her through 
the planes: Baba Yaga's Mortar and Pestle. These 
signature tools of Baba Yaga are a single artifact 
for purposes of attunement. Should the two objects 
become separated, the pestle appears next to the 
mortar at the next dawn. 
Random Prop ertie s. This artifact has the follow­
ing random properties, which you can determine by 
rolling on the tables in the "Artifacts" section of the 
Dungeon Master's Guide: 
• 2 minor beneficial properties 
• 1 major beneficial property 
• 1 minor detrimental property 
Prop erties of the Mortar. The mortar is a Tiny 
wooden bowl. However, the mortar increases in 
size to accommoda te anything you place inside, ex­
panding-if there's enough space-up to Large size, 
meaning it can hold even a Large creature. 
Properties of the Pestle. The pestle is a 6-inch­
long, worn wooden tool. Once during your turn 
while you are holding the pestle, you can extend it 
into a quarterstaff or shrink it back into a pestle (no 
action required). As a quarterstaff, the pestle is a 
magic weapon that grants a +3 bonus to attack and 
damage rolls made with it. 
The pestle has 12 charges. When you hit with a 
melee attack using the pestle, you can expend up to 
3 of its charges to deal an extra ld8 force damage 
for each charge expended. The pestle regains all ex­
pended charges daily at dawn. 
Perf ect Tools. While holding the mortar and pes­
tle, you can use your action to say the name of any 
nonmagical plant, mineral, or fluid and an amount 
of the material worth 10 gp or less. The mortar in­
stantly fills with the desired amount of that material. 
Once you use this action, you can't do so again until 
you finish a short or long rest. 
You can also use the artifact as alchemist's sup­
plies, brewer's supplies, cook's utensils, an herb­
alism kit, and a poisoner's kit. You have advantage 
on any check you make using the artifact as one of 
these tools. 
Prim al Parts. As an action while the pestle and 
the mortar ,is within 5 feet of you, you can command 
the pestle to grind. For the next minute, or until you 
use your action to verbally command it to stop, the 
pestle moves on its own, grinding the contents of 
the mortar into a mush or fine powder that's equally 
useful for cooking or alchemy. At the start of each 
of your turns, whatever is in the mortar takes 4d10 
force damage. If this reduces the target's hit points to 0, the target is reduced to powder, pulp, or paste, 
as appropriate. Only magic items are unaffected. If 
you wish, when the pestle stops, you can have the 
mortar separate its contents-like powdered bone, 
crushed herbs, pulped organs-i nto separate piles. 
Traverse the Night. If you are holding the pestle 
while you are inside the mortar, you can use your 
action to verbally command the mortar to travel 
to a specific place or creature. You don't need to 
know where your destination is, but it must be a 
specific destination-not just the nearest river or a 
red dragon's lair. If the stated destination is within 
1,000 miles of you, the mortar lifts into the air and 
vanishes. You and any creatures in the mortar travel 
through a dreamlike sky, with hazy reflections of the 
world passing by below. Creatures might see images 
of you streaking through the sky between your point 
of origin and the destination. You arrive at the loca­
tion 1 hour later or, if it is night, 1 minute later. 
Bones Know Their Hom e. When you command 
the mortar to travel, you can instead throw out the 
dust or paste of something ground by the mortar 
and name a location on a different plane of exis­
tence or a different world on the Material Plane.


If that material came from a creature native to the
named plane or world, the mortar travels through 
an empty night sky to an unoccupied space at that 
destination, arriving in 1 minute. 
CHAPTER 3 I MAGICAL MISCEL LANY I2I 
Des troying the Mortar and Pestle. The mortar 
and pestle are destroyed if they are crushed under­
foot by the Dancing Hut of Baba Yaga or by Baba 
Yaga herself.

charges in the following ways while holding it: 
• As a bonus action, you can expend 1 charge to 
detect the presence of aberrations, celestials, 
constructs, elementals, fey, fiends, or undead 
within 60 feet of you. If such creatures are pres­
ent and don't have total cover from you, the bells

can expend a charge to deal an extra 4d6 necrotic 
damage to the target, and you regain a number of 
hit points equal to the necrotic damage dealt. 
• When a creature you can see damages you, you 
can expend a charge and use your reaction to 
make a melee attack against that creature, with 
advantag e on your attack roll.


BLOODWELL VIAL
Wondrous item, uncommon (+1), rare (+2), very rare 
(+3) (requires attunement by a sorcerer) 
To attune to this vial, you must place a few drops 
of your blood into it. The vial can't be opened while 
your attunement to it lasts. If your attunement to the 
vial ends, the contained blood turns to ash. You can 
use the vial as a spellcasting focus for your spells 
while wearing or holding it, and you gain a bonus 
to spell attack rolls and to the saving throw DCs of 
your sorcerer spells. The bonus is determined by 
the vial's rarity. 
In addition, when you roll any Hit Dice to recover 
hit points while you are carrying the vial, you can re­
gain 5 sorcery points. This property of the vial can't 
be used again until the next dawn.


CAULDRON OF REBIRTH
Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement by a 
druid or warlock)


This Tiny pot bears relief scenes of heroes on its
cast iron sides. You can use the cauldron as a spell­
casting focus for your druid spells, and it functions 
as a suitable component for the scrying spell. When 
you finish a long rest, you can use the cauldron to 
create a potion of greater healing. The potion lasts 
for 24 hours, then loses its magic if not consumed. 
As an action, you can cause the cauldron to grow 
large enough for a Medium creature to crouch 
within. You can revert the cauldron to its normal 
size as an action, harmlessly shunting anything that 
can't fit inside to the nearest unoccupied space.


If you place the corpse of a humanoid into the
cauldron and cover the corpse with 200 pounds of


CAULDRON OF REBIRTH
salt (which costs 10 gp) for at least 8 hours, the salt 
is consumed and the creature returns to life as if by 
raise dead at the next dawn. Once used, this prop­
erty can't be used again for 7 days.


COILING GRASP TATTOO
Wondrous item (tattoo), uncommon (requires

Produced by a special needle, this magic tattoo has 
long intertwining designs. 
Tattoo Attunement. To attune to this item, you 
hold the needle to your skin where you want the tat­
too to appear, pressing the needle there throughout 
the attunement process. When the attunement is 
complete, the needle turns into the ink that becomes 
the tattoo, which appears on the skin. 
If your attunement to the tattoo ends, the tattoo 
vanishes, and the needle reappears in your space. 
Grasping Tendrils. While the tattoo is on your 
skin, you can, as an action, cause the tattoo to ex­
trude into inky tendrils, which reach for a creature 
you can see within 15 feet of you. The creature must 
succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or take 
3d6 force damage and be grappled by you. As an 
action, the creature can escape the grapple by suc­
ceeding on a DC 14 Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. The grapple also ends if you halt 
it (no action required), if the creature is ever more 
than 15 feet away from you, or if you use this tattoo 
on a different creature.


CROOK OF RAO
Wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement ) 
Ages ago, the serene god Rao created a tool to 
shield his fledgling faithful against the evils of the 
Lower Planes. Yet, as eons passed, mortals devel­
oped their own methods of dealing with existential 
threats, and the crook was largely forgotten. In 
recent ages, though, the Crook of Rao was redis­
covered and leveraged against the rising power of 
the Witch Queen Iggwilv (one of the names of the 
wizard Tasha). Although she was defeated, Iggwilv 
managed to damage the crook during the battle, in­
fecting it with an insidious curse-and the potential 
for future victory. In the aftermath, the crook was 
again lost. Occasionally it reappears, but the famed 
artifact is not what it was. Whether or not the arti­
fact's bearers realize its full threat, few risk using 
the Crook of Rao-potentially for the final time. 
Random Pro pertie s. The artifact has the follow­
ing random properties, which you can determine by 
rolling on the tables in the "Artifacts" section of the 
Dungeon Master's Guide: 
• 2 minor beneficial properties

it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its 
charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 
18)from it: aura of life (2 charges), aura of purity (2
charges), banishment (1 charge), beacon of hope (1 
charge), mass cure wounds (3 charges). The crook 
regains ld6 expended charges daily at dawn. 
Absolute Banishment. While you are attuned to 
the crook and holding it, you can spend 10 minutes 
to banish all but the mightiest fiends within 1 mile 
of you. Any fiend with a challenge rating of 19 or 
higher is unaffected. Each banished fiend is sent 
back to its home plane and can't return to the plane 
the Crook of Rao banished it from for 100 years. 
Failing Matrix. Whenever the Crook of Rao's Ab­
solute Banishment property is used, or when its last 
charge is expended, roll on the Extraplanar Rever­
sal table. Any creatures conjured as a result of this 
effect appear in random unoccupied spaces within 
60 feet of you and are not under your control.

lggwilv 's Cur se. When the Crook was last used 
against Iggwilv, the Witch Queen lashed out at the 
artifact, infecting its magical matrix. Over the years, 
this curse has spread within the crook, threatening 
to violently pervert its ancient magic. If this occurs, 
the Crook of Rao, as it is currently known, is de­
stroyed, its magical matrix inverting and exploding 
into a SO-foot-diameter portal. This portal functions 
as a permanent gate spell cast by lggwilv. The gate 
then, once per round on initiative count 20, audibly 
speaks a fiend's name in Iggwilv's voice, doing so 
until the gate calls on every fiend ever banished by 
the Crook of Rao. If the fiend still exists, it is drawn 
through the gate. This process takes eighteen years 
to complete, at the end of which the gate becomes 
a permanent portal to Pazunia, the first layer of 
the Abyss.

tions beyond the multiverse long ago. The Crook

An etched crystal sphere the size of a grapefruit
hums faintly and pulses with irregular flares of 
inner light. While you are touching the crystal, 
you can retrieve and store information and spells 
within the crystal at the same rate as reading and 
writing. When found, the crystal contains the fol­
lowing spells: detect thoughts, intellect fortress,* 
Rary's telepathic bond, sending, telekinesis, Tasha's 
mind whip,* and Tenser's floating disk (spells with 
an asterisk appear in this book). It functions as a

While you are holding the crystal, you can use it 
as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells, and 
you know the mage hand, mind sliver (appears in 
this book), and message can trips if you don't already 
know them. 
The crystal has 3 charges, and it regains ld3 
expended charges daily at dawn. You can use the 
charges in the following ways while holding it: 
• If you spend 1 minute studying the information 
within the crystal, you can expend 1 charge to 
replace one of your prepared wizard spells with a 
different spell in the book. 
• When you cast a wizard spell, you can expend 1 
charge to cast the spell without verbal, somatic, or 
material components of up to 100 gp value.


DEMONOMICON OF lGGWILV
Wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement) 
An expansive treatise documenting the Abyss's in­
finite layers and inhabitants, the Demonomicon of


Jggwilv is the most thorough and blasphemous tome
of demonology in the multiverse. The tome recounts 
both the oldest and most current profanities of the 
Abyss and demons. Demons have attempted to cen­
sor the text, and while sections have been ripped 
from the book's spine, the general chapters remain, 
ever revealing demonic secrets. And the book holds 
more than blasphemies. Caged behind lines of 
script roils a secret piece of the Abyss itself, which 
keeps the book up-to-date, no matter how many 
pages are removed, and it longs to be more than 
mere reference material. 
Random Prop ertie s. The artif act has the follow

use the maximum possible result instead of rolling. 
Ensnarement. While carrying the book, when­
ever you cast the magic circle spell naming only 
fiends, or the planar binding spell targeting a fiend, 
the spell is cast at 9th level, regardless of what level 
spell slot you used, if any. Additional ly, the fiend has 
disadvantage on its saving throw against the spell. 
Contai nment . The first 10 pages of the Demon­
omicon are blank. As an action while holding the 
book, you can target a fiend that you can see that 
is trapped within a magic circle. The fiend must 
succeed on a DC 20 Charisma saving throw with 
disadvantage or become trapped within one of the 
Demonomicon's empty blank pages, which fills 
with writing detailing the trapped creature's widely 
known name and depravities. Once used, this action 
can't be used again until the next dawn. 
When you finish a long rest, if you and the Demo­
nomicon are on the same plane of existence, the 
trapped creature of the highest challenge rating 
within the book can attempt to possess you. You 
must make a DC 20 Charisma saving throw. On a 
failure, you are possessed by the creature, which 
controls you like a puppet. The possessing crea­

book, six different demon lords must each tear out 
a sixth of the book's pages. If this occurs, the pages 
reappear after 24 hours. Before all those hours 
pass, a.nyone who opens the book's remaining bind­
ing is transported to a nascent layer of the Abyss 
that lies hidden within the book. At the heart of this 
deadly, semi-sentient domain lies a long-lost artifact, 
Fraz-Urb'luu's Staff. If the staff is dragged from the 
pocket plane, the tome is reduced to a mundane and 
quite out-of-date copy of the Tome of Zyx, the work 
that served as the foundation for the Demonomi-

LUBA'S TAROKKA OF SOULS
Wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement) 
Not all lingering spirits are tragic souls, lost on their 
way to the hereafter. Some languish as prisoners, 
souls so wicked mortals dare not free them upon an 
unsuspecting afterlife. 
Created by a figure of Vistani legend, Luba's


Tarokka of Souls shaped the destiny of countless
heroes. The prophecies of this deck of cards also 
revealed great evils and guided its creator into the 
path of nefarious forces. Untold times the deck's 
creator, Mother Luba, na rrowly escaped doom, 
spared only by her keen insights. But even for her, 
not all wickedness could be escaped. In the most 
dire cases, Mother Luba managed to ensnare beings 
of pure evil amid the strands of fate, imprisoning 
them within her tarroka deck. There these foul spir­
its dwell still, trapped within a nether-realm hidden 
amid shuffling cards, waiting for fate to turn foul­
as it inevitably will. 
CHAPTER 3 I MA GICAL MISCEL LANY 129


LU BA'S TAROKKA OF SOULS
Like all tarokka decks, the Tarokka of Souls is a 
lavishly illustrated collection of fifty-four cards, com­
prising the fourteen cards of the high deck and forty 
other cards divided into four suits: coins, glyphs, 
stars, and swords. 
Random Prop erties. The artifact has the follow­
ing random properties, which you can determine by 
rolling on the tables in the "Artifacts" section of the 
Dungeon Master's Guide: 
• 2 minor detrimental properties 
• 2 minor beneficial properties 
SpeJJs. While holding the deck, you can use an 
action to cast one of the following spells (save DC 
18) from it: comprehend languages, detect evil and 
good, detect magic, detect poison and disease, locate 
object, or scrying. Once you use the deck to cast a 
spell, you can't cast that spell again from it until the 
next dawn. 
Enduring Vision. While holding the deck, you au­
tomatically succeed on Constitution saving throws 
made to maintain your concentration on divina-
tion spells. 
Twis t of Fate. As an action, you can draw a card 
from the deck and twist the fortune of another crea­
ture you can see within 15 feet of you. Choose one 
of the following effects: 
Weal. The creature has advantage on attack 
rolls, ability checks, and saving throws for the 
next hour. 
130 CHAP TER 3 I MAGICAL MISCEL LANY Woe. The creature has disadvantag e on attack 
rolls, ability checks, and saving throws for the 
next hour. 
The deck can be used in this way twice, and you 
regain all expended uses at the next dawn. 
Pris oners of Fate. Whenever you use the Twist of 
Fate property, there is a chance that one of the souls 
trapped in the deck escapes. Roll dlOO and consult 
the Souls of the Tarokka table. If you roll one of the 
high cards, the soul associated with it escapes. You 
can find its statistics in the Monster Manual. If you 
roll a soul that has already escaped, roll again.

The released soul appears at a random location
within lOdlO miles of you and terrorizes the living. 
Until the released soul is destroyed, it gains the ben­
efit of a weal from the deck's Twist of Fate property, 
and both you and the original target of Twist of Fate 
suffer the effect of woe. 
Shuffling Fate. If you go 7 days without using the 
Twist of Fate property, your attunement to Luba's 
Tarroka of Souls ends, and you can't attune to it 
again until after another creature uses Twist of 
Fate on you. 
Destroying th e Deck. Luba's Tarokka of Souls 
can be destroyed only if all fourteen souls within 
·are released and destroyed. This reveals a fifteenth
soul, a lich, that inhabits the Nether card, which 
appears only when the fourteen souls are defeated. 
If this ancient entity is destroyed, the Nether card 
vanishes and the deck becomes a normal tarokka 
deck, with no special properties, but it includes a 
new card of the DM's design.


MOTHER LUBA AND THE VISTANI
The creator of the Tarokka of Souls, Mother Luba was 
one of the most influential leaders of the Vistani. For 
untold generatio ns, the Vistani have wandered the 
Shadowfell, which includes terrifying demiplanes like 
the vampire-haunted realm of Barovia. These travelers 
have learned many secrets of these domains and en­
countered countless others wandering amid the Shad­
owfell's horrors. Most Vistani bands accept well-inten­
tioned wayfarers from diverse walks and of disparate 
origins, embracing any who seek to find a home amid 
the endless roads and vistas hidden amid the mists. 
A halfling Vistani, Mother Luba led one of the largest 
groups ofVistani in the Shadowfell. She hailed from 
the same world that Count Strahd von Zarovich and 
Madam Eva came from, and she created a community 
of kindness and resilience-ever rare to find in the 
Plane of Shadow. She led her people in welcoming 
strangers, feeding the hungry, and defying the cruel. 
She and Madam Eva were once friends, until Madam 
Eva began bargaining with the creatures of the night. 
"We may wander amid the shadows," Mother Luba 
said. "But we must ever serve as a light to our fellow 
travelers." 
Some years ago, Mother Luba disappeared into the 
mists, leaving behind only the Tarokka of Souls. It is 
said that if you draw the Mists card from it, you can 
hear the whispers of her kind voice.


LYRE OF BUILDING
Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement by a 
bard) 
While holding this lyre, you can cast mending as an 
action. You can also play the lyre as a reaction when 
an object or a structure you can see within 300 feet 
of you takes damage, causing it to be immune to 
that damage and any further damage of the same 
type until the start of your next turn. 
In addition, you can play the lyre as an action to 
cast fabricate, move earth, passwall, or summon 
construct (appears in this book), and that spell can't 
be cast from it again until the next dawn.


MASQUERADE TATTOO
Wondrous item (tattoo), common (requires

Produced by a special needle, this magic tattoo ap­
pears on your body as whatever you desire. 
Tattoo Attunement. To attune to this item, you 
hold the needle to your skin where you want the tat­
too to appear, pressing the needle there throughout 
the attunement process. When the attunement is 
complete, the needle turns into the ink that becomes 
the tattoo, which appears on the skin. 
If your attunement to the tattoo ends, the tattoo 
vanishes, and the needle reappears in your space. Fluid Ink. As a bonus action, you can shape the 
tattoo into any color or pattern and move it to any 
area of your skin. Whatever form it takes, it is al­
ways obviously a tattoo. It can range in size from no 
smaller than a copper piece to an intricate work of 
art that covers all your skin. 
Disguise Self. As an action, you can use the tat­
too to cast the disguise self spell (DC 13 to discern 
the disguise). Once the spell is cast from the tat­
too, it can't be cast from the tattoo again until the 
next dawn. 
MIGHTY SE RVANT OF LEUK-0 
Wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement)


Named for the warlord who infamously employed
it, the Mighty Servant of Leuk-o is a fantastically 
powerfu l, 10-foot-tall machine that turns into an an­
imate construct when piloted. Crafted of a gleaming 
black alloy of unknown origin, the servant is often 
described as a combination of a disproportioned 
dwarf and an oversized beetle. The servant contains 
enough space for 1 ton of cargo and a crew compart­
ment within, from which up to two Medium crea­
tures can control it-and potentially execute a spree 
of unstoppable destruction. 
Tales of the servant's origins involve more con­
jecture than fact, often referring to otherworldly be­
ings, the mysterious Barrier Peaks in Oerth, and the 
supposedly related device known as the Machine 
of Lum the Mad. The best details on the device's 
origins and operation can be found in the Mind of 
Metal, a tome of artificer's secrets that connects the 
device to the traditions of the lost Olman people, 
and which was written by Lum the Mad's several 
times over granddau ghter, Lum the Maestro, while 
she reconstructed the long disassembled Mighty 
Servant of Leuk-o. 
Dangerous Attunement. Two creatures can be 
attuned to the servant at a time. If a third creature 
tries to attune to it, nothing happens.


The servant's controls are accessed by a hatch in
its upper back, which is easily opened while there 
are no creatures attuned to the artifact. 
Attuning to the artifact requires two hours, which 
can be undertaken as part of a long rest, during 
which time you must be inside the servant, interact­
ing with its controls. While crew members are at­
tuning themselves, any creature or structure outside 
and within 50 feet of the servant has a 25 percent 
chance of being accidentally targeted by one of its 
Destructi ve Fist attacks once during the attune­
ment. This process must be undergone every time a 
creature attunes itself to the artifact. 
CHAP TER 3 I MA GICAL MISCEL LANY 131 
M1GHTV SERVANT OF LEUK·O 
Con trolling the Serv ant. While any creatures are 
attuned to the artifact, attuned creatures can open 
the hatch as easily as any other door. Other crea­
tures can open the hatch as an action with a suc­
cessful DC 25 Dexterity check using thieves' tools.


A knock spell cast on the hatch also opens it until
the start of the caster's next turn.


A creature can enter or exit through the hatch by
spending 10 feet of movement. Those inside the ser­
vant have total cover from effects originating outside 
it. The controls within it allow creatures to see out­
side without obstruction. 
While you are inside the servant, you can com­
mand it by using the controls. During your turn (for 
either attuned creature), you can command it in the 
following ways: 
• Open or close the hatch (no action required, 
once per turn) 
• Move the servant up to its speed (no ac­
tion required) 
• As an action, you can command the servant to 
take one of the actions in its stat block or some 
other action. 
• When a creature provokes an opportunity attack 
from the servant, you can use your reaction to 
command the servant to make one Destructive 
Fist attack against that creature. 
132 CHAP TER 3 I MAGICAL MISCE LLA NY While there are no attuned creatures inside the 
servant, it is an inert object. 
Ghost in the Machine. Upon his death, the soul 
of the mighty warlord Leuk-o was drawn into the 
artifact and has become its animating force. The 
servant has been known to attack or move of its own 
accord, particular ly if doing so will cause destruc­
tion. Once every 24 hours, the servant, at the DM's 
discretion, takes one action while uncrewed. 
If the servant loses half of its hit points or more, 
each creature attuned to it must succeed on a DC 20

Immutable Existence. The servant is immune to any spell or 
effect that would alter its form or send it to another plane of 
existence. 
Magic Resistant Construction. The servant has advantage on 
saving throws against spells and other magical effects, and 
spell attacks made against it have disadvantage. 
Rege neration. The servant regains 10 hit points at the start of 
its turn. If it is reduced to 0 hit points, this trait doesn't func· 
tion until an attuned creature spends 24 hours repairing the 
artifact or until the artifact is subjected to lightning damage. 
Standing Leap. The servant's long jump is up to 50 feet and its 
high jump is up to 25 feet, with or without a running start. 
Unusual Nature. The servant doesn't require air, food, 
drink, or sleep.


ACTIONS
Destructive Fist. Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +17 to hit, 
reach 10 ft. or range 120 ft., one target. Hit: 36 (4d12 + 10) 
force damage. If the target is an object, it takes triple damage. 
Crushing Leap. If the servant jumps at least 25 feet as part of 
its movement, it can then use this action to land on its feet in a 
space that contains one or more other creatures. Each of those 
creatures is pushed to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the 
servant and must make a DC 25 Dexterity saving throw. On a 
failed save, a creature takes 26 (4d12) bludgeoning damage and 
is knocked prone. On a successful save, a creature takes half as 
much damage and isn't knocked prone. 
Wisdom saving throw or be charmed for 24 hours. 
While charmed in this way, the creature goes on a 
destructive spree, seeking to destroy structures and 
attack any unattuned creatures within sight of the 
servant, starting with those threatening the arti­
fact-preferably using the servant, if possible. 
Self-Destruct. By inputting a specific series of 
lever pulls and button presses, the servant's two 
crew members can cause it to explode. The self-de­
struct code is not revealed to crew members when 
they attune to the artifact. If the code is discovered 
(the DM determines how), it requires two attuned 
crew members to be inside the servant and spend 
their actions on 3 consecuti ve rounds performing 
the command. Should the crew members begin the 
process of entering the code, though, the servant 
uses its Ghost in the Machine property and turns 
the crew members against each other.


If the crew members successfully implement the
code, at the end of the third round, the servant ex­
plodes. Every creature in a 100-foot-radius sphere 
centered on the servant must make a DC 25 Dex­
terity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature 
takes 87 (25d6) force damage, 87 (25d6) lightning 
damage, and 87 (25d6) thunder damage. On a suc­
cessful save, a creature takes half as much damage. 
Objects and structures in the area take triple dam­
age. Creatures inside the servant are slain instantly 
and leave behind no remains. 
This does not destroy the servant permanently. 
Rather, 2d6 days later, its parts-left arm, left leg, 
right arm, right leg, lower torso, and upper torso­
drop from the sky in random places within 1,000 
miles of the explosion. If brought within 5 feet 
of one another, the pieces reconnect and reform

DllHl VER· N11R 
Wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement ) 
The Teeth of Dahlver-Nar are stories given form. 
They are a collection of teeth, each suggestive of 
wildly different origins and made from various ma­
terials. The collection rests within a leather pouch, 
stitched with images of heroes and whimsical crea­
tures. Where the teeth fall, they bring legends to life. 
Using the Teeth. While you are holding the 
pouch, you can use an action to draw one tooth. 
Roll on the Teeth of Dahlver-Nar table to deter­
mine which tooth you draw, and you can either 
sow the tooth or implant it (both of which are de­
scribed later). 
If you don't sow or implant the tooth, roll a die at 
the end of your turn. On an even number, the tooth 
vanishes, and creatures appear as if you sowed the 
tooth, but they are hostile to you and your allies. On 
an odd number, the tooth replaces one of your teeth 
as if you implanted it (potentially replacing another 
implanted tooth, see below). 
Each tooth can only be used once. Track which 
teeth have been used. If a tooth's result is rolled af­
ter it's been used, you draw the next lowest unused 
tooth on the table. 
CHAPTER 3 I MAGICAL MISCE LLANY 135 
Sowing Teeth. To sow the tooth, you place it on 
the ground in an unoccupied space within your 
reach, or you throw it into an unoccupied space 
within 10 feet of you in a body of water that is at 
least SO feet wide and SO feet long. Upon doing so, 
the tooth burrows into the ground and vanishes, 
leaving no hole behind, or it vanishes into the water.


The creatures noted in the Creatures Summoned
column appear in an unoccupied space as close to 
where the tooth was sown as possible. The crea­
tures are allies to you, speak all languages you 
speak, and linger for 10 minutes before disappear­
ing, unless otherwise noted. tooth vanishes. You can have a maximum number 
of the teeth implanted at one time equal to 1 + your
Constitution modifier (minimum of 2 teeth total). If 
you try to implant more teeth, the newly implanted 
tooth replaces one of the previous teeth, determined 
randoml y. The replaced tooth vanishes, and you lose 
the implanted effect. 
Reco vering Teeth. Once all the teeth have van­
ished, their pouch also vanishes. The pouch with 
all the teeth then appears in a random destination, 
which could be on a different world of the Mate­
rial Plane. 
Des troying the Teeth. Each tooth must be de­
stroyed individually by sowing it in the area where 
the tooth's story originated, with the intention to 
destroy it. When planted in this way, creatures sum­
moned are not friendly to you and do not vanish.


Some of the creatures summoned merely head off in
search of home, while others act as their tales dic­
tate. In either case, the tooth is gone forever. Imp lanting Teeth. To implant the tooth, you place 
it in your mouth, whereupon one of your own teeth 
falls out, and the drawn tooth takes its place, resiz­
ing to fit in your mouth. Once the tooth is implanted, 
you gain the effect noted in the Implanted Effect col­
umn. The tooth can't be removed while you are at­
tuned to the teeth, and you can't voluntarily end your 
attunement to them. If removed after your death, the

DUNGEON MASTER'S TOO LS
HE DUNGEON MASTER EMP LOYS MANY 
tools when preparing and running a D&D 
campaign. As a DM, your tools include 
your imagination, your ability to discern 
what entertains your players, your storytelling acu­
men, your sense of humor, your ability to listen well, 
your facility with the game's rules, and more. This 
chapter adds to your toolbox with guidance and op­
tional rules for a variety of situations. The chapter 
also includes a selection of ready-to-use puzzles, 
which you can drop into any campaign.


The tools herein build on the material in the
Dungeon Master's Guide and the Monster Manual. 
You may use some, all, or none of these tools, and 
feel free to customize how they work. Your group's 
enjoyment is paramount, so make these rules your 
own, aiming to match your group's tastes.

Before making characters or playing the game, the 
DM and players can run a special session-colloqui­
ally called session zero-to establish expectations, 
outline the terms of a social contract, and share 
house rules. Making and sticking to these rules can 
help ensure that the game is a fun experience for 
everyone involved.


Often a session zero includes building characters
together . As the DM, you can help players during 
the character creation process by advising them to 
select options that will serve the adventure or cam­
paign that awaits.


CHAR ACTER AND PARTY CREATION
Each player has options when it comes to choosing 
a character race, class, and background, though you 
may restrict certain options that are deemed unsuit­
able for the campaign. If there are multiple players 
in the group, yo� should encourage them to choose 
different classes so that the adventuring party has 
a range of abilities. It's less important that the party 
include multiple backgrounds, as sometimes it's 
fun to play an all-soldier party or a troupe of adven­
turing entertainers. The backgrounds they choose 
define who their characters were before becoming adventurers and also include roleplaying hooks in 
the form of ideals, bonds, and flaws-things you 
ought to know. For example, if a player chooses 
the criminal background, one of the options for the 
character's bond is, "I'm trying to pay off an old debt 
I owe to a generous benefactor." If that's the charac­
ter's bond, you should work with the player to decide 
who that generous benefactor is and build relevant 
storylines into the larger campaign.


PARTY FORMATION
During session zero, your role is to let the players 
build the characters they want and to help them 
come up with explanations for how their charac­
ters came together to form an adventuring party. It 
can be helpful to assume that the characters know 
each other and have some sort of history together , 
however brief that history might be. Here are some 
questions you can ask the players as they create 
characters to get a sense of the party's relationships: 
• Are any of the characters related to each other? 
• What keeps the characters together as a party? 
• What does each character like most about every 
other member of the adventuring party? 
• Does the group have a patron? See chapter 2, 
"Group Patrons," for patron examples.


If the players are having trouble coming up with a
story for how their characters met, they may choose 
an option from the Party Origin table or let a d6 roll 
choose it for them. You should spend part of session 
zero helping the players flesh out the details. For ex­
ample, if the characters came together to overcome 
a common foe, the identity of this enemy needs to 
be determined. If a funeral gathered the group, the 
identity of the deceased and each character's rela­
tionship to them will need to be fleshed out.

5 A festival bri ngs the characters together. 
6 The characters find themselves trapped together. 
CHAP TER 4 I DUNGEON MA STER'S TOOLS 139 
140 RUNNING A GAME FOR ONE PLAYER


ADM running a game for one player should spend
part of session zero working with that player to 
come up with their character's backstor y, then 
let the player decide if they want the character to 
have a sidekick (see the "Sidekicks" section in 
this chapter).


You might need to help the player run the sidekick
for the first few sessions and should make sure the 
player understands the functions and limitations of 
sidekicks: 
• Sidekicks are stalwart companions who can per­
form tasks both in and out of combat, including 
things such as setting up camp and carrying gear. 
• Ideally, a sidekick's abilities should comple­
ment those of the main character. For exam­
ple, a spellcaster makes a good sidekick for a 
fighter or rogue. 
CHAP TER 4 I DUNGEON MA STE R'S TOOLS SOCIAL CONTRACT 
D&D is first and foremost meant to be a fun-for-all 
experience. If one or more participants aren't hav­
ing fun, the game won't last long. Session zero is 
the perfect time for you and the players to discuss 
the experience they're hoping for, as well as topics, 
themes, and behavior they deem inappropriate. Out 
of this discussion, a social contract begins to form. 
Sometimes a social contract takes shape organi­
cally, but it's good practice to have a direct conver­
sation during session zero to establish boundaries 
and expectations. A typical social contract in a D&D 
group includes implicit or explicit commitments to 
the following points: 
• You will respect the players by running a game 
that is fun, fair, and tailored for them. You will al­
low every player to contribute to the ongoing story 
and give every character moments to shine. When 
a player is talking, you are listening. 
• The players will respect you and the effort it takes 
to create a fun game for everyone. The players will 
allow you to direct the campaign, arbitrate the 
rules, and settle arguments. When you are talking, 
the players are listening. 
• The players will respect one another, listen to one 
another, support one another, and do their utmost 
to preserve the cohesion of the adventuring party. 
• Should you or a player disrespect each other or 
violate the social contract in some other way, the 
group may dismiss that person from the table. 
This social contract covers the basics, but indi-
vidual groups might require additional agreed-upon 
terms to guarantee a fun play experience for all. And 
a social contract typically evolves as a group's mem­
bers learn more about one anoth er.


HARD AND SOFT LIMITS
Once you and the players have acknowledged the 
terms of the game's social contract and agreed to 
uphold them, the conversation can segue into a dis­
cussion about soft and hard limits. There are many 
ways to mediate this discussion, and you might want 
to do some research to find an approach that might 
work well for your group. For purposes of this expla­
nation, these terms are described as follows:


A soft limit is a threshold that one should think
twice about crossing, as it is likely to create genu­
ine anxiety, fear, and discomfort.


A hard limit is a threshold that should never
be crossed. 
Every member of the group has soft and hard lim­
its, and it behooves everyone in the group to know 
what they are. Make sure everyone at the table is 
comfortable with how this discussion takes place.


Players might not want to discuss their limits aloud
around the table, especially if they're new to role­
playing games or haven't spent a lot of time with 
certain other members of the group. One way to 
alleviate such discomfort is to encourage the players 
to share their limits privately with you and allow 
you to present them without attribution to the whole 
group. For example, the players could write their 
limits on index cards for you to read aloud. However 
these limits are presented, it would be useful for you 
or one of the players to compile the limits into one 
list that can be shared with the whole group. Keep 
in mind that any discussion about limits should be 
treated with care-even sharing a person's limits 
can be a very painful experience, and this conversa­
tion should be handled with respect. 
Common in-game limits include-but are not lim­
ited to-themes or scenes of sex, exploitation, racial 
profiling, slavery, violence toward children and ani­
mals, gratuitous swearing, and intra-party romance. 
Common out-of-game limits include unwanted phys­
ical contact, dice-sharing, dice-throwing, shouting, 
vulgarity, rules lawyering, distracting use of cell 
phones, and generally disrespec tful behavior. The discussion of limits is important because


DMs and players can have phobias or triggers that
others might not be aware of. Any in-game topic or 
theme that makes a member of the gaming group 
feel unsafe or uncomfortable should be avoided. If a 
topic or theme makes one or more players nervous 
but they give you consent to include it in-game, in­
corporating it should be handled with care, and you 
must be ready to veer away from such topics and 
themes quickly.


While session zero is the perfect place to start this
discussion, it might not be the only time limits are 
addressed. Someone might cross a line and need to 
be reminded of a limit, or someone might not think 
to include some of their limits in the initial discus­
sion. Players can also discover new limits as the 
campaign unfolds. Make a plan to check in with the 
group to make sure the list of hard and soft limits 
is up to date, and remind everyone to revisit this list 
often in case it changes.


GAME CUSTO MIZA TION
In addition to shaping the game around the char­
acters in the adventuring party, you should be 
prepared to customize the game to suit the players' 
tastes. The "Know Your Players" section in the in­
troduction of the Dungeon Master's Guide provides 
some guidance for doing so, based on known player 
archetypes. To help identity what types of players 
are in the group, you can ask each player any or all 
of the following questions: 
• Which of the three pillars of adventuring (combat, 
exploration, roleplaying) interest you the most? 
• How much humor do you like in the game? 
• What level of technology do you prefer? 
• Do you enjoy solving in-game puzzles and riddles? 
• Do you like to track experience points, or would 
you rather have your character advance in level 
when I tell you to?


HOUSE RULES
House rules include optional rules, such as those 
presented in chapter 9 of the Dungeon Master's 
Guide, and rules you create. If you plan to use any 
house rules, session zero is a good time to discuss 
those rules with the players and solicit their input. 
House rules are best presented as experiments, 
and time will tell if they're good for your game. If 
you introduce a house rule in session zero that 
turns out to have an adverse effect on people's en­
joyment of the game, you may jettison or revise the 
house rule to create a better gaming experience for 
everyone. Don't feel bad if a house rule doesn't end 
up working as well as you expected it to. Remember: 
the goal is to ensure everyone is having fun.

SIDEKICKS

TA�HA'


This section provides a straightforward way to add
a special NPC-called a sidekick-to the group of 
adventurers. These rules take a creature with a low 
challenge rating and give it levels in one of three 
simple classes: Expert, Spellcaster, or Warrior.


A sidekick can be incorporated into a group at
the party's inception, or a sidekick might join them 
during the campaign. For example, the characters 
might meet a villager, an animal, or another crea­
ture, forge a friendship, and invite the creature to 
join them on their adventures. 
You can also use these rules to customize a mon­
ster for your own use as DM.


CREA TING A SIDEKICK
A sidekick can be any type of creature with a stat 
block in the Monster Manual or another D&D book, 
but the challenge rating in its stat block must be 1/2 
or lower. You take that stat block and add to it, as ex­
plained in the "Gaining a Sidekick Class" section. 
To join the adventurers, the sidekick must be the 
friend of at least one of them. This friendship might 
be connected to a character's backstory or to events 
that have transpired in play. For example, a sidekick 
could be a childhood friend or pet, or it might be a 
creature the adventurers saved. As DM, you deter­
mine whether there is sufficient trust established for 
the creature to join the group. 
You decide who plays the sidekick. Here are 
some options: 
• A player plays the sidekick as their second charac­
ter-ideal when you have only one or two players. 
• A player plays the sidekick as their only char­
acter-ideal for a player who wants a character 
who's simpler than a typical player character. 
• The players jointly play the sidekick. 
• You play the sidekick.


There's no limit on the number of sidekicks in a
group, but having more than one per player charac­
ter can noticeably slow down the game. And when 
estimating the difficulty of an upcoming encounter, 
count each sidekick as a character.


GAINING A SID EKICK CLASS
When you create a sidekick, you choose the class 
it will have for the rest of its career: Expert, Spell­
caster, or Warrior, each of which is detailed below. 
If a sidekick class contains a choice, you may make 
the choice or let the players make it. 
142 CHAP TER 4 I DUN GEON MA STER'S TOOLS STARTING LEVEL


The starting level of a sidekick is the same as the
average level of the group. For example, if a 1st-level 
group starts out with a sidekick, that sidekick is also 
1st level, but if a 10th-level group invites a sidekick 
to join them, that sidekick starts at 10th level.


LEVELING UP A SIDEKICK
Whenever a group's average level goes up, the side­
kick gains a level. It doesn't matter how much of the 
group's recent adventures the sidekick experienced; 
the sidekick levels up because of a combination 
of the adventures it shared with the group and its 
own training.


HIT POINTS
Whenever the sidekick gains a level, it gains one Hit 
Die, and its hit point maximum increases. To deter­
mine the amount of the increase, roll the Hit Die 
(the type of die appears in the sidekick's stat block), 
and add its Constitution modifier. It gains a mini­
mum of 1 hit point per level. 
If the sidekick drops to 0 hit points and isn't killed 
outright, it falls unconscious and subsequently 
makes death saving throws, just like a player 
character.


PROFICIENCY BONUS
The sidekick's proficiency bonus is determined by 
its level in its class, as shown in the class's table. 
Whenever the sidekick's proficiency bonus in­
creases by 1, add 1 to the to-hit modifier of all the 
attacks in its stat block, and increase the DCs in its 
stat block by 1.


ABILITY SCORE INC REASES
Whenever the sidekick gains the Ability Score Im­
provement feature, adjust anything in its stat block 
that relies on an ability modifier that you increase. 
For example, if the sidekick has an attack that uses 
its Strength modifier, increase the attack's mod­
ifiers to hit and damage if the Strength modifier 
increases.


If it's unclear whether a melee attack in the stat
block uses Strength or Dexterity, the attack can 
use either.


EXP ERT
The Expert is a master of certain tasks or knowl­
edge, favoring cunning over brawn. It might be a 
scout, a musician, a librarian, a clever street kid, a 
wily merchant, or a burglar. 
To gain the Expert class, a creature must have at 
least one language in its stat block that it can speak.


A sidekick gains the following class features as it
gains levels, as summarized on the Expert table. 
•


BONUS PROFICIENCIES
1st-level Expert feature


The sidekick gains proficiency in one saving throw
of your choice: Dexterity, Intelligence, or Charisma. 
In addition, the sidekick gains proficiency in five 
skills of your choice, and it gains proficiency with 
light armor. If it is a humanoid or has a simple or 
martial weapon in its stat block, it also gains profi­
ciency with all simple weapons and with two tools of 
your choice.


HELPFUL
1st-level Expert feature 
The sidekick is adept at giving well-timed assis­
tance; the sidekick can take the Help action as a 
bonus action.


CUNNIN G ACTION
2nd-level Expert feature


The sidekick's agility or quick thinking allows it to
act speedily. On its turn in combat, it can take the 
Dash, Disengage, or Hide action as a bonus action.


EXPERTISE
3rd-level Expert feature 
Choose two of the sidekick's skill proficiencies.


The sidekick's proficien cy bonus is doubled for any
ability check it makes that uses any of the chosen 
proficiencies. [)(PERTS, LEFT TO RIGHT: A TORTLE,

ABILITY SCORE IMPROVEMENT
4th-level Expert feature 
At 4th level and again at 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, and 
19th level, the sidekick increases one ability score of 
your choice by 2, or the sidekick increases two abil­
ity scores of your choice by 1. The sidekick can't in­
crease an ability score above 20 using this feature.


COORDINATED STRIKE
6th-level Expert feature


The sidekick is adept at fighting in concert with a
companion. When the sidekick uses its Helpful fea­
ture to aid an ally in attacking a creature, that target 
can be up to 30 feet away from the sidekick, and the 
sidekick can deal an extra 2d6 damage to it the next 
time the sidekick hits it with an attack roll before 
the end of the current turn. The extra damage is the 
same type of damage dealt by the attack.


EVASION
7th-level Expert feature 
Because of extraordinary good luck, the sidekick 
is skilled at avoiding danger. When the sidekick 
is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a 
Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, it 
instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving 
throw, and only half damage if it failed. The sidekick 
doesn't benefit from this feature while incapacitated.


INSPIRING HELP
11th-level Expert feature 
When the sidekick takes the Help action, the crea­
ture who receives the help also gains a ld6 bonus to 
the d20 roll. If that roll is an attack roll, the creature 
can forgo adding the bonus to it, and then if the 
attack hits, the creature can add the bonus to the 
attack's damage roll against one target. 
At 20th level, the bonus increases to 2d6.


RELIABLE TALENT
14th-level Expert feature


The sidekick has refined its skills to an exceptional
degree. Whenever the sidekick makes an ability 
check that includes its whole proficiency bonus, it 
can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.


SHARP MIND
18th-level Expert feature 
The sidekick gains proficiency in one of the follow­
ing saving throws of your choice: Intelligence, Wis­
dom, or Charisma. 
CHAPTER 4 I DUNGEON MASTER'S TOOLS SPELLCASTER


A sidekick who becomes a Spellcaster walks the
paths of magic. The sidekick might be a hedge wiz­
ard, a priest, a soothsayer, a magical performer, or a 
person with magic in their veins. 
To gain the Spellcaster class, a creature must 
have at least one language in its stat block that it 
can speak.


A sidekick gains the following class features as
it gains levels in this class, as summarized on the 
Spellcaster table.


BONUS PROFICIENCIES
1st-level Spellcaster feature


The sidekick gains proficiency in one saving throw
of your choice: Wisdom, Intelligence, or Charisma. 
In addition, the sidekick gains proficiency in two 
skills of your choice from the following list: Arcana, 
History, Insight, Investigation, Medicine, Perfor­
mance, Persuasion, and Religion. 
The sidekick gains proficiency with light armor, 
and if it is a humanoid or has a simple or martial 
weapon in its stat block, it also gains proficiency 
with all simple weapons.


SPELLCASTING
1st-level Spellcaster feature 
The sidekick gains the ability to cast spells. (If the 
creature already has the Spellcasting trait, this fea­
ture replaces that trait.) Choose the Spellcaster's 
role: Mage, Healer, or Prodigy. This choice deter­
mines the spell list and spellcasting ability used by 
the sidekick, as shown on the Spellcasting table.

Spell Slots. The Spellcaster table shows how 
many spell slots the sidekick has to cast its Spell­

these spells, the sidekick must expend a slot of the 
spell's level or higher. The sidekick regains all ex­
pended spell slots when it finishes a long rest.

learns more spells of your choice. Each of the spells 
in the Spells Known column must be of a level for 
which the sidekick has spell slots, as shown on the 
table. For instance, when the sidekick reaches 5th 
level in this class, it can learn one new spell of 1st or 
2nd level. 
Additional ly, when the sidekick gains a level in 
this class, you can choose one of the spells it knows 
from this class and replace it with another spell 
from its spell list. The new spell must be a cantrip 
or of a level for which the sidekick has spell slots. 
Spellc asting Abi lity. The sidekick's spellcasting 
ability for these spells depends on the choice you 
made on the Spellcasting table.


The sidekick uses its spellcasting ability whenever
a spell refers to that ability. In addition, it uses its 
spellcasting ability modifier when setting the saving 
throw DC for a spell it casts and when making an 
attack roll with one. 
Spell save DC= 8 + sidekick's proficiency bonus+ 
spellcasting ability modifier 
Spell attack modifier= sidekick's proficiency bonus+ 
spellcasting ability modifier 
Spellc asting Focus. The sidekick can use a focus 
for its spells depending on the choice you made on 
the Spellcasting table. A Mage can use an arcane 
focus, a Priest can use a holy symbol, and a Prodigy 
can use an arcane focus or a musical instrument.


ABILITY SCORE IMPROVEMENT
4th-level Spellcaster feature 
At 4th level and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 18th 
level, the sidekick increases one ability score of your 
choice by 2, or the sidekick increases two ability 
scores of your choice by 1. The sidekick can't in­
crease an ability score above 20 using this feature.


POTENT CANTRIPS
6th-level Spellcaster feature


The sidekick can add its spellcasting ability modifier
to the damage it deals with any cantrip.


EMPOWERED SPELLS
14th-level Spellcaster feature 
Choose one school of magic. Whenever the sidekick 
casts a spell of that school by expending a spell slot, 
the sidekick can add its spellcasting ability modifier 
to the spell's damage roll or healing roll, if any.


FOCUSED CASTING
20th-level Spellcaster feature 
Taking damage can't break the sidekick's concentra­
tion on a spell.

J TASHA
Meeting a monster doesn't have to spark a fight. An 
offering, like food, can calm some hostile monsters, 
and sapient creatures often prefer to talk than to 
draw weapons. If the adventurers try to parley with 
a monster, you may improvise the encounter or use 
the social interaction rules in the Dungeon Master's 
Guide. Consider granting the characters advantage 
on any ability check they make to communi cate 
with a creature if they offer something it wants. The 
"Monsters' Desires" section below suggest things 
that a creature might like, depending on its type.


MONSTER RESEARCH
Adventurers can research what a creature is likely 
to desire. The Monster Research table suggests 
which skills can be used to learn about a creature of 
a particular type. The DC for a relevant ability check 
equals 10 + the creature's challenge rating.

TA�HA 
This section explores how to add fantastical chal­
lenges to any locale and ways to further bring an 
adventure's setting to life.


When a creature's name appears in bold in a table
herein, that indicates that you can find the creature's 
stat block in the Monster Manual.


SUPERN ATU RAL REGIONS
Not all lands thrive as nature intended. Magical 
forces, strange interlopers, or tragic events can alter 
an area's destiny, fundamentally changing the land. 
While the flora, fauna, structures, and inhabitants 
might remain unaffected, the land's innate character 
takes on new qualities. 
A supernatural region is permeated by a preter­
natural force in an area as large or small as you 
wish. In the affected area, certain effects and brief 
encounters reinf orce an underlying theme. These 
effects occur as characters traverse an influenced 
region or add interest to a specific affected location.


The descriptions of the following supernatural
regions summarize the region, present a table of 
potential effects within the affected area, and note 
triggers for a random effect. Feel free to customize 
the effects of each region to suit any adventure. 
The effects of a region occur whenever you please, 
at the time each description suggests, or under one 
or more of the following circumstances:


Soon after the party first enters the region
• When a creature loses more than half its 
hit points 
• When a creature casts a spell of 1st level or higher 
• When a creature activates a magic item 
• When a creature makes an exceptionally loud 
noise or otherwise attracts attention 
When the party spends at least 30 minutes in the 
same region


BLESSED RADIANCE
The grace of the Upper Planes touches this region.


Consider rolling on the Blessed Radiance Effects
table when the following circumstances occur in 
the region: 
150 CHAP TER 4 I DUNG EON MAS TER'S TOOLS • A creature succeeds on a saving throw compelled 
by the abilities of a fiend or an undead 
• A creature is the target of a cleric or paladin spell

• A creature experiences an epiphany or inspiring

divine favor spell for l hour. 
07-12 Radiant energy erupts in a 10-foot-radius 
sphere centered on one random creature in 
the region. Each creature in the sphere that 
isn't undead regains 3d6 hit points. Each un­
dead creature in the sphere takes 3d6 radiant 
damage. 
13-18 Aberrations, fiends, and undead in the region 
have disadvantage on attack rolls and ability 
checks for the next 24 hours. 
19-24 Each creature carrying the holy symbol of a 
deity from a non-evil plane while in the region 
gains advantage on saving throws for the next 
24 hours. 
25-30 One character in the region is suffused with 
celestial power. For l minute, the character's 
melee attacks deal an extra 2d6 radiant dam­
age on a hit. 
31-36 One simple or martial weapon that is nonmag­
ical and carried by one character in the region 
gains the properties of a mace of disruption for 
24 hours. 
37-42 A flying, gleaming sword (use the flying sword 
stat block in the Monster Manual) appears 
within 60 feet of an aberration, a fiend, or an 
undead, which becomes the sword's target.


The sword deals radiant damage instead of
slashing damage and knows the exact location 
of its target while the target is within the re­
gion. The sword vanishes when i.t or its target 
is reduced to 0 hit points. 
43-48 One character in the region hears whispers 
from celestial beings or refrains of celestial 
choirs. The character can ask those voices one 
question as if using the commune spell. 
49-54 Aberrations, fiends, and undead in the region 
give off a crimson glow for 1 minute. The crea­
tures shed dim light in a 10-foot radius, attacks 
against them have advantage if the attacker can 
see them, and the creatures can't benefit from 
being invisible. 
55-60 Celestial power explodes in a 30-foot-radius 
sphere of divine light centered on an aberra­
tion, a fiend, or an undead creature within the 
region. Each creature in the sphere must make 
a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a fail­
ure, the creature takes 4d6 radiant damage and 
is blinded. On a success, it takes half damage 
and isn't blinded. 
61-66 One character in the region feels a profound 
sense of purpose and gains the benefit of the 
bless spell for 1 minute. They can choose two 
other creatures they can see to gain the spell's 
benefits as well. 
67-72 A booming voice thunders in Celestial and can 
be heard throughout the region. Each creature 
in the region must make a DC 15 Constitution 
saving throw. On a success, the creature gains 
2dl0 temporary hit points. On a failure, the 
creature is deafened for 1 minute. 73-78 One character in the region gains the ability to 
cure afflictions for 1 hour. As an action, they 
can cast lesser restoration or greater restoration 
without exp ending a spell slot and requiring no 
material components. 
79-84 The effects of a hallow spell (save DC 17). with 
one of its extra effects (DM's choice), settle 
over the region for 24 hours. 
85-90 An angelic voice rings throughout the region. 
Each creature there must succeed on a DC 15


Wisdom saving throw or perform the grovel
option of the command spell. 
91-95 One character in the region permanently gains 
resistance to necrotic damage. Reroll if you've 
already rolled this effect. 
96-00 One character in the region gains the ability 
to use the Divine Intervention cleric feature, 
which succeeds automatical ly. The character 
can use the feature granted in this way only 
once and must use it within 7 days. Reroll if

FAR REALM
As souls travel away from the Material Plane after 
death, they either dwell in the Astral Plane as spir­
its or are pulled toward one of the Outer Planes to 
continue their journey. But some entities find ways 
to travel beyond the Outer Planes to dwell in the 
Far Realm. There they transform over eons into 
abominations or elder evils, seething in a reality 
with its own laws. All who stay in the Far Realm are 
eventually twisted into alien shapes by the realm's 
eldritch forces.


The Far Realm's pernicious influence is often
subtle, leaking into the Material Plane through thin 
places in reality or as invasive thoughts that inspire 
life to propagate along alien paths.


Consider rolling on the Far Realm Effects table
when the following circumstances occur in a region 
touched by the Far Realm: 
• A warlock whose Otherworldly Patron is a Great 
Old One rolls a 1 or 20 on the d20 for an ability 
check, an attack roll, or a saving throw. 
• The characters take a short or long rest in 
the region. 
• A creature spends more than an hour reading an 
eldritch tome written by those who have seen or 
otherwise interacted with the Far Realm.


FAR REALM EFFECTS
dlOO Effect 
01-09 A structure in the region whispers faintly. Any 
creature within 60 feet of the structure that 
can hear it must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom 
saving th row or be charmed. While charmed 
in this way, the creature must move toward 
the source of the whispering, avoiding obvious 
hazards. When it reaches the source, it is inca­
pacitated. The creature can repeat the saving 
throw when it takes damage and at the end 
of every hour, ending the effect on itself on a 
success. 
10-18 An elder evil turns its attention to the region, 
imposing the pressure of its unfathomable 
presence upon the place. Any creature that 
finishes a rest in the region must succeed on 
a DC 12 Charisma saving throw, or it gains no 
benefit from finishing the rest. It instead finds 
strange scrawls, stacked st ones, or its belong­
ings arranged in intricate, abstruse patterns 
nearby. 
152 CHAP TER 4 I DUNGEON MAS TER'S TOOLSdlOO Effect 
19-27 Local plants and animals share a malevolent in­
telligence. Roll a d6. On a l-2, an insect plague 
spell is centered on one random creature in the 
region. On a 3-4, ld4 swarms of ravens and 
ld4 swarms ofrats gather and attack any other 
creatures in the region. On a 5-6, a treant (in 
forested terrain) or a galeb duhr (in rockier ter­
rain) attacks. 
28-36 Distance no longer functions in a comprehen­
sible manner within the region. Creatures make 
ranged attack rolls with disadvantage, and the 
range of those attacks is halved. 
37-45 The landscape melts into a mass of writhing 
flesh, eyes, and fanged mouths. From an unoc­
cupied space in the fleshy ground arise ld4 + 5 
gibbering mouthers that attack anyone in sight. 
46-54 Unintelligible murmurings threaten to over­
come the mind of one random creature within 
the region. At the start of the creature's turn, 
it must succeed on a DC l3 Intelligence saving 
throw or use its action to make one melee at­
tack against the nearest creature it can see. If 
there are no other creatures within reach, the 
target spends its action bab bling. 
55-63 Bizarre appendages squirm beneath the 
ground and around trees or other structures 
within this region. Dozens of limbs burst forth, 
entangling anyone within a 30-foot sphere 
surrounding one random creature. Each crea­
ture in the sphere must succeed on a DC 14 
Dexterity saving throw or take 3d6 bludgeoning 
damage and be restrained. Any creature that 
ends its turn in the area takes 3d6 bludgeoning 
damage. A creature can free itself or someone 
else within reach from being restrained in this 
way by using an action to make a successful DC 
14 Strength or Dexterity check (its choice). 
64-72 Creatures in the region can't leave it and find 
themselves covering the same ground over and 
over. By the time they realize this, 2dl0 hour s 
have passed, during which they have made no 
progress in their effort to leave. The effect then 
ends, and each creature must succeed on a DC 
10 Constitution saving throw or gain l level of 
exhaustion. 
dlOO Effect 
73-79 One random creature in the region hears 
strange whispers and must succeed on a DC 
14 Wisdom saving throw or become charmed. 
While charmed in this way, the creature focuses 
on copying the blasphemous designs that ap­
pear in its mind using whatever medium it has 
available (ink, charcoal, mud, or its own blood). 
Unless restrained, the creature completes the 
designs in l hour of work. When the creature 
finishes its work, it is no longer charmed, and 
a death slaad appears within 30 feet of it and 
attacks anyone in sight. 
80-85 Natural features and structures in this region 
writhe to spell out words and form strange 
symbols. Any creature that tries to read the 
messa_ges must make a DC 20 Intelligence (Ar­
cana) check. On a success, the creature gains 
insight as if it had cast the contact other plane 
spell. On a failure, the creature is affected as 
if it failed a saving throw against the confusion 
spell. This effect ends at the end of the crea­
ture's next turn. dlOO Effect 
86-90 In this region, circular things (such as buttons, 
crystal balls, the sun, and so on) seem appall­
ingly wrong. One random creature that starts 
its turn in this region must succeed on a DC 14


Intelligence saving th row or spend their turn
loudly trying to destroy these objects. 
91-95 Glaring eyes, which weep viscid tears, appear 
on inanimate objects throughout the region.
These eyes watch the characters, and creatures 
within the region can't be surprised by the 
characters for as long as the eyes exist. An eye 
closes and disappear s if it takes any damage. 
Re roll if you've already rolled this effect. 
96-00 A tear in reality creates a rift in the region, simi­
lar to the spell gate, that passes through the Far 
Realm and connects with a random plane. Any 
creature that enters the rift takes lOdlO psychic 
damage from the horrors of the Far Realm and 
appears in an empty space closest to the rift's 
opening on another random plane. The rift 
vanishes after 2dl0 + 2 hours.

HAUNTED
Haunted environs include homes burdened by dark 
deeds, the sites of mass killings, and locations 
where individuals died while experiencing powerful 
fear, sorrow, or hatred. Haunted places bear echoes 
of the past and, like ghosts, harass visitors even as 
they seek respite from age-old traumas. Few places 
are meaninglessly haunted, and you can easily cus­
tomize the general results on the following table to 
suit all manner of macabre tales. 
Consider rolling on the Haunted Effects ta­
ble when the following circumstances occur in 
the region: 
• A creature gains the frightened condition. 
• Multiple creatures are unable to see. 
• A creature is alone. 
• Midnight or another ominous hour arrives. 
• A ghost or other creature tied to the region's grim 
history menaces the party.


HAUNTED EFFECTS
dlOO Effect 
01-05 A violent thunderstorm begins, centered over 
the region. It doesn't end until the party leaves 
the region. 
06-10 A random building in the region gains the ben­
efits of the guards and wards spell (save DC 13) 
for the next 24 hours. 
11-15 A mundane part of one random character's 
surroundings-perhaps a tree bole or a taxi­
dermied animal head-a nimates for 1 minute 
and whispers a warning or threatens to reveal 
one of the character's secrets. 
16-20 All bright light weakens to dim light for 24 
hours. Sources that provide dim light, such as 
candles, do not shed any light. 
21-25 The temperature in the region drops by 10 
degrees Fahrenheit every hour for the next ld6 
hours, after which the temperature returns to 
normal. If cold enough, ice crystals form in sin­
ister patterns. 
26-30 One random creature's shadow acts inde­
pendently for the next 24 hours. The shadow 
acts out of sync with its owner, perhaps dra­
matically choking or trying to murder another 
shadow. 
154 CHAP TER 4 I DUN GEON MA STER'S TOOLS dlOO Effect 
31-35 After the next sunset, the sun doesn' t rise 
again for 36 hours. During this time, the sky 
over the region might hold a crimson moon, 
be obscured by roiling fog, or display blinking, 
alien stars. 
36-40 During the next night, one random sleeping 
creature vanishes and reappears approximately 
a foot beneath where they were sleeping -typ­
ically buried in undisturbed dirt or in a space 
beneath floorboards. The creature or some­
one else can free it with a successful DC 13 
Strength (Athletics) check. 
41-45 One random creature in the region is targeted 
by the levitate spell (save DC 15) for l minute. 
46-50 A nonviolent but unsettling ghost-perhaps a 
pet, an accident-prone child, or a dismem bered 
big toe-appears and follows one random 
creature for 24 hours before vanishing. The 
ghost vanishes if reduced to 0 hit points. 
51-55 One player character's appearance changes 
for the next 24 hours to reflect the region's 
haunted history. For example, they might mani­
fest the distinctive facial scar associated with a 
notorious tyrant who died in the region. 
56-60 For the next 24 hours, any humanoid killed in 
the region rapidly decom poses and rises as a 
skeleton ldlO minu tes after dying. 
61-65 Over the next 24 hours, whenever any creature 
is wounded, its blood (or similar fluid) spreads 
to form a short message or grisly tableau. 
66-70 A spirit inhabits one character's simple or mar­
tial weapon, making it a sentient magic item 
until the character leaves the region. Randomly 
generate the item's properties as described in 
the "Sentient Magic Items" section of the Dun­
geon Master's Guide. 
71-75 A spectral force manifests to one character in 
the region, allowing them to ask one question 
and receive a short answer as through the au­
gury spell. The force manifests as a planchette 
moving on a talking board, writing on foggy 
glass, or insects swarming to create messages. 
76-80 During the next night, one sleeping character 
in the region receives a vision as if the target 
of the dream spell. The dream is brief and 
unsettling, revealing some element of the envi­
ronment's history and putting the character in 
the place of someone who suffered a grim fate 
there. 
dlOO Effect 
81-85 A coffin or small enclosed space in the re­
gion-perhaps an antique box, stone cairn, or 
tree stump sealed with rocks-radiates palpa­
ble malice. The first time a creature opens it, 
roll a die. If you roll an even number, the crea­
ture receives a terrible vision and is frightened 
of all creatures for the next 24 hours. If you roll 
an odd number, an avatar of death appears and 
attacks as though summoned by the Skull card 
from a deck of many things. 
86-90 Over the next 24 hours, whenever any creature 
in the region regains hit points from a spell, 
the healing magic leaves scars. This might be 
accompanied by a purging of black bile or a 
spectral force tearing free from the creature.


These scars can be removed only by greater
restoration or wish. dlOO Effect 
91-95 For 24 hours, a luminous wisp of vapor floats 
above a corpse or grave in the region. If the 
wisp is put in a container, a creature holding 
the receptacle can cast the resurrection spell 
once, requiring no compone nts and causing
the wisp to vanish. Any creature returned to life 
in this way experienc es strange dreams. 
96-00 A mysterious mist rises from the shadows.


This dense fog heavily obscur es everything in
a SO-foot-radius sphere around one random 
creature in the region. Any creature that starts 
its turn in the mist must succeed on a DC 10


Constitution saving throw or gain l level of
exhaustion. This exhaustion can't be removed 
while the creature is in the mist. Additional ly, 
creatures notice unsettling sights through 
the fog, such as ominous ruins or soundless 
silhouettes fleeing pursuit. The mists can't be 
dispersed by any wind, but clear after l minute.

INFESTED
On many worlds, the biomass of insects radically 
outweighs that of higher organisms. Mass migra­
tions and deadly insect species can imperil larger 
creatures, but most insects remain nothing more 
than an annoyance. However, through wild popu­
lation booms, magical manipulation, supernatural 
growth, interbreeding with otherworldly species, or 
stranger circumstances, insects can overrun an en­
tire region. Swarms of insects become the dominant 
species in an area, consuming plants and animals, 
creating elaborate hives or tunnels, and infesting 
structures and the earth.


The following effects represent a region overrun
by insects or hives of similar creatures, likely ma­
nipulated by magic, otherworldly intelligence, or 
environmental factors to infest an area in countless 
numbers and drive out all competing life. 
Consider rolling on the Infested Effects ta­
ble when the following circumstances occur in 
the region: 
• Webs, cocoons, hives, anthills, or other insect 
dwellings are disturbed. 
• A creature attacks an insect swarm or a Small or

spider, in the region. 
• A creature begins a short or long rest.

06-10 A mass migration of insects begins, with waves 
of Tiny bugs crawling over everything in the re­
gion. Creatures cannot take a short or long rest 
in the region for the next 24 hours. 
11-15 A swarm ofbioluminescent flies converges on 
one random creature in the region. For the next 
minute, the creature sheds dim light in a 10-
foot radius, any attack against it has advantage 
if the attacker can see it, and the creature can't 
benefit from being invisible. 
16-20 A boil of termites bursts from the ground,

26-30 A cluster of l d4 + 2 faintly glowing grubs ap­
pears in an unoccupied space wi thin 30 feet of 
the party. Any creature that consumes one of 
these succulent grubs receives the benefits of a 
potion of healing. 
31-35 A large, psychedelically colored moth flies over 
the party, dusting the characters with strange

succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw 
or be charmed by all creatures for l hour. 
36-45 The region is choked with wispy webbing, 
which acts as difficult terrain. 
46-50 Nearly every surface is covered with discarded 
cicadae-like shells that crunch loudly when 
trod upon, imposing disadvantage on Dexterity

ceed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or 
contract the sight rot disease (see the Dungeon 
Master's Guide) from minute parasites. 
66-70 Dung-colored bugs cover the ground. Crea­
tures that move at half their normal walking 
speed can ignore the bugs. Those that move 
faster must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution 
saving th row or become poisoned until the 
start of their next turn. A creature poisoned 
in this way has its speed reduced to 0, as it is 
overcome by the squashed insects' foul smell. 
Creatures that don't need to breathe automati­
cally succeed on this saving th row. 
71-75 One of the characters in the region must suc­
ceed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be 
transformed into a giant spider, as if by the

long rest. If the creature has any paper mate­
rial, the silverfish destroy one random book or 
other paper item that isn't magical. 
81-85 One random creature in the region must suc­
ceed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or 
become host to a particularly aggressive tape­
worm. The affected creature gains no benefit 
from eating until it receives treatment that re­
moves a disease. A creature immune to disease 
automatically succeeds on this saving throw. dlOO Infested Effects

next time one random creature in the region 
dons its clothing or armor after finishing a long 
rest, it must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution

MIRROR ZONE
A mirror zone occurs where planar and magical 
energies converge and create a place of reflections. 
Creatures, objects, and energy reflect, refract, dupli­
cate, or are transported elsewhere. Such locations 
arise from the intrusion of a theorized Plane of 
Mirrors upon the Material Plane, or where powerful 
magic governing transition, protection, or divination 
had unexpected results.

• A creature uses any teleportation magic. 
• An illusion appears. 
• A creature impersonates another creature.

checks and ability checks made to disguise 
themselves. 
07-12 The hallucinatory terrain spell (save DC 15) af­
fects the natural terrain of the region, changing 
it into a different kind of terrain (DM's choice). 
13-18 One random creature in the region gains the 
benefits of the blink spell for 1 minute, shim­
mering with overlapping sh attered reflections. 
19-24 Creatures in the region don't cast reflections. 
Wisdom (Insight) checks made against those 
creatures have disadvantage, and the creatures 
have disadvantage on Charisma (P ersuasion) 
checks made against anyone who notices their 
lack of reflect ion. When they leave the region, 
creatures regain their reflections, and the effect 
ends. 
25-34 Reflections of ld4 creatures in the region 
emerge from mirrors and attack. The reflec­
tions are two-dimensional, shimmering ver­
sions of the creatures that cast them. Treat the 
reflections as shadows that are fey instead of 
undead and vulne rable to bludgeoning damage 
instead of radiant.

in the region attract spectral slivers of glass 
that cause extra damage. Any creature, other 
than a construct or an undead, hit by an attack 
that deals piercing or slashing damage begins 
to bleed, losing ld4 hit points at the start of 
each of its turns. If the bleeding creature is hit 
by another such attack, the bleeding increases 
by ld4. Any creature can take an action to 
stanch the wound with a successful DC 10 Wis­
dom (Medicine) check. The bleeding also stops 
if the target receives magical healing. 
47-52 Mirrors and other highly reflective surfaces 
allow magical transport while in the region.


Any creature that touches its reflection in an
object that it isn't wearing or carrying can im­

no components but using a mirror or other 
reflective surface. 
59-64 The skin of one random creature in the region 
becomes silvery and reflective for the next 24 
hours. For the duration, that creature has ad­
vantage on saving throws against spells, and 
spell attacks have disadvantage against that 
creature. 
65-70 A longsword or shortsword with a blade made 
of a jagged mirror appears in an unoccupied 
space within 60 feet of a random creature in 
the region. The weapon is a sword of wounding 
(see the Dungeon Master's Guide). If the weap­
on's wielder rolls a 1 or 20 on an attack roll 
using the weapon, the weapon shatters and is 
destroyed after that attack. 
71-76 For the next 24 hours, when anyone in the 
region hits a creature with an attack roll and 
deals damage to it, the attacker must succeed 
on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw or take force 
damage equal to half the damage dealt.

energy appear in unoccupied spaces in the 
region for 1 minute. Each is 6 feet in diameter 
and floats l foot above the ground. One ap­
pears in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of 
the party. Any creature that moves through the 
disk instantly appears within 5 feet of the other 
disk or the nearest unoccupied space. 
83-88 The next time one character in the party sees 
their reflection in the region, that reflection of 
comes to life and engages its counterpar t in 
conversation. It offers to answer one question 
posed to it as if the creature cast the divination 
spell. After answering the question, the reflec­
tion returns to normal. dlOO Effect 
89-94 Floating shards of broken mirrors swirl through 
the region, showing reflections of creatures 
and places that aren't present, for the next 
minute before vanishing. On initiative count 
20 (losing all ties), the shards make a ranged 
weapon attack (+6 to hit) against one random 
creature in the region. On a hit, the target takes 
10 (3d6) slashing damage. 
95-00 A duplicate of one random creature in the re­
gion appears in an unoccupied space within 
30 feet of that creature. The duplicate's ap­
pearance, game statistics, and equipment are 
identical to the creature's. The duplicate im­
mediately attacks the creature, seeking to slay 
it. If the duplicate dies, it and all its equipment 
shatter into mirror shards. If the duplicate fails 
to slay the creature within l hour, the duplicate 
vanishes.

by the mind blank spell for the next 24 hours. 
160 CHAP TER 4 I DUNGEON MASTER'S TOOLS dlOO Effect 
13-18 For l minute on initiative count 20 (losing all 
ties), Tiny and Small objects in the region that 
aren't being worn or carried are flung by an 
unseen force. One random creature in the re­
gion must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving 
throw or take 2d4 bludg eoning damage from 
the flung objects. 
19-24 Memories become sharp and clear for l hour. 
During this time, each creature in the region 
adds double its proficiency bonus to Intelli­
gence checks made to recall information. 
25-34 Headaches and nosebleeds plague humanoids 
in the region, imposing disadvantage on Wis­
dom (Perception) checks for l hour. 
35-40 Psychic power builds in the mind of one ran­
dom creature in the region. Once within the 
next minute, the creature can use a bonus 
action to magically assault the mind of another 
creature it can see. The target must succeed on 
a DC 14 Intelligence saving throw or take 4dl0 
psychic damage. 
dlOO Effect 
41-46 Lurking fears become nightmares. Any creature 
that finishes a short or long rest in the region 
must succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom saving 
throw or gain no benefit for finishing the rest. 
47-52 For l hour, each creature in the region gains 
the ability to communicate telepathically with 
any creature it can see within 60 feet. If the tar­
get understands any languages, it can respond 
telepathical ly. 
53-58 One random creature in the region can sense 
the presence of nearby minds for l hour. For 
the duration, the creature gains advantage on 
Wisdom (Perception) checks made to locate 
other creatures within 120 feet of it, even crea­
tures behind total cover. 
59-64 Creatures in the region suffer from disjointed 
thoughts and difficulty concentra ting for l 
hour. For the duration, creatures have disad­
vantage on Intelligence checks and Constitu­
tion saving throws to maintain concentration 
on spells. 
65-70 One random creature in the region hears 
strange whispers in its mind. The whispers are 
fragments of thoughts from other creatures 
nearby. The creature has advantage on Wisdom 
(Insight) checks for l hour. 
71-76 One random creature in the region gains the 
ability to cast the telekinesis spell (save DC 15) 
once over the next 24 hours, requiring no com­
ponents. Intelligence is the spellcasting ability 
for this spell. 
77-82 Thoughts in the region attract ambient psychic 
energy, forming protective fields around crea­
tures' minds. Creatures in the region gain resis­
tance to psychic damage for the next hour. 
83-88 For l minute on initiative count 20 (losing all 
ties), one random creature in the region must 
succeed on a DC l 5 Intelligence saving throw 
or take 2d6 psychic damage. 
89-94 Compassion and joy fill the mind of one ran­
dom creature in the region for l minute. For 
the duration, the creature has advantage on 
Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving 
throws, and disadvantage on attack rolls. 
95-00 The mind of every beast in the region is 
flooded with psychic ener gy. This energy 
causes each beast's Intelligence score to be­
come l 0, if it wasn't already higher, and the 
beast gains the ability to speak Common and 
Sylvan fluently. These changes are permanent. AWAKEN ANYT HIN G


Legends are filled with natural forces and mundane
objects that take on humanoid cha racteristics to guide 
or confound her oes: statues that sing, animals that 
whisper secrets, clouds that speak their mind. While 
monsters like elementals, galeb duhr, and treants rep­
resent natural forces brought to life, not every chatty 
rock or sagacious stream needs a stat block. Perhaps 
your adventures take a party to a land where plants 
speak freely or a cursed realm where petrified souls 
beg for help. Don't feel restricted by the options in the


Monster Manual or by the limitations of the animate
object spell should you want to breathe extra life into 
your story. Filling a witch's redoubt with murmuring 
relics, a fey forest with eavesdropping vegetation, or 
a sky god's temple with avian choirs makes a place 
especially memorable. Spells such as animate object, 
awaken, speak with animals, speak with plants, and the 
like provide guidance on how to bring commonplace 
creatures and objects to life.


UNRAVELING MAGIC
The source of magic is damaged or corrupted in this 
region. Magic is unpredictable, and strange results 
occur when a creature casts a spell. Such regions 
come into being when potent rituals go awry (or if 
they succeed, in the case of dangerous and destruc­
tive undertaking s), in the aftermath of cataclysmic 
magical battles, or where an artifact was destroyed.


Consider rolling on the Unraveling Magic Effects
table when the following circumstances occur in 
the region: 
• Any charges are expended in a magic item. 
• A spell slot of 1st level or higher is expended. 
• A dragon, a fey, or an elemental of challeng e rating 
5 or higher dies.


UNRAVELING MAGIC EFFECTS
dlOO Effect 
01-05 All magic items in the region temporarily lose 
their magical properties, becoming nonmagical 
for l hour. Artifacts are unaffected. When the 
items regain their magic, a creature's attune­
ment to any of them is restored. 
06-10 The region becomes a dead-magic zone for l 
hour. For the duration, the entire region is af­
fected by the anti magic field spell. 
11-15 One random creature in the region must 
succeed on a DC l 5 Dexterity saving throw or 
be enclosed in Otiluke's resilient sphere for l 
minute. 
16-20 One random creature in the region that has ex­
pended spell slots regains one expended spell 
slot of a random level. 
CHAPTER 4 I DUNGEON MASTER'S TOOLS 161 
dlOO Effect 
21-25 Flares of magical energy flash through the re-
gion for 1 minute. For the duration, each round 
on initiative count 20 (losing all ties) one ran-
dom creature in the region takes 2d4 damage 
of a type determined by a d6: 1, acid; 2, cold; 3, 
fire; 4, force; 5, lightning; or 6, thunder . 
26-30 One of the characters in the region must sue-
ceed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be 
transforme d into a blink dog, as if by the poly-
morph spell. The spell lasts for 1 hour or until 
dispelled. 
31-35 One random creature in the region that has 
spell slots expends one spell slot of a ran-
dom level in a harmless shower of sparks and 
sounds. 
36-40 All fire in the region freezes into ice that gives 
off a blue light equal to the illumination it nor-
mally provides. In addition, the region radiates 
extreme cold (see the Dungeon Master's Guide) 
for 1 day. 
162 CHAP TER 4 I DUN GEON MAS TER'S TOOLS dlOO Effect 
41-45 One random creature in the region with spell 
slots becomes a focal point for ambient magic 
for 1 hour. At the end of each of the creature's 
turns, other creatures within 10 feet of it must 
succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against 
the spellcaster's spell save DC or take ld6 force 
damage. 
46-50 The flaming sphere spell (save DC 15) spon-
taneously activates in an unoccupied space 
within 5 feet of the party. On initiative count 20 
(losing all ties), the sphere moves 30 feet to-
ward the nearest creature. The sphere vanishes 
after 1 minute. 
51-55 Simple or martial weapons in the region that 
are nonmagical crackle with power. For 1 hour, 
they become magic weapons that grant a +l 
bonus to attack and damage rolls made with 
them. 
56-60 Swirling energy surrounds one random crea-
ture in the region for 24 hours. For the du-
ration, the creature gains resistance to force 
damage and its speed is reduced by 10 feet. 
dlOO Effect 
61-65 Each character in the region suddenly learns 
some magic. A character learns one wizard 
cantrip of the character's choice and knows the 
cantrip for ld8 days. 
66-70 One random creature in the region crackles 
with sparks of light for l hour. For the duration, 
the creature magically sheds bright light in a 
10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 
l 0 feet. In addition, any creature it touches 
(requiring an unarmed strike if the target is un­
willing) takes ld6 force damage. 
71-75 Lightning arcs in a 5-foot wide line between 
two creatures in the region that are within 30 
feet of each other and not behind total cover. 
Each creature in the line (including the two) 
must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, 
taking 4d6 lightning damage on a failed save or 
half as much damage on a successful one. 
76-80 The reverse gravity spell (save DC 18) activates 
for l minute, centered on the ground beneath 
one random creature in the region. 
81-85 On initiative count 20 (losing all ties), two ran­
dom creatures in the region must each make 
a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. If either save 
fails, the creatures magically teleport, switch­
ing places. If both saves succeed, they don't 
teleport. 
86-90 One random creature in the region breaks 
spells for l hour. Whenever anyone within 20 
feet of the creature casts a spell, the spellcaster 
must succeed on a DC 15 saving throw using 
its spellcasting ability, or the spell drains away 
without effect. The spell slot, charge, or feature 
use that powered the spell is wasted. 
91-95 During the next 24 hours, the first time a crea­
ture in the region targets another creature with 
a spell, the caster must make a DC 11 saving 
throw using its spellcasting ability. On a failed 
save, the spell targets the caster instead. On a 
successful save, the spell functions normally. 
This effect then ends. 
96-00 One random creature in the region can sud­
denly cast the wish spell once, within the next 
minute. Re roll if you've rolled this effect in the 
past 24 hours. MAGICAL PHENOMENA


Magic has the ability to make even the most serene
natural settings unpredictable. Whether the result 
of magical calamities, otherworldly influences, or 
nexuses of inexplicable forces, the subsequent ef­
fects range from whimsical to deadly.


ELDRITCH STORMS
When magical currents become trapped amid 
winds and clouds, eldritch storms can result. 
Flay win d. Supernaturally powerful winds-
like those from planes such as Pandemonium or 
Minethys, the third layer of Carceri-can spawn 
flaywinds. A flaywind is an intense sandstorm, 
gathering large rocks and other debris in addition 
to sand or grit. The area within the storm is heavily 
obscured, and a creature exposed to the storm takes 
ld4 slashing damage at the start of each of its turns.


Only substantial cover or shelter offers protection
against the flensing grit. 
A flaywind leaves 4d6 feet of sand or debris in its 
wake. A successful DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) or 
(Nature) check or Wisdom (Survival) check allows 
a character to recognize a flaywind 1 minute before 
it strikes, allowing time to seek shelter. A flaywind 
typically lasts ld4 x 10 hours. 
Flame Storm. Sooty thunderclouds shot through 
with red and orange lightning release a deluge of 
fiery droplets. Any creature caught in the burning 
rain takes 2d6 fire damage at the start of each of 
its turns. The droplets ignite any flammable objects 
that aren't being worn or carried; otherwise, the 
droplets burn out immediately. The smoke, soot, 
crackle, and low roar of the storm impose disadvan­
tage on Wisdom (Perception) checks and ranged 
attack rolls. 
A flame storm usually lasts 2d4 minutes, though 
the originating storm clouds can persist for days, 
creating multiple flame storms. 
Necrotic Tempest. Storms infused with the es­
sence of death roil with dark clouds that manifest 
leering skulls and bone-white lightning. Any crea­
ture exposed to the storm that isn't a construct or 
an undead must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution 
saving throw at the end of each minute or take 3d6 
necrotic damage.


A creature that dies in a necrotic tempest rises
as a skeleton or zombie (your choice) ldlO min­
utes later. 
A necrotic tempest lasts for ld4 hours and leaves 
crops withered and wells undrinkable for ld4 days 
after its passing. 
Thrym 's Howl. These bone-chilling blizzards 
drive a wall of wind and snow like a living glacier. 
The storm pro jects extreme cold (see the Dungeon 
Master's Guide). Due to the howling wind and 
dense blue-white ice particles, the area in the storm 
CHAPTER 4 I DUNGEON MASTER'S TOOLS 163 
is heavily obscured, and ranged attack rolls and 
Wisdom (Perception) checks made within it have 
disadvantage.


Any creature exposed to the storm at the start of
its turn takes 2d6 cold damage and can't regain hit 
points until it spends at least 1 hour in a warm en­
vironment. A creature that dies in the storm freezes 
solid. Creatures that are immune to cold damage 
are immune to the effects of the storm and can see 
normally within it. 
Thrym's howl typically lasts 2d10 hours.


EMOTIONAL ECHOES
Occasionally a place becomes infused with the pow­
erful emotions of those who once dwelt, worked, 
celebrated, or suffered there. Areas with emotional 
echoes are typically associated with one common 
emotion, such as joy or sorrow. Such an area might 
be as small as a room in a house or as large as a 
forest. Once per day, if a creature within the area 
expresses even the faintest hint of the prevailing 
emotion, the land seeks to hold onto that creature 
and inspire it to produce more of the feeling tied to 
the emotional echo. The creature is targeted by a 
suggestion spell (DC 16), with the intent of making 
it linger in the area and perform an act related to its 
associated emotion. The effect lasts 24 hours. 
164 CHAPTER 4 I DUNGEON MAS TER'S TOOLS The following list notes some of the most common 
emotional echoes, where they tend t.o appear, and 
how they typically influence creatures: 
Boldness: Appears in battlefields and echoing 
canyons, encouraging creatures to shout hidden 
truths and act out their greatest victories 
Doubt: Appears around cliffs or deserts and makes 
creatures hesitate, mistrusting their ability to 
climb or escape their current difficulties 
Fear: Appears in caves and ruins, overwhelming 
creatures with dread and urging them to give 
voice to their deepest fears 
Hatred: Appears in volcanic regions and provokes 
creatures to scream and destroy things 
Inspiration: Appears around memorials or natural 
wonders, causing creatures to create works of art 
on the spot and obsess over them 
Joy: Appears in glens or flowering fields, inspiring 
creatures to dance, relax, and sing 
Love: Appears along beaches or orchards and en­
courages creatures to confess their love to others 
and endlessly list their favorite things 
Sorrow: Appears in ruins and swamps, particula rly 
around quicksand, and overwhelms creatures 
with sobbing and confessions of regret


ENCHANTED SPRINGS
Enchanted springs brim with miraculous waters, 
whether they tap into magical sources hidden be­
neath the earth or they're blessed by eldritch beings.


Those who find these mystical sites might bathe or
drink from the pools and temporarily gain a mea­
sure of the waters' magic. All manner of protectors 
or covetous guardians might lurk around these 
springs, driving off strangers or demanding a wor­
thy price for access to the mystical waters.


While many enchanted springs bear the blessings
of wild gods or fey beings, some are tainted. These 
might be waters that were long ago polluted by the 
ichor of an evil entity. As with pristine enchanted 
springs, folk seek out such defiled places, whether 
to purify them or claim their foul powers. 
Regardless of whether a spring is pure or tainted, 
creatures might need to drink the water to experi­
ence the spring's effects, simply touch the water, or 
bathe in it for a minute to trigger an effect.


Bottling an enchanted spring's water removes its
magical properties, unless the bottle is a specially 
prepared vial blessed by whatever being enchanted 
the spring in the first place. ENCHAN TED SPRING EFFECTS 
dl2 Effect


Any creature that touches or drinks the water of
this spring feels blessed. The creature gains the 
benefits of a bless spell for 1 hour. 
2 Bathing in the spring covers a creature with a glow­
ing coat of golden feathers. While the creature isn't 
wearing armor, the feathers grant a+ 1 bonus to 
AC. The feathers vanish after ld4 days. 
3 A creature that touches or drinks the water of this 
spring develops an overwhelming desire to sing. 
Every sentence the creature speaks for the next 24 
hours rings with lyrical splendor, which grants it 
advantage on all Charisma checks. 
4 Bathing in the spring grants a creature the benefits 
of the greater restoration spell. As a side effect, the 
creature's skin, hair, and eyes become a shimmer­
ing golden color for ld4 days. 
5 Bathing in the spring grants a creature the benefits 
of the spider climb spell for 24 hours. 
6 A creature that touches or drinks the water of this 
spring grows the tail of its favorite animal. The tail 
is not under the creature's control; it moves or re­
acts to emotions. The tail vanishes after 24 hours. 
dl2 Effect 
7 Any creature with an Intelligence score of6 or 
higher that touches or drinks the water of this 
spring gains advantage on Wisdom (Insight) 
checks and c.an cast the detect thoughts spell once, 
requiring no compone nts. The effects of the spring 
fade when either the spell is used or 24 hours 
pass, whichever happens first. 
8 Bathing in the spring causes ldlO flowers to grow 
from a creature's head. The flowers smell lovely, 
and they renew their vitality and scent every day. 
The flowers vanish after 7 days. 
9 A creature that touches or drinks the water of this 
spring grows ld4 eyestalks. These eyestalks let the 
creature see in all directions and grant it advantage 
on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight. 
The eyestalks vanish after ld4 days. 
10 Bathing in the spring causes a creature's voice to 
sound sinister. For the next 24 hours, the crea­
ture's voice grants it advantage on Charisma (In­
timidation) checks and disadvantage on Charisma 
(Deception) and Charisma (P ersuasion) checks. 
11 A creature that touches or drinks the water of this 
spring grows a set of donkey ears. The ears grant 
the creature advantage on Wisdom (Perception) 
checks that rely on hearing. The ears vanish after 
ld4 days. 
12 Bathing in the spring causes a creature to develop 
a third eye on its forehead. The eye grants the 
creature truesight out to a range of 60 feet. The eye 
vanishes after 24 hours. MAGIC MUSHROOMS 
Mushrooms can be deadly, delicious, or both. Some 
have magical properties, especially those that grow 
in areas suffused by mystical energy, such as the 
Underdark and the Feywild. 
Creatures proficient in the Medicine, Nature, or


Survival skills might be versed on the subject of
fungi, especially the magical kind, since the benefi­
cial effects can save lives or bestow unusual powers. 
But when an unknown variety of fungus is encoun­
tered, only an expert can identify it and determine 
its properties. 
To determine the effects of eating such fungus, 
roll on the Magic Mushroom Effects table.


MAGIC MUSHROOM EFFECTS
dlO Effects 
The creature's skin turns an unusual color. Roll 
a d4: 1, purple with yellow splotches; 2, bright 
orange with tiger stripes; 3, tree-frog green with 
red squiggles; 4, hot pink with yellow spots. This 
change is permanent unless removed by a greater 
restoration spell or similar magic. 
2 The creature gains the enlarge or reduce effect 
(50 percent chance of either) of the enlarge/reduce 
spell for 1 hour. 
3 The creature regains Sd8 + 20 hit points. 
4 Vocally, the creature can only cluck and croon like 
5 
6 a chicken. The creature can also understand and 
speak to chickens. This curse lasts for 1 hour un­
less ended by a remove curse spell or similar magic. 
The creature can understand and speak all lan­
guages for 1 d4 days.


The creature gains the benefits of the telepathy
spell for the next 24 hours. 
7 The creature gains the benefits of the speak with 
plants spell for 8 hours. 
8 The creature immediately casts the time stop spell, 
requiring no compone nts. Constitution is the 
spellcasting ability for this spell. 
9 The creature immediately casts the detect thoughts 
spell, requiring no components. Constitution is the 
spellcasting ability for this spell. 
10 Magical mists pour out of the creature's eyes and 
ears, acting as a fog cloud spell for 1 hour that is 
centered on the creature and moves with it.


MIMIC COLONIES
Mimics imitate terrain and dungeon dressing to 
hunt for food. Rare specimens develop a deeper un­
derstanding of the world and can communicate with 
other creatures. In extremely rare cases, groups of 
these creatures band together, creating colonies.


These bonded mimics cooperate to create larger
objects than any lone mimic could approximate. A 
mimic colony can work together to form buildings, 
bridges, crystal formations, cliff faces, statues, and 
nearly anything it desires. Entire villages appearing 
out of nowhere might be composed of mimics! 
Mim ic Communica tion. Members of the colony 
develop telepathy and the ability to speak. While 
within 10 miles of the colony, any mimic can com­
municate telepathically with other creatures within 
120 feet of it and can speak Common and Under­
common fluently (or two other languages of the 
DM's choice). The colony's offspring gain these abil­
ities innately and can use them even away from the 
colony, as shown in the juvenile Mimic stat block. 
Conf ronting a Colon y. A mimic colony's primary 
goal is survival: If threatened by a force the mimics 
can't overcome, they are willing to bargain. Mimic 
colonies have learned that adventurers they can't de­
feat can be bought off with information about nearby 
creatures or locations, hidden treasure (which the 
colony obtained from prior "food"), or even one of 
their own young. JUVE NIL E MIMI C

CHAP TER 4 I DUNGE ON MA STER'S TOOL S 167


If the colony's survival is threatened and it thinks
it has a chance of surviving a fight, it can leverage its 
combined might using special lair actions. On initia­
tive count 20 (losing all ties), the mimic colony takes 
a lair action, causing one of the following effects; it 
can't use the same effect two rounds in a row: 
• The mimic colony chooses up to three creatures 
within 300 feet of it. Each target must succeed on 
a DC 15 Strength saving throw or have its speed 
reduced to 0 until initiative count 20 on the follow­
ing round, as pieces of the environment grasp the 
target. If a target fails the save by 5 or more, it is 
restrained instead for that duration. 
• The mimic colony uses the Help action, aiding a 
creature of its choice within 300 feet of it. 
• The mimic colony chooses up to three creatures 
within 300 feet of it. Each target must succeed on 
a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 13 (3d8) 
acid damage, as orifices appear on surfaces in the 
environment and launch caustic spittle. 
• The mimic colony chooses a cube of nonmagical, 
inanima te material in physical contact with it. The 
cube can be up to 15 feet on a side. The colony re­
shapes that material however it likes. This trans­
formation lasts for 1 hour.


When determining the difficulty of an encounter
with a hostile mimic colony, consider the colony to 
be one additional creature of challeng e rating 2. 
168 CHAPTER 4 I DUNGEON MAS TER'S TOOLS PRIMAL FRUIT 
In wild places brimming with nature's power, gar­
dens meticulously tended by eccentric wizards, and 
blessed groves touched by divine providence, plants 
can sometimes produce fruit bursting with primal 
magic. Not every fruit-bearing plant holds this 
stored magic, but those that do bear obvious signs: 
their colors are more vibrant or shift randoml y, their 
skin sparkles in the light or glows in the dark, soft 
hums emanate from them, or they feel peculiar to 
the touch.


A fruit-bearing plant that is suffused with magic
might produce ld6 pieces of primal fruit every 
week. Primal fruit remains potent for 1 week, 
after which it loses its magical properties but re­
mains edible. 
As an action, a creature can eat a piece of primal 
fruit to gain its effects. This fruit can be squeezed 
into juice or cooked into a dish and retains its 
magic. Choose an effect or roll on the Primal Fruit


Effects table to determine what happens when a
piece of the fruit is consumed. An identify spell or 
similar magic reveals the beneficial effect of a piece 
of fruit before it is eaten, but it doesn't reveal a curse 
or side effect.


PRIMAL FRUIT EFFECTS
d8 Effect 
The creature regains 3d8 + 4 hit points, and its 
skin sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim 
light for an additional 5 feet for l hour 
2 The creature feels a surge of might. For l hour, 
the creature has advantage on attack rolls using 
Strength, Strength checks, and Strength saving 
throws. When the effect ends, the creature gains l 
level of exhaustion. 
3 Waves of vitality crash over the creature. The crea­
ture's hit point maximum increases by 2dl0, and it 
gains the same number of hit points. The increase 
lasts until the creature finishes a long rest, at 
which time the creature must succeed on a DC l S


Charisma saving th row or be cursed with a random
form of lycanthropy (see "Lycanthropes" in the 
Monster Manual). 
4 The creature's skin prickles faintly. For l hour, it 
gains resistance to one damage type (chosen by 
the DM). 
5 Euphoric visions of bright light swim through the 
creature's mind. The creature gains the benefits of 
the death ward spell for 8 hours and must succeed 
on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poi­
soned for the duration. 
6 A faint humming drones in the background of 
everything the creature hears for l hour, during 
which the creature has advantage on saving throws 
against spells. 
7 The creature doesn't require food, drink, or sleep 
for ld4 days. For the duration, the creature can't 
be put to sleep by magic, and its dreams intrude 
upon its waking thoughts, imposing disadvantage 
on its Wisdom (Perception) checks. 
8 Whispers intrude on the creature's mind for 24 
hours. For the duration, the creature can tele­
pathically communic ate with any creature it can 
see within 120 feet ofit. If the other creature un­
derstands at least one language, it can respond 
telepathically.


UNEARTHLY ROADS
Currents of magic run through the world-invisible, 
artery-like networks that exert subtle influence and 
connect disparate lands. The greatest of these mag­
ical streams are persistent paths, often known by 
colloquial names or simply as unearthly roads. An 
unearthl y road acts like a sort of planar portal that 
stretches from one place to another, be they sites on 
the same world or on different planes of existence. 
Unearthly roads allow creatures to cross great dis-tances rapidly, moving from an entrance gate to an 
exit gate or visa versa. These paths operate like long 
tunnels, and a creature that travels on an unearthl y 
road progresses 21 miles of distance in the time it 
would normally take it to travel 1 mile. While on the 
road, glimpses of the world beyond might be visible 
in blurred or distorted visions of scenery or espe­
cially prominent landmarks. Creatures or specific 
details are not visible beyond an unearthl y road. 
Some unearthly roads serve as trade routes or se­
cret connections between distant lands. Others shift 
locations at noteworthy times or in response to ex­
ternal phenomena, like on specific anniversaries or 
in response to the phases of the moon. Some might

NATURAL HA ZARDS
Even without the threats of supernatural environ­
ments, the world is a dangerous place. The follow­
ing natural hazards expand on those presented in 
the Dungeon Masters Guide.


AVALANCHES
A typical avalanche (or rockslide) is 300 feet wide, 
150 feet long, and 30 feet thick. Creatures in the 
path of an avalanche can avoid it or escape it if 
they're close to its edge, but outrunning one is al­
most impossible. 
When an avalanche occurs, all nearby creatures 
must roll initiative. Twice each round, on initiative 
counts 10 and 0, the avalanche travels 300 feet until 
it can travel no more. When an avalanche moves, 
any creature in its space moves along with it and 
falls prone, and the creature must make a DC 15 
Strength saving throw, taking ldlO bludgeoning 
damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on 
a successful one. 
When an avalanche stops, the snow and other 
debris settle and bury creatures. A creature buried 
in this way is blinded and restrained, and it has total 
cover. The creature gains 1 level of exhaustion for 
every 5 minutes it spends buried. It can try to dig it­
self free as an action, breaking the surface and end­
ing the blinded and restrained conditions on itself 
CHAP TER 4 I DUN GEON MASTER'S TOOLS 169 
with a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check. 
A creature that fails this check three times can't at­
tempt to dig itself out again.


A creature that is not restrained or incapacitated
can spend 1 minute freeing a buried creature. Once 
free, that creature is no longer blinded or restrained 
by the avalanche.


FALLING INTO WATER
A creature that falls into water or another liquid can 
use its reaction to make a DC 15 Strength (Athlet­
ics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics ) check to hit the surface 
head or feet first. On a successful check, any dam­
age resulting from the fall is halved.


FALLING ONTO A CREATURE
If a creature falls into the space of a second creature 
and neither of them is Tiny, the second creature 
must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or 
be impacted by the falling creature, and any damage 
resulting from the fall is divided evenly between 
them. The impacted creature is also knocked prone, 
unless it is two or more sizes larger than the fall­
ing creature.


SPELL EQUIVALENTS OF NATURAL HAZARDS
Numerous spells emulate the wrath of nature, and 
you can use spell effects to represent a variety of 
natural hazards. The Spells as Natural Hazards ta­
ble presents some common environmental dangers 
and the spells you may use to approxim ate them.

Devious traps and multifaceted mysteries might
be staples of fantasy adventures, but they're not 
the easiest challenges for a DM to present on the 
fly. This section presents a selection of puzzles de­
signed to invite group participation and challenge 
adventurers of any stripe-from genius scholars to 
martial masters. Each puzzle is flexible enough to 
be included in your campaign as presented or cus­
tomized to fit the needs of a specific adventure. 
WHY USE PUZZ LES?


Puzzles provide exciting opportunities to use wit to
overcome obstacles and allow characters to collabo­
rate to make discoveries. You might add a puzzle to 
an adventure for any of the following reasons: 
• To encourage a party to discover information 
through teamwork 
• To provide an opportunity for characters to use 
their skills in uncommon ways 
• To make a setting feel more whimsical, mysteri­
ous, or otherworldly 
• To explain why no one has ever discovered some­
thing hidden close at hand 
• To reveal a secret no one knows and magic 
can't reveal 
Some puzzles can take considerable time to solve, 
so be mindful of how often you use them in your ad­
ventures. Remember , most puzzles don't need to be 
solved immediately, and they might be all the more 
satisfying if their riddles linger unresolved for multi­
ple sessions.


PUZ ZLE ELEM ENTS
Text that appears in a box like this is meant to be read 
aloud or paraphrased for the players when their char­
acters first arrive in a location with a puzzle or when 
otherwise noted. 
Additionall y, the following sections appear in 
each puzzle: 
Difficult y. Each puzzle is classified as easy, me­
dium, or hard. The harder the puzzle, the more 
likely the players will need hints to solve it. Puzzle Features. This section presents an overview 
of the puzzle's features and how they can be inter­
acted with. 
Solution. This section explains how the puzzle 
is solved. 
Hint Checks. This section suggests hints that char­
acters might use their skills to reveal. Provide one 
or more of the hints if the characters get stuck. If 
a character has proficie ncy in a hint's associated 
skill, give them that hint if they ask you for help. 
Customizing the Puzzle. This section explores how 
to integrate the puzzle into your adven tures, alter 
its difficulty, or make other adjustments.


HINTS
If players request a hint while attempting to solve 
a puzzle, consult that puzzle's "Hint Checks" sec­
tion. Each hint is associated with a skill and a DC.


If a character in the party has proficiency in a skill
related to a hint, share that hint with them. If the 
same skill is listed multiple times with the same or 
higher DCs, reveal hints with the lowest DCs first 
then hints with higher DCs if the group requests 
additional help.


If no character has proficiency in any of the listed
skills, characters can make ability checks using 
the listed skills and DCs. Those who succeed on a 
check learn the associated hint . 
Don't hesitate to reveal hints to the party. Hints 
provide characters with relevant skills the opportu­
nity to shine, even if they're not usually particular ly 
cunning. Additionall y, if party members have back­
grounds or campaign experiences that might tie into 
a puzzle, those make great reasons to provide char­
acters with additional hints.


RUNNING PUZ ZLES
Once you've presented a puzzle to a group, feel free 
to add and clarify details as you would in any other 
type of encounter. Try not to give away details of the 
puzzle's solution in your descriptions, but there's 
nothing wrong with letting a hint slip here or there.


Don't worry whether it's a player or a character
who's solving a puzzle. While hint checks provide 
a way for character experience to contribute to a 
puzzle's solution, ultimately the boundaries between 
a player's and a character's ability to solve a puzzle 
isn't as important as the group enjoying the chal­
lenge. However, if a player knows the answer to a 
puzzle in advance, urge them to share only hints 
their character learns. 
After presenting a puzzle, encourage the party 
to solve it together, to pool hints, and to share their 
insights. Work with the group to share any puzzle 
handouts and to take turns talking through their 
thoughts. Ultimately, solving a puzzle will be a vic­
tory for the whole group, not one individual. 
CHAPTER 4 I DUNGEON MA STER'S TOOLS 171 
172 CREATU RE PAINTINGS 
Difficulty: Easy


This short puzzle works anywhere that makes sense
for characters to peruse several paintings, such as 
in a museum or manor. These painting s could even 
appear in a sketchbook found in a dusty old drawer. 
This counting puzzle leads to a name of a creature.


Fit this into your campaign by making the name
of the creature the first item on a scavenger hunt or 
the first clue in a larger mystery.


This gallery is decorated with seven framed painting s
of creatures. A few chairs and benches have been 
placed in front of the art for viewing.


A plaque mounted on one of the walls bears the
following dedication: "In order to gain all knowledge, 
one must know where to start. Count on your enemies 
to reveal the source of the secret. This room is dedi­
cated to the defeat of all monsters within."


Characters should be free to explore the gallery and
inspect the paintings and dedication to discover the 
parts of the puzzle.


PUZZLE FEA TURES
There are seven painting s on the walls. The paint­
ings feature a gruesome werewolf under a full 
moon, a trio of gnolls fighting over a spear, a grin­
ning beholder, two trolls sitting under a tree, five 
kobolds around a bonfire, two gelatinous cubes 
patrolling a dungeon corridor, and three dragons 
in flight.


SOLU TIO N
Each painting features a number of creatures of 
a particular kind, as summarized in the Creature 
Paintings table. Counting into each creature's name 
by the number of creatures in the painting reveals a 
letter. When unscrambled, the letters spell out "owl­
bear." Characters are likely to reveal these letters in 
random order. Arranging them in the correct order 
is part of the puzzle.


CREATURE PAINTINGS

Gnolls 3 0


Werewolf w
Ko bolds 5 L


Beholder B
Gelatinous Cubes 2 E 
Dragons 3 A 
Trolls 2 R 
CHAP TER 4 I DUNGEON MASTER'S TOOLSSIGNIFICANCE OF "0WLBEAR " 
This puzzle's solution, "owlbear," might be the pass­
phrase to bypass a future trap or unlock a magically 
sealed door. It might also be a clue that points to 
a hidden treasure. For example, there might be a 
stuffed owlbear in another room that has treasure 
hidden inside it.


HINT CHECKS
Any character has the option of making these ability 
checks to receive a hint: 
Intelligence (Investigation) DC 10. The charac-
ter deduces that the number of creatures in a 
painting is important and uses that number to 
determine which letter of the creature's name they 
should review. 
Wisdom (Perception) DC 10. When looking at the 
dedication, the words "count on" alert the charac­
ter that they should count the creatures.


CUSTOMIZ ING THE PUZ ZLE
You can replace the monsters in the artwork with 
distinctive objects, members of obvious professions, 
and anything else that might logically be in a group. 
Then, follow the letter-counting method detailed in 
this puzzle to determine how man y subjects should 
feature in each piece of art. "'

REC KLE SS STEPS
Difficulty: Easy 
This puzzle features a word search on floor tiles, 
which might present a barrier to exploration in 
myriad scenarios. To cross safely, characters must 
first uncover what words they're searching for and 
then find them in the tiles. 
You ·enter a cobweb-filled room lit by torches on oppo­
site walls. Dust on the floor has collected in grooves 
that cover rows of five-foot -square tiles. On the oppo­
site wall, a solitary arch leads from the room. One wall 
bears the following inscription: 
Eight appear before your eyes, 
And eight remain in schooled disguise. 
Avoid all magic in this room, 
Lest reckless steps ensure your doom.


The tiles covering the floor of this room each bear a
single letter written in the Common alphabet, mak­
ing the room a giant word search. Traps beneath 
many of the tiles threaten those who move through 
the room heedless of the hidden words. PUZ ZLE FEA TURES 
The floor of this 60-foot-by-70-foot room is made 
of 5-foot-square stone tiles laid out in a grid. Each 
tile has a letter chiseled into it, as shown in puzzle 
handout 1 at the end of this chapter. Place a copy of 
the handout for this puzzle on the table, and allow 
players to use miniatures to show how their charac­
ters navigate the room. 
To safely walk across the room, a character must 
step on the correct tiles. Stepping on an incorrect 
tile sets off a trap.


TRAPS
Certain tiles (as indicated in this trap's "Solution" 
section) are trapped. A trapped tile is triggered 
when more than 20 pounds of weight are placed 
on it, activating the pressure plate underneath and 
causing jets of poisonous gas to spout from the 
cracks between the tiles. Any creature above the 
trapped floor tile or one of its adjacent tiles must 
make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 11 
(2d10) poison damage on a failed save, or half as 
much damage on a successful one. 
As an action, a character can disable a trap with 
a successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves' 
tools. If a character fails to disable the trap, the tile's 
trap can no longer be disabled. 
Characters can attempt to jump over trapped tiles, 
using the jump rules in the Player's Handbook.


SOLU TIO N
The only safe tiles for characters to step on are the 
ones with the faded black letters in diagram 4.1. 
Red letters spell out either "magic" or one of the 
schools of magic: abjuration, conjuration, divination, 
enchantment, evocation, illusion, necroma ncy, and 
transmutation. Stepping on one of these tiles trig­
gers a poison trap, as described earlier.


HINT CHECKS
Any character has the option of making these ability 
checks to receive a hint: 
Intelligence (Arcana) DC 10. The character sees 
one instance of a school of magic on the floor. 
Intelligence (Investig ation) DC 10. The character 
interprets the clue in the wall verse: there are 
eight schools of magic. 
Wisdom (Percept ion) DC 10. Each character who 
succeeds on this check sees an instance of the 
word "magic" in the floor.


CUSTOMIZING THE PUZZL E
Consider using this puzzle's structure to create any 
number of thematic word searches hiding deadly 
traps. Once you've created a hint suggesting what 
types of words to look for, it's a simple matter to cre­
ate your own grid of hidden words.


RAISING THE DIFFICULTY
You can increase this puzzle's difficulty by changing 
the word search's letters to use another alphabet, 
such as those presented in the Player's Handbook. 
Alternat ively, you can create an entirely new code to 
replace the letters, requiring the characters to find a 
cipher to reveal the tiles' meanings before they can 
undertake the puzzle and cross the room saf ely.


You can also increase the difficulty by introducing
trap variants, as described below.


TRAP VARIANTS
Rather than have the same poison gas trap on every 
trapped tile, each word can have a distinct trap as­
sociated with it, as described below: 
Magic. The trap triggers normally, as described in 
this puzzle's "Traps" section. 
Abjuration. The trap casts dispel magic on each 
creature in the room, using a 9th-level spell slot. 
Conjuration. The trap teleports the creature that 
triggered it back to the entrance of the room. That 
creature must also make a DC 15 Constitution 
saving throw, taking 11 (2d10) force damage on 
a failed save, or half as much damage on a suc­
cessful one. 
Divination. The creature that triggered the trap 
must succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence saving 
throw or be unable to perceive any of the letters

on the tiles by sight or touch. Any magic that ends 
a curse ends this effect on the character. A player 
whose character is affected by this trap should not 
be allowed to reference the accompanying player 
handout until the effect on that character ends. 
Enchantment. The trap casts suggestion (save DC 
15)on the creature that triggered it. On a failed
save, a gentle voice only the creature can hear tells 
it to move 5 feet in a random direction. This move­
ment might cause it to trigger another trap. 
Evocation. Magical fire erupts from the trapped tile. 
The creature that triggered this trap must suc­
ceed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 
11 (2d 10) fire damage on a failed save, or half as 
much damage on a successful one. 
Illusion. A suit of animated armor appears in an 
unoccupied space within 5 feet of the creature 
that set off this trap. The armor attacks only the 
creature that summoned it and can't leave the 
room. It doesn't set off any of the room's traps and 
disappears if it takes any damage. Otherwise, it 
lasts for 1 minute. 
Necromancy. Any creature that triggers this trap 
hears a banshee's wail in its mind. Unless the 
creature is a construct or undead, it must succeed 
on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a fail­
ure, the creature drops to 0 hit points. On a suc­
cess, it takes 10 (3d6) psychic damage. 
Transmutation. The trap casts polymorph (save DC 
15) on the creature that triggered it. On a failed 
save, the creature turns into a giant frog.

v SKEL ETON KEYS 
Difficulty: Easy


This puzzle presents a quick encounter useful for
providing treasure or information. It features a box 
with four locks. ·


You come upon a sinister metal box with an iron lock
built into each of its four sides. Each lock sports a 
keyhole with a sculpted image above it. Four iron keys 
hang from hooks on a nearby wall, and each key has a 
different number of teeth. Above the keys, the follow­
ing verse has been etched into the wall: 
The spells on these locks are all the same. 
Though each possesses a unique name. 
Count on your answer to unlock the way, 
But use the wrong key to your dismay. 
All four locks must be opened before the box's con­
tents (whatever they might be) can be accessed.


PUZZLE FEA TURES
Show the players puzzle handout 2 (see the end of 
this chapter) when their characters examine the 
keys. Each key has a different number of teeth: six, 
five, four, and three, respectively. 
Each lock has a creature molded in iron above it: a 
bat, snake, spider, or wolf, respectively. These locks 
can't be picked. If anything other than the correct 
key is placed inside a lock, creatures corresponding 
to the image above the lock (ld4 giant bats, ld4 
giant poisonous snakes, ld4 giant wolf spiders,
or ld4 wolves) are summoned into the room. Each 
summoned creature is hostile and disappears after 
10 minutes or when reduced to 0 hit points. These 
beasts can't be charmed or frightened.


SOLUTION
Once the chara cters identify the creature depicted 
above each lock, they should count the letters in 
each creature's name. The number of letters in a 
creature's name corresponds to the number of teeth 
on the correct key, as shown in the Skeleton Keys 
Solution table.


SKELETON KEYS SOLUTION
Lock Key


Bat Three teeth
Snake Five teeth


Spider Six teeth
Wolf Four teeth HINT CHECKS


Any character has the option of making these ability
checks to receive a hint: 
Intelligence (Nature) DC 10. The character knows 
that "natural" knowledge about bats, snakes, spi­
ders, and wolves in general won't help here. 
Wisdom (Perception) DC 10. The character real­
izes that the keys' skull-shaped heads are all the 
same and probably have no bearing on the puz­
zle's solution.


CUSTOMIZ ING THE PUZ ZLE
The focal parts of this puzzle are the locks and keys, 
not the chest. You could easily convert this puzzle 
to feature any types of locks, be they on doors, cells, 
books, or some more esoteric barrier. 
Beyond the form the locks and keys take, you 
might also consider adjusting the creatures depicted 
with each lock to suit your adventures. Just keep 
in mind that the number of teeth on each key must 
match the number of letters in your substitutions, 
and those substitutions should be things the charac­
ters can identif y.


RAISING THE DIFFICULTY
Rather than associating each lock with a particular 
image of a creature, consider presenting a riddle 
alongside each lock. The answer to each riddle 
should be the related creature's name, allowing 
characters to match the riddles' answers to the 
proper keys. 
CHAPTER 4 J DUNGEON MAS TER'S TOOLS 175


ALL THAT GLIT TERS
Difficulty: Medium 
This gem-filled room can be placed in any dungeon, 
estate, or building with multiple rooms and might 
serve as both a tr<lp and a place to obtain a reward. 
Dozens of gems lie strewn upon the floor. Amid the 
treasure stands a marble statue with its hands clasped 
in front of it. A placard at the statue's base reads, 
"Only one treasure may leave this room. Cross with 
another and find your tomb."


PUZ ZLE FEATURES
The statue, which is impervious to damage, depicts 
Ioun or some other god of knowledge or order. 
Any character who succeeds on a DC 10 Intelli­
gence (Religion) check can identify the figure be­
ing depicted.


DIAMOND
Between the palms of the statue's clasped hands is 
a diamond, which can only be found and retrieved 
once the puzzle is solved. Once the characters solve 
the puzzle, the statue's hands open, allowing the 
diamond to be taken. Upon breaching the threshold 
of the room with the diamond, a trapped soul in 
the form of a friendly, thankful spirit is released. 
The spirit leaves to pursue its own goals, and the 
diamond is left behind as a reward. The diamond is 
worth 5,000 gp.


GEMSTONES
An inventory of the room reveals the following gem­
stones scattered across the floor: eighteen pieces of 
jade, sixteen onyxes, fourteen amethysts, thirteen 
sapphires, twelve rubies, nine pieces of amber, eight 
citrines, five garnets, and one piece of quartz.


If a creature attempts to leave the room with any
of these stones, the gem disappears and an angry 
spirit trapped inside it is released. The spirit man­
ifests as a hostile undead creature of your choice, 
such as a ghost, specter, or skeleton. When this 
creature is reduced to 0 hit points, its form dissi­
pates, leaving no trace of itself behind.


NAMED SPIRITS
Characters hear each spirit whisper its name before 
it dissipates. The �ames themselves are not import­
ant, other than they must start with the appropriate 
letter of the alphabet. 
The following list provides names for all the im­
prisoned spirits, each name starting with the letter 
associated with the spirit's gemstone prison:

SOLUTION
An inventory of the room reveals gemstones in 
the amounts shown in the Gem Inventory table. 
The table lists the gems in alphabetical order, but 
you should list them in any other order when de­
scribing them to players so not to accidentally give 
away a hint.


Each type of gem is associated with a letter of the
alphabet, and each gem's letter is revealed by count­
ing into the alphabet by a number of letters equal to 
the number of gems of its type. For example, there 
is one piece of quartz, so "quartz" corresponds to 
the first letter of the alphabet (A), while there are 
fourteen amethysts, so "amethyst" corresponds to 
the fourteenth letter of the alphabet (N).


GEM INVENTORY
Gem Amount Letter 
Amber 9 
Amethyst 14 N 
Citrine 8 H 
Garnet 5 E 
Jade 18 R 
Onyx 16 p


Quartz A
Ruby 12 L 
Sapphire 13 M 
Once the gems are sorted by type and alphabet­
ized, characters can count into the alphabet by how 
many of each are in the room to reveal the words 
"in her palm." When a character speaks this phrase 
aloud, the statue's folded hands open, revealing the 
previously hidden diamond.


HINT CHECKS
Any character has the option of making these ability 
checks to receive a hint: 
Intellig ence (Arcana) DC 15. The character can 
determine that there are spirits imprisoned in the 
gemstones scattered on the floor. 
Intelligence (Religion) DC 10. The character 
knows that the statue represents a god of knowl­
edge and order, and the character has a strong 
feeling that the order of the gems in the room is 
important. 
Wisdom (Insight) DC 10. The character senses that 
the number of each type of gem isn't arbitrary.


CUSTOMIZING THE PUZZLE
This puzzle explores how to use groups of objects 
to disguise a message. So long as your groups can 
be arranged in a logical order (like the gems being 
arranged alphabeticall y in this puzzle), all you must 
do is adjust the number of items to correspond to 
a particular letter of the alphabet. Al ternatively, 
perhaps another organizing principle orders your 
groups. For example, tombstones that feature vary­
ing numbers of skulls might be arranged by dates, 
while stacks of books might be ordered by shared 
page-counts. These details can be easy to miss, though, so make sure you present a riddle or other 
signpost to make sure your players notice there's a 
puzzle at hand.


LOWERING THE DIFFICULTY
To make the puzzle easier to solve, a spirit can pro­
vide a hint in addition to giving its name. Coaxing a 
hint from a spirit requires a successful DC 15 Cha­
risma (Persuasion or Intimidation) check. Consider 
hints like "A is the first letter in the alphabet" and 
"The gemstones, in order, will help for a spell."


RELEASING THE SPIRITS
If the characters don't attempt to remove gems from 
the room, or if they spend too long deliberating, cre­
ate a new trigger to release the spirits. For example, 
perhaps a spirit is released if a character places a 
gem near the statue or if it's held for too long.


EYE OF THE BEHOL DER
Difficulty: Medium


This map puzzle is designed to lead a party through
a dungeon where a roaming beholder doesn't wish 
to be disturbed. A series of clues tie to the word 
"eye," and the characters must determine how to get 
through the area safely. 
A disorienting wave sweeps over you. Suddenl y, 
your surroundings are unfamiliar and shrouded 
in shadows.


Out of the gloom appears a hooded goblin carrying
a lantern. 
"Hello, friends!" the goblin says. "I can help you 
through these parts-if you can figure out my riddles. 
You don't want to make a wrong turn in here, as there 
are eyes everywhere. Solve the riddles and follow my 
directions to the letter." 
The goblin is friendly, and its offer is genuine. ft's 
name is Igor (pronounced eye-gar), which it reveals 
only if asked. The characters find themselves in 
a maze that emits magical darkness that can't be 
dispelled. No vision can penetrate this darkness, 
and only the goblin's lantern can illuminate it. Igor's 
lantern emits light in a 5-foot radius, but only so 
long as the goblin holds it. The lantern goes dark if 
any other creature takes custody of it.

The magical maze the characters find themselves in 
is comprised of an endless series of identical cham­
bers. Each chamber has four passages, one at each 
cardinal direction. The gobJin guide poses riddles 
that can lead the party along the path that ultimately 
CHAP TER 4 I DUNGEON MASTER'S TOOLS 
exits the maze. Each time the party moves through 
the correct passage and enters a new room, the gob­
lin provides them with a new riddle that hints which 
direction to travel in next. If they make an error, 
the characters encounter a monster of your choice 
and then must backtrack from their last correct 
turn. After three wrong turns, the party encounters 
the beholder.


HALLWAYS
The halls of this maze are 60 feet long and 10 feet 
wide. If the characters move away from the guide 
during combat or for any other reason, the goblin 
encourages them to follow him back to the last cor­
rect turn.


THE GOBLIN'S RIDDLES
Upon meeting the characters (and to discourage 
them from attacking), the goblin makes it clear 
there is no way out of the maze without his help.


Characters can determine that the goblin is sincere
in wanting to help with a successful DC 10 Wisdom 
(Insight) check. 
178 CHAP TER 4 I DUNG EON MAS TER'S TOOLS Once the goblin has the characters' attention, it 
provides the first riddle, then waits for the party to 
venture down a passage of its choice. The goblin 
stops at each intersection and either provides the 
next riddle (if the party chose the correct path) or 
avoids the monster the group encounters (if the 
party chose the incorrect path), leading the charac­
ters back to the last correct chamber along the path 
after any battle. 
The goblin's riddles (and their answers) are 
as follows: 
• What beast has the sharpest eye? (Eagle) 
• Threads get pulled through the eye of 
what? (Needle) 
• What is the eye to the soul? (Window) 
• Whose eye matters to a witch's brew? (Newt) 
• This eye curses you with misfortune. (Evil) 
• This eye brings a temporary calm. (Storm) 
• Roll a one on a six-sided die. Roll another and get 
the same. Take both together , and what's their 
name? (Snake eyes)


SOLUTION
The answer to each riddle begins with a letter in­
dicating the direction of the path the characters 
should follow next. The path provided by the riddles' 
answers takes the following route: east, north, west, 
north, east, south, south. This path leads the charac­
ters through some chambers more than once, which 
is a necessary part of the magic that will allow them 
to escape.


HINT CHE CKS
Any character has the option of making these ability 
checks to receive a hint: 
Charisma (Persuasion) DC 15. The goblin provides 
a hint in the form of a synonym of the riddle's an­
swer (for example, "lizard" for "newt"). 
Intelligence (Investigation) DC 10. After a few rid­
dles are answered correctly, a character notices 
that all the answers relate to eyes. 
Wisdom (Insight) DC 15. After one or more correct 
answers are given, the character realizes that 
each answer corresponds to a cardinal direction.


CUSTOMIZ ING THE PUZZLE
.The characters can easily persuade the goblin to 
join their party. What other secrets does the goblin 
know? Does he have an agenda for helping the char­
acters find their freedom? And why has he lingered 
in the maze if he knows the way out? There might 
be more to this guide than meets the eye.


FOUR BY FO UR
Difficulty: Medium 
This puzzle is easily situated in a dungeon, a dusty 
mausoleum, or an abandoned shrine. 
You enter a dimly lit chamber. Nine dwarf skulls 
rest near a four-foot-square set of tiles in the Aoor, 
and carved into a nearby stone altar is the following 
inscription: 
Brave warriors met their demise foretold. 
Their secret kept shall yet unfold. 
If crowns placed correctly on the shrine, 
Celestial beds for four of nine.


Solving this puzzle causes a secret compartment in
the altar to open, revealing treasure hidden within. 
The compartment can't be opened in any other way.


PUZZL E FEA TURES
Nine dwarf skulls rest near a grid of 1-foot-square 
tiles, as shown in puzzle handout 3 (see the end of 
this chapter). Columns and rows in the grid are la­
beled with the markings I, II, or III.


SOLU TION
The numbers labeling each row and column denote 
how many skulls belong within. Characters must 
place the skulls so that the correct number of skulls 
appear both in the rows and columns, while still 
covering four of the stars. This puzzle has multiple 
possible solutions, with one shown in diagram 4.2.

cates to the character that four of the skulls need 
to rest on tiles engraved with stars.

ILLU SIVE ISLAND
Difficulty: Medium 
Three numerical dials seal a box, door, or other 
locked object. Figuring out the correct combination 
is the goal of this puzzle, as there are no visible 
locks to pick.


PUZ ZLE FEA TURES
The numbers the dials are originally set to don't 
matter. If the players ask, choose any three digits 
you please. 
A corked wooden tube contains two clues: a map 
of an island and a set of directions.


MAP
Give the players a copy of puzzle handout 4 (see the 
end of this chapter). This map depicts an unfamiliar 
island with various landmar ks but no key.


DIRECTIONS
The directions are written on a single sheet of 
parchment and recount the route a group took in 
their search for treasure: 
Day 1. Our search for the lost treasure began at the 
northwest inlet, Windstaff Cove. Af ter unloading our 
necessities, we traveled east to Lone Pine, then south­
west past North ridge to the Palms Oasis. As evening 
approached, we continued southeas t to Anchor Point, 
then camped in the Great Dunes. 
Day 2. In the morning, we arose at the Dunes and 
headed to Deadman's Cave. After finding it empty, our 
party continued to the Golden Ziggurat. Heading due 
east, we made camp at the Swirling Sands. 
Day 3. After a strange night's sleep, we awoke on 
the third day back at Anchor Point with no memory 
or trace of traveling there. The Swirling Sands must 
have taken us in the night! We skirted the Swirling


Sands to reach the Red Tower but still couldn't find
the treasure. Thinking that we may have overlooked 
something in the cave, we headed back. From there, 
we headed to the southern coast to see if the treasure 
was at Kraken Point. Finding nothing, we returned to 
Anchor Point. What awaited us there was unlike any 
treasure we'd imagined.


SOLUTION
Characters who follow the directions and trace their 
paths on the map reveal three numbers: 3, 4, and 8 
(see diagram 4.3). Turning the dials to these num­
bers in the same order opens the locked ob ject.

HINT CH ECKS
Any character has the option of making these ability 
checks to receive a hint: 
Intelligence {Investigation) DC 10. The word 
"trace" from the Day 3 entry strikes the character 
as important, suggesting that the map is meant to 
be drawn on. 
Wisdom {Insig ht) DC 15. The map doesn't have 
labels, which means the names of the landmarks 
aren't significant. What's important are their posi­
tions relative to one another. 
Wisdom (Perception) DC 10. The fact that the ex­
pedition lasted three days is significant, as there 
are three dials. 
Wisdom (Survival) DC 15. The character knows 
the directions don't represent an efficient way to 
search an area and deduces the directions must 
be presenting some sort of message.


CUSTO MIZI NG THE PUZ ZLE
Consider creating your own map and series of direc­
tions to customize this puzzle. By crafting directions 
that suit locations in your campaign's' setting, you 
can create a puzzle that's integr ated into your adven­
ture's plot, using a map the characters might already 
possess. Your version of the puzzle can add as many 
digits and directions as you see fit, or it might reveal 
letters, symbols, or short words, depending on the 
complexity of your design.


RAISING THE DIFFICUL TY
You can increase this puzzle's challenge by dividing 
the map into pieces that need to be separately dis­
covered, or the characters might need to learn the 
directions from someone who personally explored 
the island. As long as the order of locations doesn't 
change, the code remains correct.


MA TERIAL CO MPONEN TS
Difficulty: Medium 
This puzzle might appear in a wizard's workshop, 
study, or spellbook. The solution leads to a pass­
word that reveals new or rare spells (such as those 
in chapter 3). Alternatively, the password can be 
used for any other function that fits with your story.


You find an old piece of paper bearing a list of spells
and components. Random letters are also scratched 
quickly on the paper between the two lists. A message 
at the top of the page says, "read untouched to gain 
new spells." 
Give the players a copy of puzzle handout 5 (see the 
end of this chapter).


PUZZL E FEA TURES
The wizard's study is filled with spell components, 
books, potions, and various odds and ends. While 
the various supplies might help characters solve 011\GRl\M 4.4: Ml\TERll\L COMPONENTS PU1.1.LE SOLUTION
the puzzle, the only item the characters need is the 
parchment. If the puzzle is giving them grief, they 
can take the parchment with them and find others 
who can help them solve it.


BOOKCASES
All around the wizard's study are shelves and cases 
filled with books, scrolls, and other supplies. A char­
acter who makes a successful DC 12 Intelligence 
(Arcana) check notices a spell component with no 
gp value from the list (such as a chip of mica or a bit 
of bat fur).


LISTS
The parchment has a list of spells and a list of 
material components. However, the components to 
the right don't match with the adjacent spells to the 
left. The parchment itself doesn't have any magical 
qualities, but the word it reveals potentially does.


Wizards and other spellcasters can identify the
correct spell components for any spell they know, 
but they must succeed on the Intelligence (Arcana) 
checks noted in the "Hint Checks" section below to 
recall the correct material components for any less 
familiar spells.


SOLU TIO N
Drawing a line from a spell to its material com­
ponent crosses out letters that fall between the 
columns, as shown in diagram 4.4. Once all spells 
are connected to components, the untouched letters 
spell out "presto," which, when said aloud with the 
paper in hand, causes one or more spell scrolls 
(or some other treasure of your choice) to magi­
cally appear. 
CHAP TER 4 I DUN GEON MASTER'S TOOLS 181


HINT CHECKS
Any character has the option of making these ability 
checks to receive a hint: 
Intelligence (Arcana) DC 10. The character recalls 
up to three of the material components for spells 
on the list they don't currently know. 
Wisdom (Insig ht) DC 15. The character suspects 
that the jumbled letters in the middle-or some 
number of them-probably spell out a command 
word, pass-phrase, or important clue. 
Wisdom (Perception) DC 10. The character notices 
that straight lines drawn between spells and mate­
rial components cross through some of the letters 
in the center.


CUSTOM IZING THE PUZZL E
While spells and components make easy to associ­
ate lists, you might also consider creating your own 
version of this puzzle using paired sets of monsters 
and creature types, planes of existence and their 
native inhabitants, famous figures in a setting and 
their homelands, and so forth.


LOWERING THE DIFFICULTY
If your party doesn't include char acters with con­
siderable magical expertise, consider adding art to 
the room's walls or on decorative book covers that 
reveal connections between the listed spells and 
components. These images might give away a few 
connections between the lists or lower the DCs of 
the puzzle's hint checks.


RAISING THE DIFFICULTY
Rather than using common spells the characters 
might be familiar with, a more challenging version 
of this puzzle might feature lost spells or other lore 
the party has no way of knowing. Only by consulting 
experts, undertaking research, or further adventur­
ing might the party reveal the connections between 
the two lists.


MEMBER S ONL Y
Difficulty: Medium 
A secret club, cultist meeting, or thieves' guild re­
quires a password to enter. In this puzzle, those 
who guard a certain door are so secretive that they 
change the password constantly, fearing someone 
might have infiltrated their members' ranks.


You watch a figure approach an oak door with a slide
window. The figure knocks, and a guard opens the 
window and says, "Six." The figure replies, "Three." 
The guard then opens the door, allowing the figure 
to enter. 
182 CHAPTER 4 I DUNGEON MAS TER'S TOOLSThis building seems to have only one entrance: the 
oak door with a small slide window. A guard opens 
the window and speaks a seemingly random num­
ber to anyone who knocks on the door.


PUZZLE FEATU RES
Even after observing the building from all angles, 
characters only see members entering through the 
one door after speaking to the guard.


DOOR
The door is made of oak reinforced with 3-ioch-wide 
iron bars. Three deadbolts secure the door, which 
is also barred from the inside, so there are no locks 
that can be picked from the outside.


GUARD
A guard stands on the other side of the door around 
the clock, and the only way to speak with the guard 
is through the door's slide window. The guard can 
be any sort of talking creature, such as an assassin,
a cult fanatic, or a thug. More monstrous options 
include a bugbear, wereboar, or nycal oth.
If a character knocks on the door, the guard slides 
open the window and gruffly gives a number, expect­
ing the proper response. The guard gives a different 
number each time someone knocks. Any proper 
response grants a single character entry, and the 
guard only allows one member to enter at a time.


Characters who provide incorrect answers and
attempt to enter again must disguise themselves 
in some way or be refused entry. The guard only 
willingly opens the door for someone who speaks 
the correct password. The guard raises the alarm if 
unauthorized people try to open or bypass the door, 
calling six more guards to help defend the entrance.


MEMBERS
If the characters continue watching the door, they 
see up to four more visitors approach it. To eaves­
drop on each exchange, the characters must suc­
ceed on a DC 12 group Dexterity (Stealth) check to 
remain hidden; if the group check fails, the visitor 
notices they're being observed and speaks quietly 
enough that their answer can't be overheard. 
Second Visitor. The guard opens the window and 
says, "Twelve." The visitor responds with "Six" 
and is allowed inside. 
Third Visitor. The guard opens the window and 
says, "Teo." The visitor responds with "Five" and 
is turned away. 
Fourth Visitor. The guard opens the window and 
says, "Seven." The visitor responds with "Five" 
and is allowed inside. 
Fifth Visitor. The guard opens the window and 
says, "Zero." The visitor responds with "One" and 
is turned away.


SOLU TION
Each member that approaches the door is given 
a number by the guard. There is no mathematical 
equation here; the only valid response to a number 
given by the guan;:I is the number of letters in the 
guard's number. 
For example, one member was given the number 
"six." There are three letters in the word "six," so 
the password for that member is "three." More po­
tential answers are provided in the Potential Pass­
words table.

deduces there is no mathematical equation that 
connects the numbers exchanged between the 
guard and visitors. 
Wisdom (Insight) DC 15. The character suspects 
that the answer has to do with the word, not 
the number.


CUSTOMIZING THE PUZ ZLE
Part of what makes this puzzle challenging is that it 
misleads players into thinking they're overhearing 
a mathematical equation. To figure out the solution, 
they have to first overcome their own assumptions.


An easier version of this puzzle might involve
counting the letters in any type of word the guard 
provides and responding with that number. Alter­
natively, the response to the guard's number might 
be any word with the same number of letters as that 
number-for example, "five" has four letters, making 
"duck" or "smog" suitable responses. The more your 
puzzle plays with numbers as words rather than dig­
its, the more challenging it's likely to be. EXACT CHAN GE 
Difficulty: Hard 
This puzzle provides an elaborate, coin-based lock 
to any sort of door, vault, or other barrier. 
The door here is locked and has no handle. Instead, 
there is a slot in the door with an engraving above 
it that reads, "Insert exact change here." Nearby, a 
wooden bowl of coins rests atop a wooden table.


The tabletop is engraved with nine squares in a
three-by-three grid. Nailed to the table's leg is a piece 
of parchment with the following instructions: 
Fifteen per column, fifteen per row; 
Diagonally, the same is so. 
A plea of warning to carefully count; 
No two places may hold the same amount. 
What coins in the center be fed through the door; 
Exact change for passage or trouble galore.


PUZ ZLE FEA TURES
The bowl on the table contains forty-five gold coins.


The puzzle requires that an exact number of coins
be fed into the slot into the door. If the wrong 
amount is deposited, it triggers either an alarm or a 
trap of your choice.


SOLUTIO N
Diagram 4.5 shows how to divide the forty-five coins 
so that every square has a different amount and 
each row and column adds up to fifteen.

FOUR ELEMEN TS
Difficulty: Hard 
This puzzle might !'lppear anywhere elementals of 
earth, air, fire, and water serve as guardians. If the 
puzzle isn't solved correct ly, one or more of these 
guardian elementals magicall y transform from stat­
ues and attack the characters. 
184 CHAPTER 4 I DUNGEON MASTER'S TOOLS The door slams behind you as you enter this hexag­
onal room. Four of the walls are covered in mosaics, 
each depicting the destruct ive force of one of the four 
elements. Four nine-foot-tall, stone statues of ele­
mentals line the far wall across from the closed door. 
Above the statues is a row of square tiles with triangu­
lar symbols painted on them. Four of these tiles have 
fallen off and lie strewn upon the floor, which bears 
the following inscription: 
Four elementals trapped in stone, 
Their elements ordered to lock their home. 
Even patterns against all odd, 
A tile misplaced awakens its god. 
In proper order safely seal these four, 
Or best one of each to open the door. 
Once the characters enter this room, the door be­
hind them slams shut. It can be opened only by com­
pleting this puzzle, and there are no other exits.


PUZ ZLE FEA TURES
The mosaics, statues, and tiles are described below 
in greater detail.


MOSAICS
The four wall mosaics depict the following: 
• A water elemental crashes through a city wall in a 
huge wave. In the center of the image is a triangle 
pointing downward. 
• An earth elemental looms over a group of war­
riors. A triangle pointing downward with a hori­
zontal line through it is carved into its chest. 
• A fire elemental burns through a forest town. 
In the center of the flames is a triangle point­
ing upward. 
• An air elemental gusts through a stormy sky.


Within the clouds is a triangle pointing upward
with a line running horizontally through it.


STATUES
The statues are actual elementals magically bound 
in stone. The magic that turned these elementals 
into statues is slowly coming undone, as the tile pat­
tern that binds them has fallen apart.


TILES
If the characters don't replace the four fallen tiles in 
their proper sequence, all four statues revert to their 
true forms at the same time and attack the charac­
ters. The exact timing of this event is left to you, but 
the characters should be given enough time to take 
a crack at solving the puzzle. The characters can 
also release the elementals individually by putting 
titles in the wrong order or orientation. 
Puzzle handout 6 (see the end of this chapter) 
illustrates the row of tiles set into the wall above 
the statues. Without a check, the characters real­
ize that four of the tiles fell down when the door 
slammed shut behind them. With a successful DC 
15 Intelligence (Arcana) check, a character can de­
termine that these tiles are what keeps the elemen­
tals bound. 
If a tile is placed in the wrong place in the row, 
the corresponding elemental is freed from its 
stone prison and attacks. Only one of each elemen­
tal appears: 
• If the imprope rly placed tile has an open triangle 
pointing downward, the water elemental is freed. 
• 1f the imprope rly placed tile has an open triangle 
pointing upward, the fire elemental is freed. 
• If the imprope rly placed tile has a triangle point­
ing upward with a horizontal line running through 
it, the air elemental is freed. 
• If the improperly placed tile has a triangle point­
ing downward with a horizontal line running 
through it, the earth elemental is freed. SOLU TIO N 
The correct, complete pattern is shown here: 
, ............ ..... ..... , 
L. 9\7\l L.A. \l L.L. 9\7\l L.A. 
1•••· ······ ············ · 
2 3 4 5 G 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 
The odd-numbered tiles form a recurring pat­
tern of open triangles that alternate between 
pointing up and down. Tiles 1, 5, 9, and 13 are 
upward-poi nting triangles, while tiles 3, 7, and 11 
are downward-pointing triangles. 
The even-numbered tiles display a different pat­
tern. Tiles 2 and 4 point downward, but the first of 
them has a line through the triangle. Tiles 6 and 8 
follow the same pattern, but the triangles point up. 
The pattern then repeats, with tiles 10 and 12 being 
the same as tiles 2 and 4 and tile 14 being the same 
as tile 6.


Solving the puzzle or defeating all four elementals
causes the door to the room to swing open.


HINT CHECKS
Any character has the option of making these ability 
checks to receive a hint: 
Intellig ence (Investigation) DC 15. The character 
notes the words "even" and "odd" in the verse on 
the room's floor and believes they have some sig­
nificance to the missing tiles. 
Wisdom (Perception) DC 10. The character 
can deduce which tiles correspond to which 
elementals.


CUSTOM IZING THE PUZZLE
Interweaving multiple patterns makes it easy to 
disguise them. With this in mind, you might use any 
group of symbols to create as elaborate a series of 
patterns as you please, then challenge players to 
fill in a missing segment. While the symbols in this 
puzzle refer to the four elements, you might use holy 
symbols, colors, dolls on a shelf, or any other repeat­
ing design to convey your puzzle. 
When an elemental is defeated, it might leave be­
hind a valuable gemstone , a map fragment, a clue to 
some other puzzle, or something similar.


RAISING THE DIFFICULTY
To increase the difficulty of this puzzle, enforce a 
time factor: perhaps one elemental breaks free at 
the end of every five minutes of real time that pass 
until the puzzle is solved.


You can also raise the difficulty by having statues
depict genies instead of elementals. In this case, 
replace the four elementals with a dao, a djinni, an 
efreeti, and a marid. These genies are compelled to 
attack the characters and can't be reasoned with. 
CHAPTER 4 I DUNGEON MAS TER'S TOOLS 185


HAUNTED HALL WAY
Difficulty: Hard


Many unquiet spirits linger in the world because
they can't bare to leave something behind. In this 
puzzle, finding the solution also means helping a 
lost soul find peace. 
Six alcoves line this hall, each one numbered from one 
to six. On the floor of each alcove, a lit candle gen-
tly flickers. 
From the hall's far end drifts a low moan. There, 
barely visible, sobs the apparition of a small girl hov­
ering over a discarded rag doll. "Names, names," 
she cries. "I can remember them all except the 
one I need." 
The spirit, Dolora, is a harmless apparition who 
won't engage the party in combat. If threatened, she 
vanishes and reappears at the opposite end of the 
hall, sobbing anew. 
If approached with compassion, Dolora bemoans 
the fact that she can't pick up her doll until she 
speaks its name, which she has forgotten. She re­
fuses to leave this place without the doll. 
Dolora, who only recalls fragmented memories 
of her life, can't answer many questions. This is 
particular ly true about the messages associated 
186 CHAP TER 4 I DUN GEON MA STER'S TOOLS with the alcoves in the hall (see "Alcoves" later 
in this section). While Dolora can't answer vague 
questions about the candles' clues (such as "Who 
is this talking about?"), she can provide the names 
of specific people when prompted. For example, if 
a character asks directly, "What was your mother's 
name?" Dolora provides the correct response. She 
also spells out the name, which is a clue that the 
spelling is important.


PUZZ LE FEA TURES
Dolora can't leave the hall and avoids the alcoves.


ALCOVES
The hall is lined with six alcoves, each one with a 
unique numeral between 1 and 6 carved above it. A 
verse scratched into the back wall of each alcove is 
made visible by the candlelight. Each verse is pre­
sented below, accompanied by a parenthetical expla­
nation that shouldn't be shared with the players or 
their characters: 
Verse 1. "Not his keeper, nor he mine; loved and 
hated at the same time." (This refers to Dolora's 
brother, whose name was Sam.) 
Verse 2. "My first vision: her hazel eyes. My first 
sound: her lullabies." (This refers to Dolora's 
mother, whose name was Delia.) 
Verse 3. "Her lives she lost, all three by three, and 
through the dark this hunter sees." (This refers to 
Dolora's cat, whose name was Fifi.) 
Verse 4. "Lines in his face of life lived long; stories 
were his paternal song." (This refers to Dolora's 
grandfather, whose name was Tobias.) 
Verse 5. "Mentor and guide, her lessons learned. 
Knowledge measured by letters I earned." 
(This refers to Dolora's teacher, whose name 
was Johana.) 
Verse 6. "Loved to eat hay, just as her friends did; 
Jived in one room with a shoat and a kid." (This re­
fers to Dolora's horse, whose name was Alexia.)


Each verse describes someone who was close to
Dolora. Once the characters determine who a verse 
is talking about, they may ask Dolora to provide 
the correct name. For example, "What is your cat's 
name?" is a valid question for verse 3. The spirit 
then answers, "Fifi," and she spells it aloud.


CANDLES
Each candle is a simple, 6-inch-tall wax taper. While 
in this hall, the candles never melt down and can't 
be extinguished.


RAG DOLL
If the characters examine the rag doll or ask Dolora 
about it, she imparts the following information: 
"My doll knows all six-the first for the first, the sec­
ond for the second, the third for the third, the fourth 
for the fourth, the fifth for the fifth, and the sixth for 
the sixth."


SOLUTION
Once the characters learn all six names, they must 
extrai::t one letter from each name, as noted in the 
Remembered Names table. An alcove's number 
determines which letter to extract; for example, 
"Alexia" is the name connected to the verse in al­
cove 6, and the sixth Jetter in that name is A.

6 Alexia A 
The doll's name is Sefina. Once Dolora is told this, 
she picks up the doll, speaks its name, and disap­
pears with it, her spirit having been laid to rest. If 
there's some piece of information you wish to have 
the spirit reveal to the party, such as the location of 
a nearby treasure or the secret of a more dangerous 
spirit, Dolora whispers this as she fades away.


HINT CHE CKS
Any character has the option of making these ability 
checks to receive a hint: 
Charisma (Persuasion) DC 10. Dolora thinks of 
the character as her friend. When this character 
figures out the answer to a riddle, Dolora calls out 
the name of the person it's about unprompted (for 
example, as soon as the character says "mother" 
aloud, Dolora calls out "Delia"). 
Charisma (Intimi dation) DC 15. The character 
frightens Dolora into divulging information. She 
tells the character that she remembers the names 
of people she knew. Dolora also reveals that it's 
important that their names be spelled correctly, 
though she doesn't say why. 
Intellig ence (Investigation) DC 15. The character 
interprets Dolora's cryptic clue about the doll as 
follows: "all six" refers to the six letters of the 
doll's name, which can be determined by gather­
ing information from the verses in the six alcoves. WHAT 'S ON THE MENU 
Difficulty: Hard


The characters discover that a popular local tavern
is a front for a secret organization that they seek 
to join or infiltrate. The name of the tavern can be 
whatever you want it to be. One suggestion is the 
Cloak & Dagger. 
To get their foot in the proverbial door, the char­
acters must speak the correct password to the 
tavern-keeper , Holda Heidrun. They can discover 
this password by solving a puzzle hidden in the 
tavern's menu.


The tavern is crowded with happy people enjoying
their food and drinks. Behind the bar, a stocky woman 
is wiping down the wooden bar top. She looks up as 
you enter and nods toward an empty table before her 
attention is drawn elsewhere. You see a copy of the 
tavern's menu on the table.


Customize the tavern and flesh out its occupants as
you see fit. 
In addition to being the tavern-keeper , Holda 
Heidrun is the keeper of many secrets. If the char­
acters prod her for information, she asks for the 
password, and if the characters don't know it, she 
divulges nothing of consequence. "If you're worth 
your weight in copper," she says, "you'd speak the 
password to earn my trust."


PUZ ZLE FEA TURES
A sign at the bar declares that a meal costs 1 sp, a 
mug of ale costs 4 cp, a glass of fine wine costs 1 
sp, and a bottle of fine wine costs 3 sp. The menu 
on the table contains a list of specialties the tavern 
serves, and how much each item costs. Only the 
menu is needed to solve the puzzle.


MENU
Characters who peruse the menu see the items 
listed in the Menu Items table, in the order given.


MENU ITEMS
Item Price 
Corn and lentil soup 12 cp


Rabbit stew l cp
Ale and ch_eese pastry 7 cp 
Brandied ham and carrots 9 cp 
Grilled fish and carrots 6 cp 
Seared boar and potatoes 9 cp 
Dragonfire mead 11 cp

SOLUTION
Arrange the menu items in alphabetical order, then 
count into each item by the number of letters indi­
cated in its price, as shown in the What's On the 
Menu Solution table. Stringing the seven letters 
together forms the password: chimera.


WHAT'S ON THE MENU SOLUTION
Item (Price) 
Ale and cheese pastry (7 cp) 
Brandied ham and carrots (9 cp) 
Corn and lentil soup (12 cp) 
Dragonfire mead (11 cp) 
Grilled fish and carrots (6 cp) 
Rabbit stew (1 cp) 
Seared boar and potatoes (3 cp) Letter 
C (7th letter) 
H (9th letter) 
I (12th letter) 
M (11th letter) 
E (6th letter) 
R (1st letter) 
A (3rd letter) 
The characters can figure out the password with­
out putting the menu items in alphabetical order. 
Once they get all seven letters, they must solve the 
anagram to get the password.


Speaking the correct password to Holda grants
access to whatever secrets she's keeping-fuel for 
the characters' next adventure . 
188 CHAPTER 4 I DUNG EON MAS TER'S TOOLS HINT CHECKS


Any character has the option of making these ability
checks to receive a hint: 
Charisma (Intimidation or Persuasion) DC 15.


The character convinces Holda to whisper the
following hint: "Count your lucky coppers that we 
have seven choices on the menu for you." 
Dexterity (Stealth) DC 15. The character blends 
in with the crowd to eavesdrop on another table, 
overhearing the patrons discussing how they must 
have gotten a misprinted menu because the prices 
don't seem right, or bemoaning the fact that the 
menu doesn't list items in alphabetical order. 
Intellig ence (His tory) DC 15. The character recalls 
stories of how secret messages used to be sent 
through taverns using common items anyone 
could access, such as menus. 
Wisdom (Perception) DC 15. The character notices 
the prices on the menu don't make much sense. 
For example, why is rabbit stew so much cheaper 
than corn and lentil stew?


CUSTOMIZ ING THE PUZZL E
�������-
"Chimera" might not be the password but rather 
a reference to something or someone else in the 
tavern. Characters who solve the puzzle and suc­
ceed on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check might 
notice another patron wearing a cloak pin shaped 
like a chimera, or spot a shield emblazoned with a 
chimera hanging on a wall that conceals a secret 
door. Only after speaking to the patron or seeing 
what's on the other side of the secret door do the 
characters obtain the actual password, which can 
be anything you want. 
You can easily change "chimera" to something 
else by swapping out menu items, choosing different 
letters within the replacement items, and adjusting 
the prices accordin gly.


LOWERING THE DIFFICULTY
Other tavern patrons can provide additional hints 
by talking among themselves in places where the 
characters can overhear them. A patron might say 
something like, "This inn keeps getting more expen­
sive. With these fancy new meals, I'm surprised they 
aren't charging a copper per letter!" 
A too-helpful barmaid might take pity on the strug­
gling characters and walk them through the various 
menu items in the order that would allow them to 
skip the anagram (ale and cheese pastry, brandied 
ham and carrots, corn and lentil soup, dragonfire 
mead, grilled fish and carrots, rabbit stew, and 
seared boar and potatoes). She might even recom­
mend that the characters "start with the ale and 
cheese pastry, and continue on from there."
