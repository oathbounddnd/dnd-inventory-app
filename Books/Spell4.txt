Description:
gp, which the spell consumes)
This spell is identical to raise dead, but it works only on a
creature that died of old age. The spell grants the raised
elder one additional year of life. The raised creature has
entirely white hair, its eyes are weak, and it loses 2 points
each from Strength and Constitution; no magic less
potent than a wish can restore these lost points. In all other
respects, the creature can live out its life normally until the
added year elapses.
Raise elder has no effect if it’s cast on the same creature a
second time.

Name: RAISE QUESTING DEAD
Level: 6
School: Necromancy
Casting Time: 1 hour
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M (a diamond worth at least 500 gp,
Duration: Instantaneous
Description:
which the spell consumes)
This spell is identical to raise dead, except it empowers you
to impose a geas on the creature you raise. The targeted
soul can opt to decline the geas, in which case it isn’t
restored to life. If the creature accepts your geas, it must
complete the task within 30 days. If it accepts but fails to
meet the conditions of the geas, it dies on the dawn of the
31st day and its spirit again departs the mortal world. If it
accomplishes the task, it’s free to live out the remainder of
its restored life as it chooses.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell
slot of 7th or 8th level, the creature has a year to fulfill its
geas, allowing for much more complex demands. When
you cast this spell using a spell slot of 9th level, the geas
lasts until it’s fulfilled, no matter how long that takes, or
until it’s ended by remove curse, greater restoration, or wish.
Fireball Variants
Fireball is perhaps the most iconic damage-dealing spell
in fantasy RPGs, so why mess with it? Partly to add an
interesting twist to something familiar, partly to give it a
story or character spin, and partly just for fun. Here are
three options to consider for variant fireballs used by your
PC or NPC casters.
Fireball can be easily spiced up by changing its appearance
and damage type. The following table offers twenty
options for reskinning fireball; roll a d20 or choose the
options that best suit the character who’s casting the
spell. The new appearance can become emblematic of
that caster, as personal as a signature, a catchphrase, or a
distinctive facial feature.
All items created by a variant appearance vanish as soon
as their damage is done; no items or materials can be
recovered.

2 Ball of fiery serpents Acid

18 A whirling, icy tornado Cold
19 Flesh-eating orange slime Acid
20 Spheres of pure, explosive energy Force
Fireball is an instantaneous spell, but it might just as easily
resemble heat metal, with a round of warning, a round of
damage, and a round of additional damage. Spreading
out the damage this way could be called a slow-burn fireball.
Though this is a bit more bookkeeping, such a spell
would be appropriate for limited use by a pyromaniacal
spellcasting NPC.
While fireball is an area of effect spell, a smaller version
could attack a single target. This might be called solitary
fireball, and could easily find a place in an elementalist’s
spellbook or in the hands of a fire imp or an efreet.
Finally, the third variant here is a bouncing fireball, which
(as the name implies) strikes one location, then bounces
according to the caster’s direction to a second location
and explodes again. This is similar to how chain lightning
works, but bouncing fireball attacks multiple targets in
both locations. The tradeoff is lower damage against each
creature when compared to chain lightning.

Name: SOLITARY FIREBALL
Level: 2
School: Evocation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 150 feet
Components: V, S, M (a candle and a pinch of sulfur)
Duration: Instantaneous
Description:
A bright streak flashes from your pointing finger to a
point you choose within range, where it blossoms with a
low roar to engulf a single creature in searing flame. That
creature takes 6d6 fire damage, or half damage with a
successful Dexterity saving throw. Solitary fireball does not
ignite other flammable objects.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by
1d6 for each slot level above 2nd.

=== SPELL START ===
Name: SLOW-BURN FIREBALL
Level: 3
School: Evocation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 150 feet
Components: V, S, M (small chunks of coal and sulfur)
Duration: 3 rounds
Description:
A bright streak flashes from your pointing finger to a
point you choose within range, where it slowly ignites
the air itself with phlogiston. Each creature in a
20-foot-radius sphere around the target point
takes 4d6 fire damage, or half damage with
a successful Dexterity saving throw.
Every target that takes damage takes
the same amount of damage again at the start of your next
two turns unless it uses an action to put out the flames on
its clothing, hair, and other accoutrements. Flammable
objects in the area that aren’t being worn or carried are
also ignited.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by
1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.

Name: BOUNCING FIREBALL

Range: 150 feet

Duration: Instantaneous
Description:
and three iron pins)
A bolt of flame streaks from your finger toward a point
you choose within range, then explodes into an inferno
of flame. Each creature within 20 feet of the explosion
takes 7d6 fire damage, or half damage with a successful
Dexterity saving throw.
Immediately afterward, a second bolt of flame streaks
from that explosion to a second target point you can
see exactly 40 feet from the first explosion. It explodes
again at the second target point, causing another 7d6 fire
damage (halved by a successful Dexterity saving throw).
Then the flame jumps instantly again to a third target
point, also within your line of sight and exactly 40 feet
from the second explosion, where it detonates for the final
time with identical results.
Note that for the second and third bursts, the flame
jumps exactly 40 feet—never more, never less—and if any
part of a burst area overlaps the area of a previous burst,
the burst fails to happen and the spell
ends immediately.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this
spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher,
the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot
level above 6th.

It is an age of war. Civilization slowly gives way to
encroaching wilderness, and once-mighty empires
now lie beneath the waves. Only magic and the warmth
of hope keeps lights aglow when dread things prowl,
and priestly wardings are bent by demonic rage.
The omens are dire. The roads to the shadow realm
are open again, and the fey have returned to claim their
ancient tribute. In the north the giants prepare for
Ragnarok, while the goblins in the west grow restless.
In the Crossroads, the shadow of the vampire princes falls
across the land. The World Serpent is stirring—and not
even all-knowing Baba Yaga can say what will happen next.
Now more than ever, Midgard needs heroes to stand against
the dark, driving it back with spell, steel, and cunning!

No matter how you slice it, magic is at the heart of fantasy—
and nothing says magic like a massive tome of spells.
This tome collects, updates, tweaks, and expands spells from
years of the Deep Magic for Fifth Edition series—more than
700 new and revised spells. And it adds a lot more:
• 19 divine domains from Beer to Mountain and Speed to Winter;
• 13 new wizard specialties, such as the elementalist and the timekeeper;
• 6 new sorcerous origins, including the Aristocrat and the Farseer;
• 3 otherworldly patrons for warlocks, including the Sibyl;
• expanded treatments of familiars and other wizardly servants;
• and much more!
This tome is not just for wizards, warlocks, and sorcerers. Deep Magic also
expands the horizons of what’s possible for bards, clerics, druids, and even
rangers and paladins. It offers something new for every spellcasting class!
With these new spells and options, your characters (or your
villains) can become masters of winter magic, chaos magic, or
shadow magic. Seek out hidden colleges and academies of lost
lore. Learn new runes, hieroglyphs, and cantrips to break down
the walls of reality, or just bend them a bit.
Deep Magic contains nothing but magic from start to finish!

School: Necromancy
Casting Time: 1 minute
Range: 1 mile
Components: V, S, M (a statuette carved in the likeness
Duration: Permanent; one generation
Description:
of the victim worth at least 1,250 gp)
You invoke the darkest curses upon your victim and its
descendants. This spell doesn’t require that you have a
clear path to your target, only that your target is within
range. The target must make a successful Wisdom saving
throw or be cursed until the magic is dispelled. While
cursed, the victim has disadvantage on ability checks and
saving throws made with the ability score that you used
when you cast the spell. In addition, the target’s firstborn
offspring is also targeted by the curse. That individual is
allowed a saving throw of its own if it is currently alive, or
it makes one upon its birth if it is not yet born when the
spell is cast. If the target’s firstborn has already died, the
curse passes to the target’s next eldest offspring.
Ritual Focus. If you expend your ritual focus, the curse
becomes hereditary, passing from firstborn to firstborn
for the entire length of the family’s lineage until one of
them successfully saves against the curse and throws off
your dark magic.

You release an arcane arrow that traces the path of the
triggering attack back to your unseen attacker, provided
the attacker is in range. That creature must succeed on
a Dexterity saving throw or be outlined in light until
the end of your next turn. While outlined in light, the
creature sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius, any attack
roll against it is made with advantage if the attacker can
see the creature, and the creature can’t benefit from
being invisible.

Name: AMPLIFY SOUND
Level: 1
School: Divination
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 120 feet
Components: S, M (a small cup and bit of string)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Description:
You turn your attention to a point you can see within
range, creating an invisible sensor in that location. For the
duration of the spell, you hear sounds from that point as if
you were in its space.
If the space where the point is located is subjected
to thunder damage, you take the thunder damage as if
you were in the space, but you don’t suffer other effects
associated with that thunder damage. For example, if a
creature casts the thunderwave spell, and the point you
chose is within the spell’s area, you take thunder damage
as if you failed the saving throw, but you aren’t pushed.
A creature that can see the sensor (such as a creature
benefiting from see invisibility or truesight) sees a thin,
luminous string winding from the sensor to you.

Description:
You touch a nonmagical melee weapon, temporarily
making it stronger, sharper, and more destructive. Until
the spell ends, the weapon deals an extra 1d6 damage of its
type on a hit. This spell doesn’t make the weapon magical.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a slot of

within your reach for each slot level above 2nd.

Description:
You conjure an illusory apparition in an unoccupied
space within range. The shape of the apparition changes
in the minds of creatures who behold it, appearing as a
comforting something or someone that beckons to the
creature. When you cast this spell, choose up to three
creatures within range that can see the apparition. Each
target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be
charmed by the apparition until this spell ends. While
charmed, a target must take the Dash action and move
toward the apparition by the safest available route on

each of its turns, unless there is nowhere to move. If the
target ends its turn within 5 feet of the apparition, the
target takes 2d10 psychic damage, and the spell ends for
that target.

Name: AQUEOUS ARENA
Level: 2
School: Transmutation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 90 feet
Components: V, S, M (a drop of water)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Description:
You alter the air in a 15-foot-radius, 30-foot-high cylinder
centered on a point you can see within range. Within the
cylinder, air becomes viscous and takes on some of the
properties of water. Creatures inside the cylinder move
and fight as if underwater, and objects that aren’t being
worn or carried float or sink to the top or bottom of the
cylinder as if underwater. Creatures can move vertically
within the cylinder as if swimming in water.
Though the cylinder acts like water, it is still air.
Creatures and objects within the cylinder don’t have
resistance to fire damage from being fully immersed in
water, and creatures that breathe air can breathe normally
while inside the cylinder. This spell has no effect if cast on
a point underwater, and any part of the cylinder that is
underwater has no special effect.
When the spell ends, any creature above the ground that
doesn’t have a flying speed falls, taking falling damage as
normal.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell
slot of 4th level or higher, the cylinder’s radius increases
by 5 feet and its height increases by 10 feet for each slot
level above 3rd.

You fling a condensed ball of colorful lights and sounds at
a creature you can see within range. Make a ranged spell
attack. On a hit, the target takes 1d6 thunder damage, and
the target is distracted by the lights and sounds until the
start of your next turn. While distracted, a creature must
make a Constitution saving throw whenever it casts a spell
that requires concentration. On a failed save, the creature
can’t concentrate on that spell, losing concentration on it
at the start of your next turn.
The spell’s damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th
level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).

Description:
You exhale a massive volume of air, propelling yourself
up to 15 feet in a direction of your choosing to an
unoccupied space you can see. This movement doesn’t
provoke opportunity attacks. Each creature in a 15-foot
cone originating from the space you just left must make a
Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes
2d6 bludgeoning damage and is pushed up to 10 feet away
from your original space. On a successful save, a creature
takes half the damage and isn’t pushed.
If a pushed creature strikes a solid surface, it takes 1d6
bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it was pushed. If
a pushed creature is pushed into another creature, that
creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw or take
the same damage and be knocked prone.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell
slot of 3rd level or higher, you, and each creature that
fails the saving throw, are pushed an additional 10 feet

Creatures can’t pass through the bubble, but physical
objects, energy, or other spell effects can. The bubble has
an AC equal to your spell save DC and hit points equal to
twice your spell save DC. The spell ends for the enclosed
creature if the bubble is reduced to 0 hit points. A creature
inside the bubble has three-quarters cover from attacks
outside the bubble, and creatures outside the bubble have
half cover from attacks from the enclosed creature. When
the enclosed creature would take damage from an attacker
or effect outside the bubble, the creature can choose to
take only half the damage and reduce the bubble’s hit
points by an amount equal to the other half of the damage.
The bubble is weightless and just large enough to
contain the creature inside of it. When the enclosed
creature moves, the bubble moves with it. If the bubble
was created in an area with air, the bubble contains

the area or starts its turn there must make a Wisdom
saving throw. On a failed save, the creature starts to
engage in celebratory revelry: drinking, singing, laughing,
and dancing. Affected creatures are reluctant to leave
the area until the spell ends, preferring to continue the
festivities. They forsake appointments, cease caring
about their woes, and generally behave in a cordial
(if not hedonistic) manner. This preoccupation with
merrymaking occurs regardless of an affected creature’s
agenda or alignment. Assassins procrastinate, servants
join in the celebration rather than working, and guards
abandon their posts.
The effect ends on a creature when it is attacked, takes
damage, or is forced to leave the area. A creature that
makes a successful saving throw can enter or leave the area
without danger of being enchanted. A creature that fails
the saving throw and is forcibly removed from the area
must repeat the saving throw if it returns to the area.

deafen your enemies. A cacophonous clap of thunder
slams out from you in a 30-foot cone that is audible
out to 300 feet. Each creature in the cone must make a
Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature
takes 4d6 thunder damage and is deafened until the end of
its next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half the
damage and isn’t deafened.
When you cast this spell, up to four friendly creatures
within 30 feet of you that can see you can each use a
reaction to join the chorus with a clash of weapon against
shield, a ringing shout, or other loud noise. For each
creature that joins the chorus, the spell’s damage increases
by 1d6, and the cone’s size increases by 5 feet.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell
slot of 4th level or higher, the primary damage increases
by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.

Description:
friendly creature you can see within 60 feet of you is
reduced to 0 hit points
A protective chrysalis surrounds a creature you can
see within range as it is reduced to 0 hit points. While
protected in this way, the target is still unconscious from
being reduced to 0 hit points, but unlike when a creature
is normally unconscious, attacks from attackers within
5 feet aren’t automatically critical hits. In addition, the
target has three-quarters cover and isn’t prone while
protected. The target must make applicable death saving
throws, as normal.
The chrysalis has hit points equal to 5d8 + three times
your spellcasting ability modifier. When the protected
target would take damage, the chrysalis takes the damage
instead. The chrysalis is destroyed when it has 0 hit points.
If the chrysalis remains at the end of your next turn,
the target regains hit points equal to the chrysalis’s
remaining hit points, then the chrysalis crumbles to dust
and is destroyed. As the chrysalis crumbles, spectral wings
manifest on the target’s back, and the target gains a flying
speed of 30 feet for 1 minute.

When the wall appears, each creature within its area
must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save,
a creature is covered in a sticky, heavy film of shadow
until the spell ends. A creature covered in the shadowy
film is blinded, takes a −1 penalty to its AC, and can’t
benefit from being invisible. Furthermore, the first time a

The dragon is under your control for 8 hours, after
which it stops obeying any command you have given it.
To maintain control of the dragon for another 8 hours,
you must cast this spell on the dragon before the current
8-hour period ends, or you can use an action to make an
ability check using your spellcasting ability contested by
the dragon’s Charisma check, reasserting your control
over the dragon for another 8 hours on a success.  This use
of the spell reasserts your control over the dragon rather
than animating a new one. Once you have reasserted your
control over the dragon with two successful checks, you
can’t do so again until you reassert your control over the
dragon at least once with a casting of this spell.
The GM has the statistics for this creature, using a
graveyard dragon (see Tome of Beasts 2) or a young black
dragon with resistances and damage types appropriate to
the type of dragon you targeted with this spell and with
the following bonus action:
Reassemble Bones. As a bonus action, the dragon can
rearrange its bone structure to fit into a space as narrow as

slowly in a direction you choose. The grasping, shadowy
tendrils occupy up to three 10-foot cubes within range.
The mass has a speed of 20 feet, and it moves each round
at the end of your turn, ignoring difficult terrain. The
shadows can also move vertically or across a ceiling, as
long as they can travel along a surface on which to cling.
All light in this area is reduced to dim light. The surface
covered by the darkness is considered difficult terrain.
If the darkness moves into the space occupied by a
living creature, that creature takes 6d6 necrotic damage
and is restrained. The creature must make a Constitution
saving throw. On a successful save, the creature takes
half the damage and is not restrained. Any creature in
the area of the spell at the start of its turn must make
another Constitution saving throw, taking damage in each
round that it remains in the area. Restrained creatures
move with the darkness, dragged along by the shadowy
tendrils. A creature can take an action on its turn to make
a Strength check against your spell save DC to free itself
from the tendrils.
Bright light can destroy portions of the spell. One
10-foot cube is destroyed if it takes 12 radiant damage. As
long as at least one 10-foot cube occupies all or part of a
creature’s space, the creature remains restrained.

your body and dying immediately.
Each hostile creature within that explosion must make

You plant an obsidian acorn in solid ground and spend

infertile, regardless of its previous state. Nothing will grow

plants, such as entangle, require an ability check using the
caster’s spellcasting ability against your spell save DC.
On a successful check, the spell functions normally; if the
check fails, the spell is countered by desolation.
After one year, the land slowly reverts to its normal
fertility, rejoining the march of nature.
A living creature that finishes a short rest within the

outlining a secret door, a glow highlighting a trapped
flagstone, or a shimmering across the illusory wall that
hides a passage beyond it.
A secret door or hidden area, for the purpose of this

in some way by its creator. A trap, for the purpose of this
spell, includes anything that would inflict a sudden or
unexpected effect you consider harmful or undesirable,
which was specifically intended as such by its creator. Thus,
the spell would sense an area affected by the alarm spell, a
glyph of warding, a mechanical pit trap, a leaf-covered pit,
a door behind a hanging tapestry, or a door flush with a
stone wall that is opened by a pressing a specific stone.

an unstable ceiling, an evil tome “hidden” in plain sight

Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self
Components: V, S, M (a blue crystal)
Duration: Concentration, up to 3 rounds
Description:
You are surrounded by a field of glowing, blue energy
lasting 3 rounds. Creatures within 5 feet of you, including
yourself, must make a Constitution saving throw when
the spell is cast and again at the start of each of your turns
while the spell is in effect. A creature whose saving throw
fails is restrained; a restrained creature whose saving
throw fails is paralyzed; and a paralyzed creature whose
saving throw fails is petrified and transforms into a statue
of blue crystal. As with all concentration spells, you can
end the field at any time (no action required). If you are
turned to crystal, the spell ends after all affected creatures
make their saving throws. Restrained and paralyzed
creatures recover immediately when the spell ends, but
petrification is permanent.
Creatures turned to crystal can see, hear, and smell
normally, but they don’t need to eat or breathe. If
shatter is cast on a crystal creature, it must succeed on a
Constitution saving throw against the caster’s spell save
DC or be killed.
Creatures transformed into blue crystal can be restored
with dispel magic, greater restoration, or comparable magic.

School: Illusion
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour
Description:
You create 1d4 illusory copies of your weapon that float
in the air 5 feet from you. These images move with you,
spinning, shifting, and mimicking your attacks. When
you are hit by a melee attack but the attack roll exceeded
your Armor Class by 3 or less, one illusory weapon parries
the attack; you take no damage and the illusory weapon
is destroyed. When you are hit by a melee attack that an
illusory weapon can’t parry (the attack roll exceeds your
AC by 4 or more), you take only half as much damage
from the attack, and an illusory weapon is destroyed.
Spells and effects that affect an area or don’t require an
attack roll affect you normally and don’t destroy any
illusory weapons.
If you make a melee attack that scores a critical hit while
doom of dancing blades is in effect on you, all your illusory
weapons also strike the target and deal 1d8 bludgeoning,
piercing, or slashing damage (your choice) each.
The spell ends when its duration expires or when all
your illusory weapons are destroyed or expended.
An attacker must be able to see the illusory weapons to
be affected. The spell has no effect if you are invisible or in
total darkness or if the attacker is blinded.

Whenever a target that fails this saving throw makes an

Duration: Concentration, up to 5 rounds
Description:
When you cast doom of disenchantment, your armor and
shield glow with light. When a creature hits you with an
attack, the spell counters any magic that provides the attack
with a bonus to hit or to damage. For example, a +1 weapon
would still be considered magical, but it gets neither +1 to
hit nor +1 to damage on any attack against you.
The spell also suppresses other magical properties of
the attack. A sword of wounding, for example, can’t cause
ongoing wounds on you, and you recover hit points lost
to the weapon’s damage normally. If the attack was a spell,
it’s affected as if you had cast counterspell, using Charisma
as your spellcasting ability. Spells with a duration of
instantaneous, however, are unaffected.

Description:
You sever the bonds of friendship and affection between
your targets. Target two creatures of your choice within
range that can hear and see you. Each target must make
a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, a target must
use its movement and action to move toward and attack
the other target of the spell. If an unaffected target of
the spell moves out of range, the other target must make
every effort to find and attack it. At the end of each turn
that one of the targets cannot see the other target, it can
make a new saving throw, overcoming the compulsion on
a successful save.
Once all the spell’s targets make successful saving
throws, you become stunned until the end of your next
turn.
At Higher Levels. If you cast this spell using a 9th level
slot, you can target two additional creatures. Each of the
targets can decide on its turn which of the other targets it

All creatures within 10 feet of you must make a Wisdom
saving throw. You must also make this save. On a failed
save, targets become bumbling and inept for the duration
of the spell. When you cast this spell, choose one from the
following options:
• Choose one ability score. While doomed, the target has
disadvantage on ability checks and saving throws made
with that ability score.
• While doomed, the target falls prone at the start of each
round, and its speed is halved.
• While doomed, the target must make a Wisdom saving

its action that turn, doing nothing.

unable to stand up for the duration. Creatures with an
Intelligence score of 4 or less are not affected. At the end

You create a 30-foot-radius sphere of pulsing, luminous
purple mist centered on a point you choose within range.
This area is heavily obscured. When a creature enters the

half as much damage on a successful one. Creatures
are affected even if they hold their breath or don’t need
to breathe. After leaving the mist, the creature takes 5
points of necrotic damage per round until it succeeds on a
Constitution saving throw or dies.

You turn luck against a creature of your choice within
range. When the target makes an ability check, they must
first make a Charisma saving throw or the check fails.
This spell persists once cast, even if the target moves out
of range. If cast with a higher-level slot, each subsequent
effect is added to the effect noted above.
If the target ultimately succeeds on the check (or saving
throw or attack at higher levels), then you take 1 psychic
damage. If you ever unintentionally lose concentration on
the spell, you take 1d4 psychic damage.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell
slot of 2nd-level or higher, when the target is required
to make a saving throw, it must make a Charisma saving
throw in place of the required one, unless the required
one is more difficult to make. When you cast this spell
with a 4th-level slot, when the target makes an attack

You drink a dose of venom or other poison and spread
the effect to other living things around you. If the poison
normally allows a saving throw, your save automatically
fails. You suffer the effect of the poison normally before
spreading the poison to all other living creatures within
10 feet of you. Instead of making the usual saving throw
169
CHAPTER 5 SPELL DESCRIPTIONS
against the poison, each creature around you makes
a Constitution saving throw against the spell. On a
successful save, a target suffers no damage or other effect
from the poison and is immune to further castings of
doom of serpent coils for 24 hours. On a failed save, a target
doesn’t suffer the poison’s usual effect; instead, it takes
4d6 poison damage and is poisoned. While poisoned in
this way, a creature repeats the saving throw at the end
of each of its turns. On a subsequent failed save, it takes
4d6 poison damage and is still poisoned. On a subsequent
successful save, it is no longer poisoned and is immune to
further castings of doom of serpent coils for 24 hours.
Multiple castings of this spell have no additional effect
on creatures that are already poisoned by it. The effect can
be ended by protection from poison or comparable magic.

Description:
You and three creatures of your choice within range must
succeed on a Constitution saving throw when the spell is
cast and again at the start of each of your turns while the
spell is in effect. A creature whose saving throw fails is
restrained. If one of the three targeted creatures fails this
saving throw, as many as two other creatures (per initial
target), each within 30 feet of the initial target, must
make the same save. A restrained creature must continue
to make saving throws each turn, and their condition
worsens on a failure, as follows:
Number of
Turns Affected
Condition
1 (spell is cast)
Restrained
2
Incapacitated
3
Stunned
4
Paralyzed
5
Petrified (turned to stone)
Each condition afflicted adds to the previous conditions.
New saving throws reduce the severity of the condition
affecting a target by one step on a success. If a target
other than you succeeds on the saving throw while it is
restrained, the spell ends for it. (You must make a saving
throw each round.)
As with all concentration spells, you can end the spell at
any time (no action required). If you are turned to stone,
the spell ends after all affected creatures make their saving
throws. Creatures recover immediately when the spell
ends, except for creatures turned to stone, which remain
that way until the effect is removed.
Creatures turned to stone can see, hear, and smell
normally, but they don’t need to eat or breathe. If shatter is
cast on a stone creature, it must succeed on a Constitution
saving throw against the caster’s spell save DC or be killed.
Creatures transformed into stone can be restored with

Each round, a restrained creature sinks deeper into the
muck. A Medium or smaller creature that is restrained for
3 rounds becomes submerged at the end of its third turn.
A Large creature becomes submerged after 4 rounds.
Submerged creatures begin suffocating if they aren’t

You create a ripple of dark energy that destroys everything
it touches. A 10-foot-radius, 10-foot-deep, cylindrical
extradimensional hole appears on a horizontal surface of
sufficient size. Since it extends into another dimension,
the pit has no weight and does not otherwise displace the
original underlying material. You can create the pit in the
deck of a ship as easily as in a dungeon floor or the ground
of a forest.
The pit’s radius expands by 10 feet at the start of your
turn each round for the duration. Any creature standing
in the original conjured space, or on a space taken up by
the pit as it grows, must succeed on a Dexterity saving
throw to avoid falling in. Any creature adjacent to the pit
when it expands must likewise succeed on a Dexterity
saving throw to avoid falling in. Creatures subjected to
a successful pushing effect (such as by a spell like gust of
wind) may not make this saving throw. Creatures that fall
into the pit take falling damage as normal.
The walls of the pit are slick and slimy, requiring a DC
15 Strength (Athletics) check to climb. Creatures and
objects that remain in the pit take 1d6 necrotic damage
at the start of each of their turns. If you fall into your own
pit, you take damage; then the spell ends and you are
incapacitated for 2 rounds. When the spell ends, the floor
of the pit rises, bringing creatures in the pit back up to the

cause the tone of the dream to change to a nightmare (or
vice-versa) or influence a “character” in the dream other
than the target to act a certain way. When you attempt
to influence the dream, your target must succeed on a
Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a
failed save, your attempt to alter the dream is successful.
On a successful save, you are immediately ejected from the
dream as the dreamer awakens.

A thin green ray springs from your pointing finger to a

A wave of withering darkness erupts from you, filling a
120-foot-radius sphere and extinguishing any nonmagical
light sources in the area. Any light produced by spells
of 6th level or lower is dispelled. Magic items (but not
artifacts) that give off light have that property suppressed
while in the spell’s area. Any light sources brought into the
area during the spell’s duration are likewise extinguished.
Light-producing spells of 7th level or higher function
within the area.
Nonmagical light sources removed from the area can be
reignited. Magic items regain their ability to give off light
1 round after leaving the area. This magical darkness foils
darkvision, except for creatures that can see in magical
darkness, such as devils. You can see within the area of the
spell as if it were brightly lit.
Each creature you choose to be affected that ends its
turn in the darkness takes 4d8 necrotic damage and gains
one level of exhaustion. A successful Constitution saving

You conjure a magical suit of glass armor
over your existing armor and apparel for the duration.
The glass armor appears in any color and style you choose.
If you are wearing heavy armor, you have disadvantage
on attack rolls as the bulk of the glass armor on top of the

When you cast this spell, the armor has a number

Whenever you take cold, fire, lightning, or poison
damage, you can use your reaction to expend a charge
and reduce that damage to zero. The spell ends early if all
charges are expended.
If you take thunder damage while wearing this glass

Description:
You transform one sensory organ of a willing creature
you touch. Choose one of the target’s sensory organs
(eyes, nose, mouth, ears, or skin). In a blur of magical
bubbles that inflate and pop around it, the chosen organ
transforms into the corresponding organ of an animal,
enhancing the associated sense (sight for eyes, smell for
nose, taste for mouth, hearing for ears, and touch for
skin). For example, a pair of transformed eyes might
become like a chameleon’s or owl’s, while transformed
skin might become covered in millions of tiny hairs like
those on a spider or the skin of the target’s hand might
become exceptionally fleshy like a star-nosed mole’s nose.
Once before the spell ends, the target can grant itself
advantage on one Wisdom (Perception) check of its
choice using that sense. The spell then ends. At the GM’s
discretion, this advantage can be applied to a different
ability check related to the chosen sensory organ, such as
a rogue gaining advantage on a thieves’ tools check while
listening to the tumblers within a lock the rogue is picking.
This spell has no effect on a creature with a naturally
strong sense, such as a badger’s already-enhanced smell
from its Keen Smell trait (though this spell can be used to

mile of you. You then release the condensed memory of
that event in a blast that erupts in a 30-foot radius from
you. When you cast this spell, you can designate a number
of creatures equal to your spellcasting ability modifier to
be unaffected by it. The blast causes one of the following
effects of your choice:
Desiccate. Nearby water rapidly evaporates, including
the water within creatures. A body or container of water in
the spell’s area that fills a 10-foot cube or less evaporates
instantly, including water in containers that are being
worn or carried by creatures in the area. Each creature in
the spell’s area must make a Constitution saving throw,
taking 8d8 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as
much damage on a successful one. Creatures made mostly
of water, such as water elementals, have disadvantage on
the saving throw.
Swelter. The temperature of the air around you rises
dramatically. Each creature in the spell’s area must
make a Constitution saving throw, suffering 2 levels of
exhaustion on a failed save, or only 1 level of exhaustion
on a successful one.

Wind. Hot wind explodes out from you. Each Tiny
creature with a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower in the
area that doesn’t have total cover from you immediately
dies. Each Small or larger creature in the spell’s area must
make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature
takes 4d8 bludgeoning damage and 4d8 fire damage and
is pushed away from you up to the edge of the spell’s area
and knocked prone. On a successful save, a creature takes
half the damage and isn’t pushed or knocked prone.

signal beacon, or other source of fire that is large enough
for a Medium creature to stand in the fire. This rune lasts
for 30 days, and it remains even if the fire is extinguished.
For the duration, when you cast this spell again, you can
link any two runes together to form a gateway between
the two locations. The two runes linked in this way must
be on the same plane of existence, and each rune must
have an active fire source within 5 feet of it. While casting
this spell, you know if a rune you inscribed has an active
fire source within 5 feet of it. For 1 minute or until you
end the effect as a bonus action, any creature within 5 feet
of one of the fire sources can use 5 feet of its movement
to step into that fire source and exit from the other fire
source, appearing in an unoccupied space within 5 feet
of the destination fire source. A creature doesn’t take fire
damage from stepping into the fire. When this effect ends,
the runes disappear from both locations, ending the spell
if those were the only two runes inscribed with this spell.

prevents others from forming concrete memories of you.
Until the spell ends, a creature that interacts with a target
for less than 1 minute and in a way that isn’t impactful
remembers the target only passingly and with only
vague details. An impactful interaction includes combat,
being loud in a quiet crowd, or other interaction that
might be particularly memorable, such as being the only
person in drab, brown clothing at a noble’s extravagant,
colorful ball. At the GM’s discretion, other interactions
might be impactful to a creature based on that creature’s
personality, occupation, or other factors, such as a target
giving a gold coin to a beggar who hasn’t eaten in days.
The spell causes brief, non-impactful interactions with
the targets to be fleeting, vague memories. It doesn’t
change a target’s appearance or create any other form of
disguise that might help a target avoid notice.

the glyph)
When you cast this spell, you inscribe a glyph that later
unleashes a magical effect. You inscribe it either on a
surface (such as a table or a section of floor or wall) or
upon an object that can be carried (such as a book, a
shield, a belt pouch, or a similar item). The glyph can cover
an area of the surface no larger than 5 inches in diameter.
If the glyph is not triggered before you finish a long rest,
the glyph is broken, and the spell ends.
The glyph is nearly invisible and requires a successful
Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save
DC to be found.
You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the
spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical
triggers include touching or standing on the glyph,
removing another object covering the glyph, approaching
within a certain distance of the glyph, or manipulating
the surface on which the glyph is inscribed. For glyphs
inscribed on an object, the most common triggers include
touching that object, approaching within a certain
distance of the object, or seeing or reading the glyph.
Once a glyph is triggered, this spell ends.
You can further refine the trigger so the spell activates
only under certain circumstances or according to physical

creatures that don’t trigger the glyph, such as those who
say a certain password.
When triggered, the glyph erupts with magical
restorative energy in a 15-foot-radius sphere centered
on the glyph. The sphere spreads around corners. Each
creature in the area that isn’t a Construct or Undead can
choose one of the following effects:
• Healing. The creature regains 3d8 hit points.
• Restoration. The creature is cured of one

For the duration, you can use an action to see, hear,
smell, feel, and experience the world through the target’s

During this time, you are deaf and blind with regard to

Wisdom, or Charisma check it makes. If the target was a

If the target was an unwilling creature, you can give it
disadvantage on the check.

weapon attack against the maggot with a weapon that deals
piercing or slashing damage. The maggot has AC equal

the target itself. If the maggot is killed, the spell ends.

Description:

You target a creature of your choice within range with
a wasting of the flesh. Your target must succeed on a
Constitution saving throw or take 3d8 necrotic damage at
the beginning of each of its turns for the duration. A target
reduced to 0 hit points while under the effects of this spell
has disadvantage on its death saving throws.
If your target dies, you can raise it as a zombie as a
bonus action on your turn and can use a bonus action on
each of your subsequent turns to mentally command it
as long as you are within 60 feet of it. If you command
multiple undead as a result of multiple castings of
this spell or similar spells like animate dead, you can
command any or all of them at the same time using the
same bonus action, issuing the same command to each
one. You decide what action the creature will take and
where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a
general command, such as to guard a particular chamber
or corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature only
defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an
order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is
complete.
The creature is under your control for 24 hours, after
which it stops obeying any command you’ve given it. To
maintain control of the creature for another 24 hours, you
must expend a spell slot of 5th level or higher before the
current 24-hour period ends.
At Higher Levels. If you cast this spell using a 7th-level
spell slot, your target takes 6d8 necrotic damage at the
beginning of each of its turns and animates as a ghoul if it
dies. If you cast it using a 9th-level spell slot, it takes 9d8
necrotic damage and animates as a ghast if it dies.

which the spell consumes)
This spell instantly summons a glittering moonbeam that
transports one sleeping creature or object of your choice
that you can see within range to a destination you select.
If you target an unwilling creature, it can make a Wisdom
saving throw. On a successful save, the spell fails, and
you appear in the target location instead. A transferred
creature wakes up as soon as it arrives at its destination. If
you target an object, it must be able to fit entirely inside a
10-foot cube, and it can’t be held or carried by an unwilling
creature. The destination you choose must be known to
you, and it must be on the same plane of existence as you.
Your familiarity with the destination determines whether
the creature or object arrives there successfully.
The GM rolls a d20 and consults the Lunar Transfer
table below.
• Grove or Magic Circle means a hallowed druid
grove or a permanent teleportation circle whose sigil
sequence you know.
• Memento means that you possess an object taken
from the desired destination within the last six
months, such as a book from a wizard’s library, bed
linen from a royal suite, or a chunk of marble from a
lich’s secret tomb.
• Very Familiar is a place you have been very often, a
place you have carefully studied, or a place you can see
when you cast the spell.
• Seen Casually is someplace you have seen more than
once but with which you aren’t very familiar.
• Viewed Once is a place you have seen once, possibly
using magic.
• Description is a place whose location and appearance
you know through someone else’s description, perhaps
from a map.
• False Destination is a place that doesn’t exist.
Perhaps you tried to scry an enemy’s sanctum but
instead viewed an illusion, or perhaps you are
attempting to teleport to a familiar location that no
longer exists.
On Target. The target creature or object appears where
you want it to.
Off Target. The target creature or object appears a
random distance away from the destination in a random
direction. Distance off target is 5 miles times a d20 roll,
though never more than half the distance traveled. For
example, if you sent someone 250 miles and they landed
197
CHAPTER 5 SPELL DESCRIPTIONS
off target, and you rolled an 8 on the d20, then they would
arrive off target by 40 miles. If you had sent them only
20 miles, they could not be more than 10 miles off target.
The GM determines the direction off target randomly by
rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as
east, and so on around the points of the compass. If you
were teleporting someone to a coastal city and they wound
up 20 miles out at sea, they could be in trouble.
Similar. Your target creature or object winds up in a
different area that’s visually or thematically similar to the
target area. If you are sending someone to your home
laboratory, for example, they might wind up in another
wizard’s laboratory or in an alchemical supply shop that
has many of the same tools and implements as your
laboratory. Generally, the creature or object appears in the
closest similar place, but since the spell has no range limit,
they could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane.
Mishap. The spell’s unpredictable magic results in a
difficult journey. The teleporting creature or object takes
2d12 force damage, and the GM rerolls on the table to
see where you (instead of the target) wind up. (Multiple
mishaps can occur, dealing damage each time.)

Active magical effects of the chosen school, such as the

mage armor when dampening abjuration, are suppressed
while within this spell’s area. While an effect is suppressed,
it doesn’t function, but the time it spends suppressed

teleporting out of its current space and into the other
target’s space and vice versa. The two targets must be
within one size category of each other. A creature can’t be
teleported into damaging terrain or into a space it can’t
ordinarily occupy. For example, a creature that can’t fly
can’t switch places with a flying creature that is in the air,
but two creatures that can fly can be switched, regardless if
one is in the air.
An unwilling creature can make a Wisdom saving
throw, and if it succeeds, it isn’t affected by this spell.

A black corona surrounds a creature you can see within

black sand flakes away from the corona around the target
and settles into the hourglass you are holding. The target
must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save,
the target takes 1d6 necrotic damage, and it ages one hour.
On a successful save, the target takes half the damage and
doesn’t age one hour.
As part of casting this spell or as a bonus action on a
subsequent turn but before your next long rest, you can
consume this stolen hour of time. Alternatively, you can
gift the time to a friendly creature you can see within
range. As a bonus action at any point before your next

A creature that consumes the stolen hour of time can
expend Hit Dice to regain hit points as if it had completed
a short rest. The creature doesn’t gain any other benefits
of a short rest.

The warship is a Gargantuan vehicle that is 100 feet

the deck: two ballistae and two cannons.
Below deck is divided into two floors: the lower deck
and the hold. Each level of the ship is connected by
wooden stairs. Below deck is furnished and decorated
however you like, and it contains sufficient food to serve
a nine-course banquet for up to 60 people each day.
Furnishing, food, and other objects created by this spell
crumble to dust if removed from the ship.
A crew of forty invisible servants obeys any commands
given to it by creatures you designate when you cast the
spell. Each servant functions as if created by the unseen
servant spell.
The ship and the siege weapons aboard it are all made
of wood and metal that can be damaged, but they are
immune to poison damage and psychic damage. The hull
of the ship has AC 15 and 500 hit points. The ballistae have
AC 15 and 50 hit points each. The cannons have AC 19 and

you can see 100 feet in the sky directly above you. The spell
fails if you can’t see a point in the air where the rain cloud

the ground in the area is difficult terrain. Any creature

Your touch curses a creature that isn’t a Construct or
Undead with the symptoms of a disease of your choice,
which can include cackle fever, sewer plague, or any of the
diseases caused by the contagion spell or found in the
Random Disease table in Chapter 2. The target must
succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become convinced
it is suffering from a disease, including manifesting
physical symptoms. However, it suffers no actual damage,
conditions, or penalties from this disease. All symptoms
are superficial and vanish when the spell ends. This is a
curse, not a disease, and as such, spells and effects that
cure or detect diseases have no effect.
While cursed and manifesting symptoms, the target
emits an aura of hysterical fear. A creature that isn’t a
Construct or Undead and that comes within 60 feet of the
target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become
frightened of the target.
208

While frightened, that creature must take the Dash
action and move away from the target by the safest
available route on each of its turns, unless there is
nowhere to move. If the creature ends its turn in a location
where it doesn’t have line of sight to the cursed target, the
creature can make a Wisdom saving throw against your
spell save DC, ending the frightened condition on itself
on a success. If a creature’s saving throw is successful

leave. The mist remains in each of those spaces, forming
a trail behind you, for 10 minutes before fading. The mist
forms only along the ground and doesn’t form in spaces
you left by flying, swimming, or similarly not in contact

any effects of a disease. When exposed to a disease, the
creature must make the saving throw required. If the

particular affliction. The creature under the effect of the
spell is aware when it becomes infected. If the creature
recovers from or is cured of all diseases it suffers while this
spell is in effect, it continues to benefit from the spell until
the spell ends.

Intelligence of 5 or lower will not willingly bite you again,
seeking other prey instead. If such a creature is unable to
disengage from combat with you, it will use other attack
actions to deal damage, if possible, but will continue to
use its Bite attack if it has no other option.
If you are swallowed by a creature, immediately after
you take whatever damage is dealt by the creature’s

You return a dead creature you touch to a ghostly and
incorporeal form, provided it has been dead no longer
than 10 days. The creature can see and hear, and it can
speak in a hollow, sepulchral tone if it chooses to. Whether
it’s willing to speak to you depends on its whim and its
prior relationship with you, if any.
The affected creature is not undead; it is alive but
incorporeal, with 1 hit point. It can’t interact with the
physical world, attack or cause damage, or cast spells. It
is immune to nonmagical damage. It can move through
creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain, but
it takes 1d10 force damage if it ends its turn inside an
object. It regains hit points normally through resting or
spending Hit Dice but never recovers hit points via spells,
items, or potions.
This spell also neutralizes any poison and cures
nonmagical diseases that affected the creature at the time
it died. This spell doesn’t remove magical diseases, curses,
or similar effects; if these aren’t removed prior to casting
the spell, they take effect when the creature returns to life.
The spell also closes mortal wounds, but it doesn’t restore
missing body parts. If the creature is lacking body parts or
organs integral for its survival—its head, for instance—
the spell automatically fails.
Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The target has
a –4 penalty to saving throws and ability checks. Every
time the target finishes a long rest, the penalty is reduced
by 1 until it disappears.
A creature affected by raise ghost is restored to normal,
physical life by raise dead or comparable magic. Raise ghost
has no effect if cast on an Undead creature.

complete the task within 30 days. If it accepts but fails to
meet the conditions of the geas, it dies on the dawn of the
31st day and its spirit again departs the mortal world. If it
accomplishes the task, it’s free to live out the remainder of
its restored life as it chooses.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell
slot of 7th or 8th level, the creature has a year to fulfill its
geas, allowing for much more complex demands. When
you cast this spell using a spell slot of 9th level, the geas
lasts until it’s fulfilled, no matter how long that takes, or
until it’s ended by remove curse, greater restoration, or wish.

against a creature within reach. On a hit, you afflict the
creature with one of two possible rat plagues, described

make a Constitution saving throw. After failing three
of these saving throws, the disease’s effects last for the

Your magic summons an illusory recreation of an event,
allowing you to watch and learn from different angles.
When you cast this spell, choose a period of time you have
experienced within the last 7 days that is up to 1 minute
long. Illusory copies of the people, places, and events
that existed within 30 feet of you during that minute fill
the spell’s area. The illusion appears centered on the past
version of you and is recreated from your perspective at
the time you experienced it. The recreation is not limited
to your line of sight, and it magically recreates everything
that occurred within 30 feet of you at that time.
For the duration, you can command the illusion to
replay, pause, speed up, or slow down as you wish. You
and other creatures can walk within the illusory scene,
investigating and watching the event. You have advantage
on Intelligence (Investigation) and Wisdom (Perception)
checks made while observing the event. The spell doesn’t
provide insight into the minds of creatures that were
present at that time, and it is limited to actions and
movements that could have been observed by an average
person experiencing the event. For example, it might
depict wet footprints left by an invisible creature that
walked past you during the event, but it wouldn’t reveal
the invisible creature.

You can open a temporary portal between two darkened
areas, allowing you to move from one such area to another
without crossing the intervening space. If you start your
turn in an area of dim light or darkness, you can open a
portal to another area of dim light or darkness within
range and transport yourself to that spot. Doing this uses
up your movement for the turn, regardless of the distance
traveled. You can use shadow step while prone. Moving in
this manner does not draw opportunity attacks.

Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 30 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Description:
Writhing ribbons of quasi-real darkness extend from your
hand. As an action, you can make a melee spell attack with
the tendrils against any creature within range. On a hit,
the target takes 2d8 cold damage and must succeed at a
Dexterity saving throw or be restrained.
A creature that starts its turn restrained by the shadow
tendrils takes the cold damage again. It can take an action
to make a Dexterity check against your spell save DC to
free itself. On your turn, as a bonus action, you can drag
a creature restrained by the shadow tendrils up to 15 feet
closer to you.
The tendrils have AC 13 and 12 hit points. They are
immune to bludgeoning damage and to piercing and
slashing damage from nonmagical weapons. They are
vulnerable to radiant damage. If the tendrils are destroyed
by damage but the spell is still in effect, you can re-form
them on your turn as a bonus action.

You paint a small door approximately 2 feet square on
a hard surface to create a portal into the void of space.
The portal “peels off” the surface you painted it on and
follows you when you move, always floating in the air
within 5 feet of you. An icy chill flows out from the portal.
You can place up to 750 pounds of nonliving matter in the
portal, where it stays suspended in the frigid void until
you withdraw it. Items that are still inside the shadow
trove when the duration ends spill out onto the ground.
You can designate a number of creatures up to your
Intelligence modifier who have access to the shadow
trove; only you and those creatures can move objects into

Description:
If a creature you designate within range fails a Charisma
saving throw, you cause the target’s shadow to come
to life and reveal one of the creature’s most scandalous
secrets: some fact that the target would not want widely
known (GM’s choice). When casting the spell, you choose
whether everyone present will hear the secret, in which
case the shadow speaks loudly in a twisted version of the
target’s voice, or if the secret is whispered only to you. The
shadow speaks in the target’s native language.
If the target does not have a scandalous secret or
does not have a spoken language, the spell fails as if the
creature’s saving throw had succeeded.
If the secret was spoken aloud, the target takes a –2
penalty to Charisma checks involving anyone who was
222

target finishes a long rest.

You fill a small silver cup with your own blood (taking 1d4

Once the chant is completed, you consume the blood and
swear an oath of vengeance against any who harm you.
If you are reduced to 0 hit points, your oath is invoked;
a shadow materializes within 5 feet of you. The shadow
attacks the creature that reduced you to 0 hit points,
ignoring all other targets, until it or the target is slain, at
which point the shadow dissipates into nothing.
Ritual Focus. If you expend your ritual focus, the spell
summons a specter instead of a shadow.

2d8 bludgeoning damage and is buffeted by wind for the
duration. On a successful save, the target takes half the

Until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action on each

of movement for every 1 foot it moves in that direction.
At the end of each of its turns, the target can make
another Strength saving throw. On a success, the spell

half as much damage on a successful one. Each creature
then takes the same amount of damage at the start of each

You summon two Celestials of challenge rating 5 or lower,
which appear in a flash of golden lightning in unoccupied
spaces you can see within range. Each Celestial disappears
when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.
The Celestials are friendly to you and your companions.
Roll initiative for the Celestials as a group, which has
its own turns. They obey any verbal commands that you
issue to them (no action required by you), as long as the
commands don’t violate the Celestials’ alignment. If you
don’t issue any commands to them, the Celestials defend
themselves from hostile creatures but otherwise take no
actions.
If your concentration is broken, the Celestials don’t
disappear. Instead, you lose control of the Celestials,
and they may become hostile to you or aid you on their
own terms, depending on your alignment and observable
actions while the Celestials were summoned. An
uncontrolled Celestial can’t be dismissed by you, and it
disappears 1 hour after you summoned it.

You conjure up to three tornados on the ground at points
you can see within range. Each tornado is a 10-foot radius,
30-foot-tall cylinder of swirling air centered on the point.
Each creature that enters a tornado for the first time on a
turn or starts its turn in a tornado must make a Strength
saving throw. On a failed save, a Large or smaller creature
takes 4d10 bludgeoning damage and is thrown up to 60
feet in a random direction and knocked prone. On a failed
save, a Huge or larger creature takes 4d10 bludgeoning
damage but is restrained until the start of its next turn
instead of being thrown. On a successful save, a creature
takes half the damage and isn’t thrown, restrained, or
knocked prone, but it is pushed out of the tornado to an
unoccupied space within 5 feet of the edge of the tornado.
If a thrown creature strikes a solid surface, the creature
takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it was
thrown. If the creature is thrown at another creature,
that creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw
against your spell save DC or take the same damage and
be knocked prone. If a thrown creature is thrown into
another tornado, it is then thrown up to 60 feet again in a
random direction from that tornado.
At the start of each of your turns, the tornados move up
to 30 feet in random directions and can affect you as easily
as any other creature. If multiple tornados would move to
the same space, one tornado moves to the space, and the
other moves to within 10 feet of the space. The spell ends
early if you are incapacitated or die.

As a creature of your size or larger approaches, you
magically step into the creature, melding yourself and
all the equipment you carry with the creature until the
start of your next turn. A hostile creature must succeed
on a Wisdom saving throw to avoid the effect. At the start
of your next turn, you emerge from the target into an
unoccupied space within 5 feet of the target.
While merged with the target, nothing of your presence
remains visible or otherwise detectable by nonmagical
senses. You can’t see what occurs outside the target
and any Wisdom (Perception) checks you make to hear
sounds outside it have disadvantage. You remain aware of
the passage of time, but you can’t move or cast spells on
yourself while merged.
The creature you meld with is aware of your presence,
and it can move and take actions normally. Damage to the
creature doesn’t affect you. However, if the creature dies
or is transformed while you are merged with it, you are
expelled into the nearest unoccupied space, fall prone,
and take 25 bludgeoning damage and 25 necrotic damage.
